Title: Entrepreneurial Founder Teams: Factors Associated with Member Entry and Exit
Author-Name: Ucbasaran, Deniz
Author-Name: Lockett, Andy
Author-Name: Wright, Mike
Author-Name: Westhead, Paul
Abstract: This exploratory study provides a review of the neglected area of entrepreneurial founder team turnover. A novel distinction is made between entrepreneurial founder team member entry and team member exit. Ninety owner-managed ventures were monitored between 1990 and 2000. Presented hypotheses relating to a team's human capital were explored using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables associated with entry were found not to be the same as those associated with exit. The size of the founding team was significantly negatively associated with subsequent team member entry. The link between team turnover and entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was mixed. Functional heterogeneity was weakly significantly positively associated with team member entry. Heterogeneity of prior entrepreneurial experience was significantly positively associated with team member exit. In addition, family firms were significantly negatively associated with team member exit. The average age of the team was not significantly associated with team member entry or exit. Additional insights in future research may be gathered if a broader definition of team turnover (i.e., considering team member entry and exit) is considered. Practitioner awareness of the different factors associated with team member entry and exit may encourage them to provide assistance, which facilitates the team building process over time in developing firms. Promising areas for additional research are highlighted.

Title: Enterprise Education: Influencing Students’ Perceptions of Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Peterman, Nicole E.
Author-Name: Kennedy, Jessica
Abstract: This research examines the effect of participation in an enterprise education program on perceptions of the desirability and feasibility of starting a business. Changes in the perceptions of a sample of secondary school students enrolled in the Young Achievement Australia (YAA) enterprise program are analysed using a pre-test post-test control group research design. After completing the enterprise program, participants reported significantly higher perceptions of both desirability and feasibility. The degree of change in perceptions is related to the positiveness of prior experience and to the positiveness of the experience in the enterprise education program. Self-efficacy theory is used to explain the impact of the program. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence to support including exposure to entrepreneurship education as an additional exposure variable in entrepreneurial intentions models.

Title: The Boundaries and Limitations of Agency Theory and Stewardship Theory in the Venture Capitalist/Entrepreneur Relationship
Author-Name: Arthurs, Jonathan D.
Author-Name: Busenitz, Lowell W.
Abstract: The dynamic ownership arrangements surrounding the venture capitalist–entrepreneur (VC-E) relationship inherent in new ventures make the examination of principals’ or venture capitalists’ (VCs) and agents’ (entrepreneurs) governance arrangements interesting to explore. This article examines the limitations of agency theory and then stewardship theory in explaining the behaviors of individuals in the VC-E relationship. Our analysis points out the potential problems inherent in each theory's explanatory ability as it relates to the VC-E relationship. Lastly, theoretical gaps in the VC-E relationship are discussed along with suggestions for new theory surrounding this important and intriguing relationship.

Title: SME Survey Methodology: Response Rates, Data Quality, and Cost Effectiveness
Author-Name: Newby, Rick
Author-Name: Watson, John
Author-Name: Woodliff, David
Abstract: Cost effective data collection is an important methodological issue for small and medium enterprise (SME) researchers. There is a generally held view that mail surveys are the most efficient means of collecting empirical data, despite the potential difficulties associated with low response rates. To enhance the usefulness of mail surveys, researchers have suggested a variety of strategies aimed at improving response rates. While previous studies have examined the effect on response rates of many of these strategies, their impact on data quality and on the cost effectiveness of data collection is less well understood. This study evaluates four response-inducing strategies (printing the survey instrument on colored paper, telephone pre-notification, payment of a monetary incentive, and a follow-up mailing) in terms of their effect on data quality, response rates, and cost effectiveness for a population of SMEs.

Title: Zandinger!
Author-Name: Tompson, George H. (Jody)
Abstract: Most cases in entrepreneurship address strategic or operating difficulties of recently formed organizations. The case study presented here addresses an organization in its earliest stage of the life cycle: pre start-up. The case is about an entrepreneur who is planning to create a new venture based on a board game invented by his uncle. Accordingly, the case requires students to prioritize the tasks to create a venture from ground zero. The entrepreneur in this case already owns another successful business, has good marketing skills, and has received accolades from an expert in the toy industry. He seems to have a potentially successful product but is uncertain about what to do next. The case presents information for assessing industry structure and competitiveness, manufacturing options, and target marketing.

Abstract: The failure of past “entrepreneurial personality”—based research to clearly distinguish the unique contributions to the entrepreneurial process of entrepreneurs as people, has created a vacuum within the entrepreneurship literature that has been waiting to be filled. Recently, the application of ideas and concepts from cognitive science has gained currency within entrepreneurship research, as evidenced by the growing accumulation of successful studies framed in entrepreneurial cognition terms. In this article we reexamine “the people side of entrepreneurship” by summarizing the state of play within the entrepreneurial cognition research stream, and by integrating the five articles accepted for publication in this special issue into this ongoing narrative. We believe that the constructs, variables, and proposed relationships under development within the cognitive perspective offer research concepts and techniques that are well suited to the analysis of problems that require better explanations of the contributions to entrepreneurship that are distinctly human.

Title: The Relationship Among Biases, Misperceptions, and the Introduction of Pioneering Products: Examining Differences in Venture Decision Contexts
Author-Name: Simon, Mark
Author-Name: Houghton, Susan M.
Abstract: Although biases influence the decision to take entrepreneurial actions, studies have not differentiated among entrepreneurial decision environments. These environments vary greatly and affect which biases arise and their context-specific consequences. Focusing on the role of firm size, age, and type of product introduction, we propose that entrepreneurs in smaller, younger, firms, who are considering pioneering, are more likely to exhibit illusion of control, law of small numbers, and reasoning by analogy. These biases contribute to underestimating competition, overestimating demand, and overlooking requisite assets. We hope to spur researchers to examine information processing across different types of entrepreneurial firms and actions.

Author-Name: Keh, Hean Tat
Author-Name: Foo, Maw Der

Abstract: Even though the entrepreneurship literature places much emphasis on opportunity recognition, little is known about how entrepreneurs actually evaluate opportunities. This study uses a cognitive approach to examine opportunity evaluation, as the perception of opportunity is essentially a cognitive phenomenon. We present a model that consists of four independent variables (overconfidence, belief in the law of small numbers, planning fallacy, and illusion of control), a mediating variable (risk perception), two control variables (demographics and risk propensity), and the dependent variable (opportunity evaluation). We find that illusion of control and belief in the law of small numbers are related to how entrepreneurs evaluate opportunities. Our results also indicate that risk perception mediates opportunity evaluation.

Title: Inventors and New Venture Formation: the Effects of General Self‐Efficacy and Regretful Thinking
Author-Name: Markman, Gideon D.
Author-Name: Balkin, David B.
Author-Name: Baron, Robert A.
Abstract: This research assesses two individual differences—general self-efficacy and regretful thinking—in the context of technological innovation. Results, obtained from a random sample of 217 patent inventors show that both general self-efficacy and regretful thinking distinguish inventors who started a business (i.e., technological entrepreneurs) from inventors who did not start a new business (i.e., technological nonentrepreneurs). More to the point, patent inventors, who at the time of our survey were actively involved in new business formation, tended to have significantly higher self-efficacy. Also, while technological entrepreneurs tended to have stronger regrets about business opportunities, technological nonentrepreneurs tended to have stronger regrets regarding career and education decisions. The two groups did not differ in terms of the quantity of these regrets. Implications for theory, practice, and future study of individual differences in entrepreneurship are discussed.

Title: An Intentions‐Based Model of Entrepreneurial Teams’ Social Cognition*
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Author-Name: Krueger, Norris F.
Abstract: Research has identified crucial antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship. Research has also identified crucial antecedents of entrepreneurial thinking. This article uses lessons from social cognition to explicitly link these two issues. We adapt an intentions-based model of how to promote entrepreneurial thinking from its original domain of individual entrepreneurship and translate that model to the domain of corporate entrepreneurship. From our intentions-based model of the social cognition of entrepreneurial teams, we emphasize the importance of perceptions of desirability and feasibility and that these perceptions are from the team as well as the individual perspective. This leads to three propositions about entrepreneurial teams and an outline of the opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Research to date has not adequately explained the role that expectancy of entrepreneurial performance based on perceived ability plays in motivating persons to persevere on an entrepreneurial task. This study investigated the entrepreneurial expectancy, effort-performance linkage via a World Wide Web–based experiment involving 179 undergraduate business students at a large midwestern university. Results indicated that the type of feedback (positive versus negative) that individuals received regarding their entrepreneurial ability (regardless of actual ability) changed expectancies regarding future business start-up, but did not alter task effort or quality of performance. Individuals receiving positive feedback about their entrepreneurial abilities had higher entrepreneurial expectancies than individuals receiving negative feedback. We also found that males had higher expectancies regardless of experimental condition than females.

Title: Competitive Strategy and Performance of Exporting SMEs: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Their Export Information Search and Competencies
Author-Name: Julien, Pierre–André
Author-Name: Ramangalahy, Charles
Abstract: The SMEs’ limited capacity to acquire information and use sources is a major factor explaining their low level of involvement and performance on export markets. Nonetheless, a small amount of applied research has been undertaken on this subject. We present the results of an inquiry into the impact of information search and competencies on the competitive strategy and export performance of 346 exporting manufacturing SMEs. The research model postulates that the performance of these SMEs is determined by their general competitive strategy, which in turn is explained by the ability of the business to acquire and manage foreign market information. The results of an analysis using a PLS method confirm three of the four hypotheses.

Title: What Do They Think and Feel about Growth? An Expectancy–Value Approach to Small Business Managers’ Attitudes Toward Growth
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Delmar, Frédéric
Abstract: This study focuses on small business managers’ motivation to expand their firms. More specifically, we examine the relationships between expected consequences of growth on the one hand, and overall attitude toward growth on the other. Data were collected in three separate studies over a ten–year period using the same measuring instrument. The results suggest that noneconomic concerns may be more important than expected financial outcomes in determining overall attitude toward growth. In particular, the concern for employee well–being comes out strongly. We interpret this as reflecting a concern that the positive atmosphere of the small organization may be lost in growth. We conclude that this concern may be a cause for recurrent conflict for small business managers when deciding about the future route for their firms.

Abstract: Initial public offerings (IPOs) have been a prominent focus of academic and popular press attention, especially in recent years. Much of this attention can be attributed to the increase in IPO activity as a function of the “dot com” phenomenon. Of particular interest to both academics and practitioners is IPO underpricing. Review of existing research suggests little consensus regarding those factors associated with underpricing. We provide a meta–analysis of published studies. Our findings reveal a number of significant relationships, many of which are opposite that predicted by signaling theory. Implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Help One Another, Use One Another: Toward an Anthropology of Family Business
Author-Name: Stewart, Alex
Abstract: Anthropological kinship theory is explored for potential contributions to a theory of family business. This article considers the costs and benefits of a role for kinship in business. Both derive from the discrepancy between the normative orders of kinship and markets; respectively, long-term generalized reciprocity and short-term balanced reciprocity. Because the former reflects the morality of society as a whole, kinship integrates social fields more readily than more specialized orders like markets.

Abstract: Few studies in the mainstream management literature have included the family as a variable. The focus of this article is to describe (1) why there is a dearth of research using family as a variable; (2) how failing to use the family as a variable in organizational research can lead to incomplete or misleading findings; (3) the issues and concerns related to using the family as a variable in organizational research; and (4) options in research design for using the family as a variable. Given that the vast majority of organizations can be classified as “family firms,” including the family as a variable in research designs will provide researchers with theories that are more robust and that can be generalized to a larger population of organizations.

Title: Social Networks and Entrepreneurship

Author-Name: Salaff, Janet W.
Abstract: We study network activities of entrepreneurs through three phases of establishing a firm in four countries. Entrepreneurs access people in their networks to discuss aspects of establishing and running a business. We find that entrepreneurs build networks that systematically vary by the phase of entrepreneurship, analyzing number of their discussion partners, and the time spent networking. Entrepreneurs talk with more people during the planning than other phases. Family members are present in their networks in all phases, particularly among those who took over an existing firm. However, women use their kin to a larger extent than men, and even more than men when they take over an existing firm. Experienced entrepreneurs have the same networking patterns as novices. Moreover, these networking patterns are the same in all countries. However, there are country differences in size of discussion networks and time spent networking.

Abstract: The goal of this interdisciplinary study is to analyze the entrepreneurial personality in the context of resources, environment, and the startup process based on a configurational approach. The study focuses on the startup process. A questionnaire was developed to measure the configuration areas of personality, personal resources, environment, and organizing activities. A representative sample of 1,169 nascent entrepreneurs and new business owner-managers was examined. Three startup configurations were found which reveal different patterns of personality characteristics. These patterns are interpreted in the context of aspects of the environment, the resources, and the startup process.

Title: Professional Employer Organizations and Their Role in Small and Medium Enterprises: The Impact of HR Outsourcing
Author-Name: Klaas, Brian S.
Abstract: While effective HR services and programs can help firms gain competitive advantage, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often lack the internal resources required to develop and deliver these services and programs. As a result, SMEs increasingly are outsourcing HR activities to professional employer organizations (PEOs). Questions remain, however, about the conditions under which SMEs will benefit from outsourcing HR to a PEO, as well as about the type of benefits that are potentially available. The very nature of many HR activities raises questions about the risks associated with market governance and a PEO's ability to ensure service quality for SMEs. In order for these questions to be addressed, it is necessary to understand the process by which PEO utilization affects SME outcomes. In this article, we use transaction cost economics, social exchange theory, and the strategic HR literature to develop a framework for understanding the factors and conditions likely to affect whether and how an SME will benefit from using a PEO.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between firm absorptive capacity and organizational responsiveness in the context of growth-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By testing the different dimensions of absorptive capacity, external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination were found to be positively related to organizational responsiveness. In addition, the relationships between absorptive capacity and organizational responsiveness were moderated by environmental dynamism and the SMEs’ strategic orientation. Results demonstrate that the responsiveness of growth-oriented SMEs is expected to increase if (1) they have well-developed capabilities in external knowledge acquisition and intrafirm knowledge dissemination; (2) they have a well-developed external knowledge acquisition capability and adopt a more proactive strategy, such as being a prospector; (3) they face a turbulent environment and have a well developed internal knowledge dissemination capability. Implications and future research directions are provided.

Author-Name: Evans, Anne G.

Abstract: This case describes Anne Evans’ search for a market opportunity in the biotechnology industry, and examines the feasibility of establishing a new venture to exploit this opportunity. The drug development process in the biopharmaceutical industry spans three critical phases: pharmaceutical discovery, pharmaceutical development, and product marketing. The drug development process is a very capital-intensive process with expenditures averaging $800 million per drug and with very high failure rates—only one out of 5,000 compounds that emerge from discovery and preclinical testing will make it into the market. The drug development process therefore contributes to very high cash burn rates and corporate failures in the biotechnology industry.

Abstract: The premise of this article is that the management team of a small firm plays a key role in internationalization outcomes. Specifically, it is hypothesized that a greater degree of behavioral integration within a small firm's management team enables it to manage the complexity of foreign sales growth more effectively, leading to greater overall firm growth. Findings, based on data collected from two different industries (software products, food processing), support the hypothesis and indicate that the behavioral integration of the management team moderates the relationship between foreign sales growth and overall firm growth.

Abstract: Scholars (e.g., Burgel & Murray, 2000; Jones, 1999; Zacharakis, 1997) have suggested that small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) international entry mode selection is an important new research area. In this study we attempt to determine if a model of large firm entry mode selection can be applied to SME entry mode choice. Using Dunning's eclectic framework, we examined SME entry into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). We found that Dunning's eclectic framework did a good job of predicting SME entry mode selection in CEE markets. Managerial implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Title: Early Retirees As the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Singh, Gangaram
Author-Name: DeNoble, Alex
Abstract: In this article, we combine perspectives from labor economics and entrepreneurship to examine early retirees’ decision to become self-employed. Many individuals leave career employment before the traditional age of 65 and return to the labor market for a period of time before they fully retire. This phenomenon is referred to in the labor economics literature as bridge employment. Initial research of bridge employment has identified entrepreneurial activities to be common. The authors argue that first early retirees have to make the decision whether to permanently retire or to continue their labor force participation. If they decide to return to work, then self-employment is one option. Using the theoretical foundations of entrepreneurship, the authors outline the factors that would influence the self-employment choice and the types of entrepreneurial paths emanating from that choice.

Title: Competitive Strategy and Performance of Exporting SMEs: An Empirical Investigation of the Impact of Their Export Information Search and Competencies
Author-Name: Julien, Pierre‐André
Author-Name: Ramangalahy, Charles
Abstract: The SMEs’ limited capacity to acquire information and use sources is a major factor explaining their low level of involvement and performance on export markets. Nonetheless, a small amount of applied research has been undertaken on this subject. We present the results of an inquiry into the impact of information search and competencies on the competitive strategy and export performance of 346 exporting manufacturing SMEs. The research model postulates that the performance of these SMEs is determined by their general competitive strategy, which in turn is explained by the ability of the business to acquire and manage foreign market information. The results of an analysis using a PLS method confirm three of the four hypotheses.

Title: What Do They Think and Feel about Growth? An Expectancy‐Value Approach to Small Business Managers’ Attitudes Toward Growth
Author-Name: Wiklund, Johan
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Delmar, Frédéric
Abstract: This study focuses on small business managers’ motivation to expand their firms. More specifically, we examine the relationships between expected consequences of growth on the one hand, and overall attitude toward growth on the other. Data were collected in three separate studies over a ten-year period using the same measuring instrument. The results suggest that noneconomic concerns may be more important than expected financial outcomes in determining overall attitude toward growth. In particular, the concern for employee well-being comes out strongly. We interpret this as reflecting a concern that the positive atmosphere of the small organization may be lost in growth. We conclude that this concern may be a cause for recurrent conflict for small business managers when deciding about the future route for their firms.

Abstract: Initial public offerings (IPOs) have been a prominent focus of academic and popular press attention, especially in recent years. Much of this attention can be attributed to the increase in IPO activity as a function of the “dot com” phenomenon. Of particular interest to both academics and practitioners is IPO underpricing. Review of existing research suggests little consensus regarding those factors associated with underpricing. We provide a meta-analysis of published studies. Our findings reveal a number of significant relationships, many of which are opposite that predicted by signaling theory. Implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Managing Resources: Linking Unique Resources, Management, and Wealth Creation in Family Firms
Author-Name: Sirmon, David G.
Author-Name: Hitt, Michael A.
Abstract: The appropriate resources are necessary but insufficient to achieve a competitive advantage. Resources must also be managed effectively. Herein, we develop a resource management process model composed of three components that can lead to a competitive advantage. These components include the resource inventory (evaluating, adding, and shedding), resource bundling, and resource leveraging. We examine resource management in family firms and thus explore the unique characteristics of five resources and attributes of family firms that provide potential advantages over nonfamily firms. The resources are human capital, social capital, patient capital, survivability capital, along with the governance structure attribute.

Title: Agency Problems in Large Family Business Groups
Author-Name: Morck, Randall
Author-Name: Yeung, Bernard
Abstract: Greater managerial ownership in family firms need not mitigate agency problems, especially when each family controls a group of publicly traded and private firms, as is the case in most countries. Such structures give rise to their own set of agency problems, as managers act for the controlling family, but not for shareholders in general. For example, to avoid what we call “creative self-destruction,” a family might quash innovation in one firm to protect its obsolete investment in another. At present, we do not know whether these agency problems are more or less serious impediments to general prosperity than those afflicting widely held firms.

Abstract: Effective competitive analysis (CA) is important for success in today's marketplace. CA may be particularly important to new ventures that may lack experience in their industries and knowledge of their rivals. Using survey data from 228 new ventures, this study concludes that the formality, comprehensiveness, and user orientation of CA activities are positively associated with new venture performance. Strategic uncertainty and venture origin also significantly moderate the relationship between CA and new venture performance.

Title: Is Extraordinary Growth Profitable? A Study of Inc. 500 High‐Growth Companies
Author-Name: Markman, Gideon D.
Author-Name: Gartner, William B.
Abstract: This research note tests whether extraordinary high growth (e.g., sales growth rates of 500 percent to 31,000 percent over five years) is correlated to firm profitability. Using longitudinal data from three separate cohorts of Inc. 500 firms (from 1992 to 1996; 1993 to 1997; and 1994 to 1998), firm growth was operationalized in terms of sales and number of employees. Controlling for industry sector and ranking on the Inc. 500 lists, analyses found that extraordinary high growth—in terms of sales and number of employees—was not related to firm profitability. Firm age, however, was significantly, and inversely, related to profitability; younger firms experience slightly higher profitability rates. Implications for management and future study of extraordinary high-growth firms are discussed.

Title: Institutional Determinants of Macro‐Level Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Valdez, Michael E.
Author-Name: Richardson, James
Abstract: This multicountry study empirically explores the institutional determinants of macro-level entrepreneurship. Findings suggest that a society's normative, cultural-cognitive, and regulative institutions are related to entrepreneurial activity. Normative and cultural-cognitive institutions’ descriptive power in explaining entrepreneurial activity is higher than regulative institutions' or per capita gross domestic product. This suggests that differences in values, beliefs, and abilities may play a greater role than purely economic considerations of opportunity and transaction costs. Specific attention is given to opportunity- and necessity-motivated entrepreneurship due to their relationship to economic development.

Author-Name: Reed, Richard
Abstract: Research on organization slack has focused mainly on its effect in large publicly traded firms, but little work exists on the value of slack resources for other firms. Therefore, here, we address the question: Do slack resources matter in the case of initial public offerings (IPOs)? We argue that firms that possess financial, innovational, and managerial slack resources are sending a positive signal to potential investors regarding the quality of the IPO. Using a sample of high-tech IPOs, we find support for that contention.

Abstract: Applying insights from the generational perspective, this study explores when strategic planning and succession planning are most conducive to privately held family firm growth. The results show that the degree to which strategic planning and succession planning are associated with family firm growth depends on the generation managing the firm. Both forms of planning are most conducive to the growth of first-generation firms; however, neither form of planning confers much growth for second-generation firms. For third-and-beyond-generation firms, the benefits of succession planning appear to reemerge. However, strategic planning is negatively associated with their level of growth.

The company's three main sets of investors have different priorities: (1) a quick cash sale now, (2) delay sale for about a year if returns are greater, and (3) delay sale for 2 years, build company value, and retain autonomy. What choice would be best for the company, for its investors—and for Ken himself? And when would be the best time to implement the exit strategy?

Abstract: Metaphors are powerful tools for sensemaking, sensegiving, and theory development, but they are often concealed in academic writing. This paper uncovers two metaphors underlying entrepreneurship discourse and research—elixir and mutagen. The elixir metaphor is uncovered by examining critiques of entrepreneurship research, and serves as a compact description of problematic aspects entrepreneurship scholars should be mindful of. The mutagen metaphor is uncovered by examining evolutionary frameworks, focusing on the role entrepreneurship plays in them. The paper illustrates how the mutagen metaphor can be used to reframe entrepreneurship, and uses the metaphors to interest, inform, and provoke.

Title: Return on Recent VC Investment and Long‐Run IPO Returns
Author-Name: Michel, Jean‐Sébastien
Abstract: This paper examines the return on recent venture capital (VC) investment and its impact on the long-run stock market performance of initial public offerings (IPOs). Firms with higher return on recent VC investment underperform firms with lower return on recent VC investment by 32 to 43% in the 3-year period following the offer. This effect is robust to various risk-adjustment procedures. Market conditions at the time of the VC valuation and changes in these market conditions thereafter are the main drivers of this result, suggesting that investors are too optimistic or do not properly understand the informational content of the recent return on VC investment.

Abstract: Little is known about the drivers of entrepreneurial decisions during war. We empirically examine the effects of perceived danger, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and resilience on entrepreneurial intentions in adverse conditions with primary survey data from Afghanistan. Our findings suggest that perceived danger is negatively related to an individual's entrepreneurial intentions, but marginally less so among highly resilient individuals. Our findings also suggest that even under conditions of war, individuals develop entrepreneurial intentions if they are able to grow from adversity (resilience) and believe in their entrepreneurial abilities (entrepreneurial self-efficacy). Practical implications for role modeling and entrepreneurship training are then discussed.

Author-Name: Meuleman, Miguel
Abstract: This paper studies the role of entrepreneurs in investment tie formation in science-based entrepreneurial firms. Specifically, we address why investment tie formation is path dependent for some firms but more amenable to intentional management for others. Using longitudinal case studies, our evidence suggests that early investment tie formation is path dependent because scientific entrepreneurs typically approach only one or a few prospective investors from within their institutional context. Differences in experience between early investors affect the professionalization of entrepreneurial teams (or lack thereof), which influences the extent to which subsequent investment tie formation becomes more amenable to intentional management or remains path dependent.

Title: Using Resource‐Based Theory to Help Explain Plural Form Franchising
Author-Name: Gillis, William E.
Author-Name: Combs, James G.
Author-Name: Ketchen, David J.
Abstract: Agency theory is the dominant explanation for entrepreneurs' decisions about how much to grow through franchising vis-à-vis company ownership. We introduce a resource-based explanation and submit that the proportion franchised is influenced by efforts to organize franchisor-owned and relational strategic assets so that their value can be best leveraged to meet key strategic goals. Using data from 168 franchisors, we found that relational (i.e., interfirm trust and knowledge-sharing routines), but not franchisor-owned (i.e., brand reputation and operating routines), strategic assets influence the proportion franchised. The study offers preliminary evidence that resource-based theory has merit as a complementary explanation for franchising.

Abstract: Access to resources is a key challenge facing entrepreneurs during early venture development. Entrepreneurs' networks serve as a principal means of identifying and acquiring needed resources. However, different stages of venture development may address different resource dependencies, suggesting entrepreneurs' networks may need to change to meet changing resource requirements. By employing network theory and resource-dependence theory, we investigate how entrepreneurs may use networks to address changing resource needs during early venture development. Results illustrate how structural characteristics of entrepreneurs' networks at venture launch are associated with network structure and content in early venture development in ways that may promote access to newly needed resources.

Abstract: This case takes place in Russia in 2008, not quite 20 years into the post-Soviet developing economy. DiPaul was an authorized dealer of electronic instruments, equipment, and materials for the production and assembly of printed circuit boards as well as soldering equipment. Its core business was supplying measurement instruments and process equipment. In the summer of 2008, the chief executive officer, who was also the majority stockholder, decided to reassign authority in a formal organizational transition so that he could become more engaged in policy and leadership of the Association of Russian Producers of Electronic Appliances and Instruments. The protagonist's concerns were as follows: How to carry out such a management transition? Who among the top management team could fit the position best? How must the organizational structure of the company be changed to accommodate the shift in leadership? And importantly, what should his own future role be?

Title: How Exactly Do Network Relationships Pay Off? The Effects of Network Size and Relationship Quality on Access to Start‐Up Resources
Author-Name: Semrau, Thorsten
Author-Name: Werner, Arndt
Abstract: Entrepreneurs are expected to profit from network relationships. Research addressing the link between entrepreneurs' network characteristics and their performance, however, has so far produced inconclusive results. In an attempt to explain these inconsistencies, we investigate the resource returns connected to network size and relationship quality. Based on a sample of 379 nascent entrepreneurs, we find that increasing network size and relationship quality results in diminishing marginal returns in terms of access to financial capital, knowledge and information, and additional business contacts. Additionally, we observe that the returns vary strongly by resource type.

Author-Name: Drover, Will

Author-Name: Payne, G. Tyge
Abstract: Drawing on agency and configurations theories, this study examines how perceived level of control over the entrepreneur influences venture capitalist (VC) decision making. We model the direct effects of perceived control and the interactive effects of control with entrepreneurial prestige and opportunity attractiveness to determine how various combinations of factors influence VCs’ willingness to invest. We test our conceptualizations using conjoint analyses of 552 VC investment decisions. The results show that perceived control is directly related to investment likelihood, but different configurations of control, entrepreneur prestige, and opportunity attractiveness result in different outcomes. Our findings support a configurational perspective of VC decision making.

Title: On the Theory of Entrepreneurial Incentives and Alertness
Author-Name: McCaffrey, Matthew
Abstract: This paper analyzes the theory of “entrepreneurial incentives” in the work of Israel Kirzner. It argues that there is a logical problem with the notion of profit opportunities as exogenous causal agents: Without additional assumptions, the existence of opportunities alone does not sufficiently explain the alertness of entrepreneurs. The paper considers both stronger and weaker versions of this problem. It also questions the relation between entrepreneurial incentives and the tendency toward entrepreneurial success. Finally, it provides some commentary on the relevance of entrepreneurial incentives for an overall theory of the entrepreneur, and identifies several potential solutions to the problems discussed.

Author-Name: Chrisman, James J.

Author-Name: Misra, Kaustav
Abstract: We explain why family-centered noneconomic goals and bounded rationality decrease the willingness and ability of small- and medium-sized family firms to hire and provide competitive compensation to nonfamily managers even in a labor market composed of stewards rather than agents. Family-centered noneconomic goals attenuate the ability to attract high-quality, nonfamily managers by promoting inferior total compensation packages, fewer opportunities for advancement, idiosyncratic strategies, and higher performance expectations. Furthermore, bounded rationality limits nonfamily managers' ability to meet performance expectations when hired. The result is the “winner's curse,” where neither the economic nor noneconomic goals of family owners are fully achieved.

Abstract: This analysis has evaluated the impact of mergers on new entrepreneurial firm entry in the territories of firms making up the local exchange sector of the United States telecommunications industry. An analysis of first and second mergers undertaken by the local exchange companies has revealed that where mergers occurred there was significantly lower entrepreneurial entry. The results have implications for policy, since the approval of mergers has been shown to lead to lower entrepreneurial entry where mergers occur, and the approval of mergers may serve to impede entrepreneurship. Hence, greater thought should be given to merger approvals so that entrepreneurship and the process of economic growth are not compromised as a result.

Abstract: Our research begins with a theoretical critique of the social capital literature, and then focuses on Old Harbor, Alaska. In this remote outpost, mainly populated by Alutiiq people, all entrepreneurs self-identified as Euro-Americans or multi-ethnic, not Alutiiq. Although Alutiiq people have abundant social capital, which they employed for economic purposes, they did not employ their social capital for commercial entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that social capital promotes entrepreneurship only when supportive cultural capital is in place.

Author-Name: Woolley, Jennifer L.
Abstract: Entrepreneurship is a perilous endeavor. Contextual changes, such as nascent technology emergence or new industry creation, can spawn entrepreneurial opportunities; however, these changes do not instantaneously create the resources and structures that new firms need to survive. This study examines the creation and configuration of the contextual infrastructure necessary for nascent technology entrepreneurship in new industries. Using the case of nanotechnology, I show how the elements of infrastructure emerge and configure through systemic coevolution. The data highlight how boundary crossing and obfuscation induces the configuration of separate elements into a cohesive infrastructure through heightened interaction and interdependence of organizations and institutions, both private and public.

Abstract: We advance and test an institutional anomie theory of opportunity entrepreneurship for understanding the combinative effects of selected cultural values and social institutions to explain national differences in rates of opportunity entrepreneurship. We theorize opportunity entrepreneurship as a creatively deviant response to anomic conditions in societies, i.e., when social institutions block traditional means of achievement. Using 10 years of data for a pooled time series cross-sectional analysis, we examined a unique mixture of cultural and institutional variables and their interactions as predictors of nation-level opportunity entrepreneurship rates. We found support for most hypotheses showing that specific institutional contexts mitigate or enhance the effects of cultural drivers of opportunity entrepreneurship.

Title: Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, and Institutions: Social and Commercial Entrepreneurship Across Nations
Author-Name: Estrin, Saul
Author-Name: Mickiewicz, Tomasz
Author-Name: Stephan, Ute
Abstract: We model and test the relationship between social and commercial entrepreneurship drawing on social capital theory. We propose that the country prevalence rate of social entrepreneurship is an indicator of constructible nation-level social capital and enhances the likelihood of individual commercial entry. We further posit that both social and commercial entrepreneurial entry is facilitated by certain formal institutions, namely strong property rights and (low) government activism, albeit the latter impacts each of these types of entrepreneurship differently. We apply bivariate discrete choice multilevel modeling to population-representative samples in 47 countries and find support for these hypotheses.

Title: Wham‐O's Offer to Buy Sprig Toys: Selling In or Selling Out?
Author-Name: Sarason, Yolanda
Author-Name: DeTienne, Dawn R.
Author-Name: Bentley, Catherine
Abstract: Sprig Toy's mission was to deliver eco-friendly, battery-free, paint-free, kid-powered toys. The company had seen a meteoric rise since its beginning in 2007. Now, however, the founders were at a crossroads. They needed an immediate influx of capital, and on the table was a purchase offer from Wham-O®. As social entrepreneurs, their decision was not purely financial. They had wanted to start a company that would change both the market (how kids played) and the industry (how toys were manufactured)—but now, they had to make a decision regarding the offer to buy their company, and they worried whether they were “selling out.”

Title: Organizational Social Capital, Formalization, and Internal Knowledge Sharing in Entrepreneurial Orientation Formation
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk
Author-Name: Dimov, Dimo
Author-Name: Thongpapanl, Narongsak (Tek)
Abstract: This study considers the mediating role of internal knowledge sharing in the relationship between two critical aspects of organizational social capital (trust and goal congruence) and entrepreneurial orientation (EO), as well as how this role might be moderated by the firm's level of formalization. It shows that higher levels of internal knowledge sharing relate to stronger EO, and such knowledge sharing in turn results from higher levels of trust and goal congruence. This study further provides a nuanced picture of the role of formalization in this process. The authors discuss both the study's implications and future research directions.

Title: Entrepreneurial Behavior of Academic Scientists: Network and Cognitive Determinants of Commitment to Grant Submissions and Award Outcomes
Author-Name: Haller, Megan K.
Author-Name: Welch, Eric W.
Abstract: We employ the individual-opportunity nexus perspective to conceptualize entrepreneurial commitment of academic scientists as the pursuit and attainment of external grant funding. We develop and test a model of network characteristics and cognitive biases that predict the likelihood that scientists will commit to a grant opportunity and the likelihood of receiving an award. Using data from our national survey of faculty, we find that the illusion of control and overconfidence reduce grant submissions but increase awards. Collaboration network size increases submissions and awards. Strong ties are positively related to submissions and smaller networks of strong, highly capable collaborators receive more awards.

Title: A Signaling Perspective on Partner Selection in Venture Capital Syndicates
Author-Name: Hopp, Christian
Author-Name: Lukas, Christian
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factors impacting partnering decisions in venture capital syndicates using a unique data set of 2,373 venture capitalist (VC) transactions in Germany. We employ a signaling perspective to partner-selection strategies within VC syndicates. By including time-varying information about industry experience and cooperation patterns, we explicitly take into account not only the changing social context for partner selection, but also the dynamic nature of signals sent and received. Our analysis documents that the informativeness of investment experience as a signal depends on the existence and frequency of previous joint deals with the lead VC. Experience becomes a much stronger signal if previous invitations to syndicates are bilateral rather than unilateral. The willingness to invite others to deals signals the ability to reciprocate through one's own deal flow. Moreover, we show how the value of signals erodes over time, that is, information from the previous year carries more informational value than signals from more distant years. In sum, the data reveal that different signals carry weight for lead VCs, and that the frequency of signals sent and the stage of development of the portfolio firm positively moderate the value and relevance of signaling behavior. While early stage investments are mainly characterized by need to diversify and to spread risks, value-added advice is necessary in later rounds, and hence, the strength of the signals sent and received gain in relevance and in value.

Abstract: We develop and examine a framework for the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship in alliances. Our framework regards entrepreneurial opportunity as endogenous, and entrepreneurial firms as heterogeneous. The empirical findings show that partners' knowledge protection, which is regarded as a knowledge filter, can increase knowledge spillovers in an alliance. Moreover, this relationship is contingent on the strength of a focal firm's entrepreneurial orientation and on alliance type (equity joint venture versus nonequity joint venture). Results also reveal that knowledge spillovers in an alliance enhance alliance performance more significantly than they enhance firm performance.

Abstract: In this study we draw on the social network and international entrepreneurship literatures to examine the role of structural and relational embeddedness of international networks in firm internationalization. Based on a sample of 169 small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Czech Republic, we found that firms with chief executive officers who had developed strong and diverse international networks exhibited greater knowledge of foreign markets prior to internationalization. However, contrary to our expectations, no relationship was found between network density and such knowledge. In addition, our findings indicate that foreign market knowledge prior to the first international venture had a positive impact on venture performance.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of negative emotions in the social processes of entrepreneurship. Drawing on a study of Russian entrepreneurs, we develop a model of the emotional effects of social interactions between entrepreneurs and state officials. We found that negative emotions were elicited by these interactions and, in turn, fueled three forms of shame-related corrective appeasement behavior (reactive, anticipatory, and sporadic), which served to corrode entrepreneurial motivation and direct attention and energy away from business growth and development.

Abstract: The amount of research conducted on the topic of international entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) has grown exponentially in recent years, thus inviting an analysis of the scholarly conversations taking place. This paper is a review and commentary on how the construct of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has been leveraged within the international entrepreneurship literature. The possible distinctiveness of the EO and IEO constructs are considered, and the major themes of IEO research are summarized. Several measurement-related issues particularly pertinent to the assessment of EO as a generalizable/universalistic phenomenon are considered. The paper concludes with the identification of research foci whose pursuit promises to advance IEO knowledge along productive paths.

Title: Bureaucratic Systems' Facilitating and Hindering Influence on Social Capital
Author-Name: Saparito, Patrick A.
Author-Name: Coombs, Joseph E.
Abstract: This study demonstrates how banks' bureaucratic systems (i.e., formalization, management continuity, customer orientation) are associated with social capital's relational and cognitive dimensions. We collected survey data from a matched sample of 884 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) executives and 217 bank managers across 22 banks to test hypothesized relationships. Our results showed that formalization is negatively associated with both dimensions of social capital, while management continuity and customer orientation are positively associated with them. These results are a first step in answering calls in the literature to study bureaucratic systems' influence on social capital. Theoretical and future research implications are discussed.

Abstract: Despite an abundance of research on entrepreneurial orientation and various dimensions of firm financial performance, very little is known about the specific influence of proactiveness on performance. In the current research, we explore the role of proactiveness in firms' interaction with the external environment. In particular, we examine the influence of proactiveness in stakeholder–firm power difference. Further, we investigate the extent to which stakeholder–firm power difference affects product safety and quality. Using a sample of 144 Chinese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we found that proactiveness can decrease government– and media–firm power differences. Government–firm power difference reduces product concerns, yet media–firm power difference deteriorates the purported product strengths for Chinese SMEs.

Author-Name: Deeds, David L.
Abstract: Focusing on a firm's signaling of social capital through their alliances, we explore how socially constructed signals convey legitimacy and enable greater initial public offering (IPO) proceeds. We examine the concepts of absolute and relative social capital signals with a sample of 266 biotechnology IPOs from 1980 through 2006. Leveraging a dynamic framework, we uncover that the interpretations of quality signals vary over time and are nonadditive; rather, affiliating with prestigious underwriters limits the positive reward of signaling alliance-based social capital. These relationships vary according to whether social capital is evaluated relative to the industry norms and according to the alliance's vertical position.

Abstract: The deal-making process requires entrepreneurial actors to create and maintain wide networks of weak ties while simultaneously developing stronger collaborative ties that will enable opportunities to be realized. We currently lack an adequate account of how these activities are integrated by deal-makers under conditions of risk and uncertainty. In an empirical study of deal making in early-stage technology ventures, we find that deal-makers rely on different forms of trust in the early and later phases. Based on this study, we develop a process model and propositions on the role of trust in integrating strong and weak ties in deal making.

Title: Networking Behavior and Contracting Relationships Among Entrepreneurs in Business Incubators
Author-Name: Ebbers, Joris J.
Abstract: Many studies focus on the relationship between social networks and performance. I study networking behavior as an antecedent of tie formation among entrepreneurs in business incubators. I distinguish between two types of networking behavior: individual networking orientation or building potentially valuable ties for personal gain, and tertius iungens orientation or facilitating tie formation between others. I find that both types of networking behavior are positively related with the number of business partners to whom entrepreneurs give business assignments. Contrary to expectations, I find no relationship between networking behavior and the number of business partners from whom entrepreneurs receive business assignments.

Abstract: This study examines the differential application of mechanisms that venture capitalists use to mitigate the risks of portfolio company internationalization. We investigate differences in round size, round interval, and round syndication between new ventures that internationalize (with a fraction of revenue from abroad) and solely domestic new ventures, using longitudinal data of 962 investing rounds in 334 venture capital-backed technology companies. While opportunistic internationalizers (ratio of foreign sales to total sales less than 10%) receive less funding per round by smaller syndicates over longer intervals than domestic ventures, higher intensity strategic internationalizers receive their funding in shorter intervals.

In exchange for cash donations, attendees take home the bowl to recall all the empty bowls in the world. Monies raised are donated to community-based organizations working toward food security. The founders subsequently formed the nonprofit Imagine Render and now are considering their succession and future direction.

Abstract: In this study, we seek to understand how four dimensions of national business systems surrounding the corporate headquarters of multinational firms influence corporate technological entrepreneurship (CTE). After controlling for fairly well-established antecedents of corporate technological entrepreneurship at the firm and industry levels, we find that national-level predictors explain considerable variance above and beyond our control variables. Furthermore, we find that various national-level dimensions influence different measures of CTE. Overall, our study points to the remarkably strong role of home institutional context for understanding two types of technological entrepreneurship pursued by relatively large, multinational firms based in 24 different economies.

It finds important areas where the two diverge, implying a possible mismatch between expenditure priorities and political rhetoric. This approach is then extended beyond Sweden to include Poland, Austria, and the Flanders region of Belgium to demonstrate the application of the approach to other countries and regions.

Title: Riding the Practice Waves: Social Resourcing Practices During New Venture Development
Author-Name: Keating, Andrew

Author-Name: McLoughlin, Damien
Abstract: This paper investigates how early venture entrepreneurs engage in socially embedded practices to resource their firm. We contribute to an emerging literature that calls for a shift in perspective from “resource” as an object to “resourcing” as a practice. This shift entails a focus away from whom entrepreneurs know toward how they engage with their venture's social contexts. Through the analysis of an in-depth longitudinal case study of a life-science venture, we show that social resourcing practices are more reminiscent of a creative coping with ambiguous and ever-changing environments over time than of “heroic” strategizing. We explore how entrepreneurs mobilize and creatively combine their social resources at hand, seek resources through engaging with other practice nets, negotiate differences between practice nets, and reflectively adapt their resourcing practices toward emerging resource contexts in ways that we describe as “riding the practice waves” of social resourcing.

Abstract: This study examines how founders can manage changes in their network ties during firm founding. We find that an increase in tie strength is negatively associated with founding activities, whereas an increase in the number of ties is positively associated with founding activities. Furthermore, entrepreneurial intensity mitigates the negative relationship between an increase in tie strength and founding activities; and social competence reinforces the positive relationship between an increase in the number of ties and founding activities. Our study contributes to the social capital literature by theorizing and testing how changes in a founder's network structure can be beneficial to founding activities.

Title: Motives and Outcomes in Family Business Succession Planning
Author-Name: Gilding, Michael

Abstract: The family business succession planning literature routinely assumes two main motives on the part of incumbents: family business continuity across generations and family harmony. The cross-tabulation of these motives produces a typology consisting of four distinct combinations of motives for succession planning. In turn, these combinations suggest four outcomes of succession planning, framed as institutionalization, implosion, imposition, and individualization. The first two outcomes—institutionalization and implosion—are fully elucidated in the literature. The other two—imposition and individualization—are routinely overlooked. The proposed typology highlights the repertoire of motives that inform succession planning, and how they promote distinct succession outcomes.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to extend the existing research on the relationship between eight different types of marketing capability and social enterprise performance. More specifically, we examine third-sector organizations that have transformed their traditional business model to become more business-like social enterprises and how these marketing capabilities influence the success of this transformation in both the UK and Japan. We identify, among other things, that not all marketing capabilities are positively associated with social enterprise performance. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that market-driven organizations must develop all types of marketing capability. We suggest that social entrepreneurs should develop their marketing capabilities selectively according to their specific performance objectives.

Abstract: We examine theory and evidence on agents in private-market entrepreneurial financings. After controlling for the endogenous issuer–agent matching and a whole host of other controls, the empirical findings in this paper indicate that agents attract more investors, broaden the geographic investor and capital base, and increase the percentage of investors and capital from investors that are more vulnerable to the costs of information asymmetry. We also find that more capable agents generally provide more valuable benefits to private entrepreneurial firm financings than less capable agents, and that increasing the number of agents in a financing further increases value to issuing firms.

Abstract: Family ties are an important conduit of resources for entrepreneurs, but both positive and negative outcomes can arise. Building upon a family embeddedness perspective, we develop hypotheses about curvilinear relationships between the proportion of family ties in entrepreneurs' networks and venture growth. We test them on entrepreneurs from China, France, Russia, and the United States. These effects appear to be related to the type of entrepreneurs' social network (business advice, emotional support, and business resources). Our results confirm effects specific to each network: an inverted U-shape for advice and emotional support networks but a U-shape for the business resource network, measuring what proportion of kin in each entrepreneurial network type is valuable to or, conversely, undermines new venture growth.

Abstract: Research surrounding how entrepreneurs identify opportunities focuses on the impact of affective valence on entrepreneurs' cognitive processes. Extending this body of research, we theorize how affective valence and affective activation work together to impact opportunity identification. We emphasize that to understand affective influences, both valence and activation should be included because they each influence active search effort and knowledge integration. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our study and suggest that future research should include more dynamic relationships among affect and entrepreneurial outcomes.

Title: Different Strokes for Different Folks: Entrepreneurial Narratives of Emotion, Cognition, and Making Sense of Business Failure
Author-Name: Byrne, Orla
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: This multiple case study of eight entrepreneurial narratives of failed businesses examines how narratives that express different emotional states (folks) reflect different efforts to make sense of failure experiences (strokes). Our comparisons of the narratives' emotional content (describing emotional states at the time of business failure and presently) revealed some new insights. First, high negative emotions motivate making sense of a loss, while high positive emotions provide cognitive resources to facilitate and motivate making sense of the failure event. Second, emotion-focused coping helped deal with negative emotions. Finally, sensemaking was also facilitated by cognitive strategies that focused attention on the failure event and promoted self-reflection.

Abstract: How does previous entrepreneurial failure influence future entrepreneurship? More specifically, under what conditions do entrepreneurs who rebound from failure do better in the next round? Drawing on the cognitive literature in attribution and motivation, we focus on entrepreneurs' reaction to failure and the growth of their subsequent ventures. Leveraging a survey database of new-venture founders with failure experiences, we investigate how their internal attribution of the cause of failure, their intrinsic motivation to start up another business after failure, and the extent of their failure experiences impact the growth of their subsequent ventures.

Title: Finding Practical Knowledge in Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Kenworthy, Thomas
Author-Name: McMullan, W. Edward
Abstract: Research in the pre-paradigmatic, applied scientific field of entrepreneurship is characterized mainly as exploratory. This article advocates for a considerable shift toward a more effective applied research agenda. An applied research program is proposed based on modifications to a Lakatosian research program. The agenda extends beyond typical calls for more replication work to include a focus on practical outcomes, practical significance, and surprising findings among other things. The intent is to produce substantially more practical knowledge—knowledge that is useful to entrepreneurs, policy makers, educators, and scholars.

Title: Bifurcating Time: How Entrepreneurs Reconcile the Paradoxical Demands of the Job
Author-Name: Miller, Danny
Author-Name: Sardais, Cyrille
Abstract: Entrepreneurs have been portrayed in paradoxically contrasting ways in the literature. On the one hand, they are said to be intrepid optimists who venture forth with great persistence even in the face of considerable uncertainty and multiple failures; on the other hand, they are held to be realists who are quick to acknowledge the negative realities of their initiatives and adapt very quickly. In order to reconcile these contrasting views, this study tracks in real time the frequent confidential communications of an entrepreneur and his closest consultant and partner during the last 6 months of a failing venture. We are able to gain insight into how by adopting a positive “frame” or consistent mindset about the future, the entrepreneur is able to sustain confidence in the face of significant challenge while at the same time acknowledging and reacting to significant problems in the present. We propose that an intrinsic quality of an entrepreneur is this ability to integrate or reconcile these seeming opposites—to manage paradox, largely by bifurcating time—by making temporal distinctions, and we show how that person simultaneously can be optimistic and realistic, and persistent and adaptive.

Abstract: Franchisees' affective organizational commitment refers to the degree to which franchisees experience an emotional attachment to their franchise organization. Using a social exchange theory perspective, this research reports four studies that explore the relationship between franchisee's affective commitment and franchisee outcomes. We found that affective commitment to the franchise organization was positively related to franchisee objective performance (Study 1) and intent to acquire additional units (Study 2), and negatively related to franchisee opportunism (Study 3) and intent to leave the franchise organization, particularly when continuance commitment (i.e., commitment based on the cost associated with membership to the franchise) was low (Study 4). The implications of these findings are discussed.

Title: Do Social Capital Building Strategies Influence the Financing Behavior of Chinese Private Small and Medium‐Sized Enterprises?
Author-Name: Du, Jun

Author-Name: Newman, Alexander
Abstract: Using data from 65,485 Chinese private small and medium-sized enterprises over the period 2000–2006, we examine the extent to which firms can improve access to debt by adopting strategies aimed at building social capital, namely entertaining and gift giving to others in their social network, and obtaining political affiliation. We find that although entertainment and gift-giving expenditure leads to higher levels of total and short-term debt, it does not enable firms to obtain greater long-term debt. In contrast, we demonstrate that obtaining political affiliation allows firms greater access to long-term debt.

Abstract: This study examines the antecedents of different bases of organizational commitment and intention to stay of later-generation family members who are currently working in their family firm. Evidence from 199 Canadian and Swiss firms indicates that when these individuals' identity and career interests are aligned with their family enterprise, they experience affective commitment. Family expectations are associated with normative commitment. Individuals who are concerned about losing inherited financial wealth or who perceive a lack of alternative career paths stay with the family enterprise because of continuance commitment. Finally, individuals driven by desire or obligation exhibit low turnover intentions.

Abstract: Although many studies have assessed the effects of networking and government assistance programs on small business success, little attention has been paid to the opportunities afforded by technology for owner–managers in the same industry to offer “soft” support, such as advice, to one another. Here we examine arts and crafts e-commerce, a context conducive to comparing distinct types of advice and support, and where a great deal of peer assistance is exchanged via formal and informal networks. Survey results from 343 artisan entrepreneurs show that motivational differences influence which types of advice and support they value and which they are most likely to provide to others.

Abstract: The universe of family firms is heterogeneous, and findings gleaned from publicly listed firms may not apply to the ubiquitous, but less frequently studied, privately held family firm (PFF). As PFFs are insulated from capital market pressures, owner-managers have greater latitude in setting strategic goals, which may result in different strategic choices and performance outcomes. By employing meta-analytical techniques on 48 studies conducted in nine countries, we synthesize prior PFF research. We show that PFFs prefer more conservative strategies, but contrary to received wisdom, this risk aversion does not hurt their performance. We conclude with an agenda for future research.

Author-Name: Groot, Koen
Abstract: While sustainable entrepreneurs face market barriers that require them to become politically active, how to accomplish this has not yet been explored. This paper seeks to address this research gap based on an exploratory study of the Dutch clean energy sector. Findings suggest that sustainable entrepreneurs are politically active but pursue these activities using collective action. This raises issues because they face the presence of incumbents in industry associations that seek to thwart their political influence. The paper concludes with propositions about the conditions for sustainable entrepreneurs to realize political access and influence through collective action.

Abstract: This analysis demonstrates the relevance and robustness of the theory of planned behavior in the prediction of business start-up intentions and subsequent behavior based on longitudinal survey data (2011 and 2012; n = 969) from the adult population in Austria and Finland. By doing so, the study addresses two weaknesses in current research: the limited scope of samples used in the majority of prior studies and the scarcity of investigations studying the translation of entrepreneurial intentions into behavior. The paper discusses conceptual and methodological issues related to studying the intention–behavior relationship and outlines avenues for future research.

Title: “Bouncing Back” From a Loss: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Emotions, and Failure Narratives
Author-Name: Wolfe, Marcus T.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: In this study, we explore how failure in the form of the first lost game of the college football season for a team influences specific content within the narratives constructed regarding that loss and how those narratives are associated with subsequent performance. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding sports management, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), emotions, and the use of narratives for sensemaking, we develop and test an EO-related sports management model of failure narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of transcripts from head coaches' press conferences directly following their team's first loss of the season as well as regression analysis, we found that the narrative's EO content has a U-shaped relationship with subsequent (i.e., next game) performance. Additionally, negative emotional content had a similar U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. Finally, positive emotional content exhibited an inverse U-shaped relationship with subsequent performance. We discuss the implications of these results on the literatures regarding EO, emotions, and sports management as well as possible avenues for future research.

Title: Start‐Up Difficulties in Early‐Stage Peripheral Clusters: The Case of IT in an Emerging Economy
Author-Name: Kasabov, Edward
Abstract: This paper studies the link between firm-level predicaments in high-technology start-ups and collective, cluster-level dynamics in early-stage peripheral locations. We investigate, first, the manner in which high-technology start-ups in early stage peripheral clusters accumulate and utilize resources; second, ways in which managers in start-up businesses and public sector officials work around inadequacies in order to move forward clusters composed mostly of high-technology start-ups; and third, the influence of such experiences on the development of clusters. Empirical findings from three IT clusters in Vietnam reveal resource inadequacies, private sector actors' inability to resolve such shortcomings, entrepreneurial passivity, risk aversion, and lack of confidence in governmental initiatives. These findings and the comparison with earlier studies about start-up difficulties in other high-technology peripheral locations form the basis for a theoretical framework of high-technology start-up difficulties in early-stage peripheral clusters.

Title: Internal Corporate Venture Operations Independence and Performance: A Knowledge‐Based Perspective
Author-Name: Garrett, Robert P.
Author-Name: Covin, Jeffrey G.
Abstract: Internal corporate ventures (ICVs) are entrepreneurial initiatives originated within a company and intended from inception as new businesses for the parent. The literature suggests that parent–ICV structural separation positively affects ICV performance. However, the literature also suggests that ICVs can be nurtured within the parent's existing organizational structure. Our model explores ICV operations independence as a knowledge flow impediment affecting ICV performance. Primary data from 145 ICVs suggest that operations independence is not associated with ICV performance, but that parent–venture market familiarity, venture opportunity identification mode, and venture planning autonomy moderate the relationship between operations independence and ICV performance.

Author-Name: Jones, Marian V.
Author-Name: Casulli, Lucrezia
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest that individual experience and reasoning, as applied to new endeavors in internationalization, are concepts with high potential to advance conceptual and empirical research in international entrepreneurship (IE). Experience is known to be important in internationalization, but the logic or reasoning with which it is applied is insufficiently understood. Cognitive, comparison-based reasoning theories explain how individuals draw on experience to make sense of uncertain, novel, and complex situations. Drawing on two such theories, heuristics and analogical reasoning, we delineate the logic of experience and advance speculative propositions on its utility in the context of internationalization research.

Abstract: We explore how social entrepreneurship (SE) research extends the field of international entrepreneurship (IE) to affect global sustainable well-being. Well-being is a multidimensional concept that includes financial, social, and environmental wealth creation. Much of IE research thus far has been based primarily on assumptions of economic opportunity recognition, evaluation, and exploitation. We use the SE perspectives of blended value and international governance to revise the definition, assumptions, and boundaries of IE at the firm and international policy levels. We propose a broader vision for the IE field based on an expanded set of assumptions beyond traditional economic thinking.

Author-Name: Marlow, Susan

Abstract: While there is a substantial body of literature exploring the influence of business incubation upon early stage firms, this debate remains almost entirely gender blind. This article challenges this assumption by adopting a feminist perspective to reveal business incubation as a gendered process shaping the identity work undertaken by women seeking legitimacy as technology venturers. In so doing, we critically evaluate prevailing normative analyses of the business incubation process and entrepreneurial legitimation. To illustrate this argument, we draw upon empirical evidence which reveals technology incubation as a legitimating induction process encouraging women to reproduce masculinized representations of the normative technology entrepreneur.

Abstract: We briefly reflect on the theoretical contributions of the ongoing series of special issues on theories of family enterprise and discuss the contributions of each article and commentary in the current special issue. We observe that the meta-themes—the unique goals, governance, and resources of family firms—are not only primary sources of heterogeneity but key determinants of outcomes such as the continuation of family involvement, firm survival and renewal, and financial performance. We conclude that the importance and interrelationships of goals, governance, and resources suggest that a configuration approach to studying their interactions in family firms might be useful.

Title: Goal Setting in Family Firms: Goal Diversity, Social Interactions, and Collective Commitment to Family‐Centered Goals
Author-Name: Kotlar, Josip
Author-Name: De Massis, Alfredo
Abstract: Goal setting in family firms is very complex due to the interplay between family and business systems. However, this topic is largely overlooked in family business research. In this qualitative study of goals and goal formulation processes among 76 organizational members across 19 family firms, we identify goal diversity as a direct consequence of the overlap between the family, ownership, and business systems. We found that goal diversity is expressed more strongly in the proximity of generational transitions, triggering social interaction processes through which organizational members contrast their goals. Our findings suggest that different types of social interactions lead to different behaviors, with familial social interactions being more effective than professional social interactions in managing goal diversity toward the formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals.

Author-Name: Luthans, Fred
Abstract: Kotlar and De Massis found that membership assortment and the number of organizational members, as well as the imminence of succession, influence goal diversity in family firms. They also showed that goal diversity can be managed and family-centered goals can be stabilized through professional and familial social interactions, driving the formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals (CCFG). Using this research as a point of departure, we propose that CCFG may impact family firm economic and noneconomic performance. Furthermore, we introduce to the family firm literature the organizational psychological capital (OPC), consisting of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism. We also suggest that OPC may be more prevalent in family firms than in nonfamily firms. Moreover, OPC of family firms may play an important role in the link between CCFG and economic as well as noneconomic performance.

Title: Exit Strategies in Family Firms: How Socioemotional Wealth Drives the Threshold of Performance

Author-Name: Chirico, Francesco
Abstract: Although research has shown the ability to exit from both successful and unsuccessful ventures is important to founders, families, firms, industries, and overall economic health, exiting from a family firm can be especially challenging. In this paper, we examine exit strategies in the context of the family firm and the family firm portfolio. Drawing upon threshold theory and the socioemotional wealth perspective, we develop a model that provides guiding theoretical explanations for exit strategies. We address two questions: (1) why do family owners develop specific exit strategies, and (2) how do these strategies differ within family firms and family firm portfolios? In doing so, we contribute to family business, portfolio entrepreneurship, and exit literatures.

Abstract: We investigate factors that influence family business owners' choice between passing ownership within the family or to new external owners. Taking an embeddedness perspective focusing on owner-family structure and involvement, we hypothesize that ownership dispersion, number of potential heirs, multigenerational involvement, and whether the chief executive officer is a family member influence the choice of an internal or external transition of ownership. We build a longitudinal data set from a sample of 3,829 family firms and their ownership transitions. Our theorizing and findings regarding ownership transitions complements the abundant research on management succession and therefore constitutes an important contribution to the literature.

Author-Name: Naldi, Lucia

Author-Name: Gomez‐Mejia, Luis
Abstract: We ask whether choices aimed at preserving socioemotional wealth (SEW) represent an asset or a liability in family-controlled firms. Specifically, we consider one major SEW-preserving mechanism—having as chief executive officer (CEO) a member of the controlling family—and hypothesize that this choice is (1) an asset in business contexts, such as industrial districts, in which tacit rules and social norms are relatively more important, but (2) a potential liability in contexts like stock exchange markets, where formal regulations and transparency principles take center stage. The results from our empirical analysis confirm these hypotheses.

Title: Explaining Performance Differences Between Family Firms With Family and Nonfamily CEOs: It's the Nature of the Tie to the Family That Counts!
Author-Name: Jaskiewicz, Peter
Author-Name: Luchak, Andrew A.
Abstract: Drawing on regulatory focus theory, we advance a microtheory for Naldi, Cennamo, Corbetta, and Gómez-Mejía's findings suggesting that family ties as well as the career aspirations that derive from them trigger relatively higher prevention and relatively lower promotion goal orientations of family when compared with nonfamily chief executive officers (CEOs). Our conceptualization offers an alternative theory for why family firms with family CEOs outperform those with nonfamily CEOs in contexts such as industrial districts where conservation strategies are more valuable, but underperform in contexts such as publicly listed firms where market-driven strategies are more valuable. Our commentary highlights the need for future research to examine variance in the self-regulatory mindsets of family and nonfamily CEOs, and to link these differences to firm strategies and performance.

Abstract: We explore the vexing question of whether family firms are more likely to survive than nonfamily firms, focusing on the role of board composition. Utilizing a unique data set of over 700,000 private family and nonfamily firms in the U.K. during 2007–2010, we find that family firms are significantly less likely to fail than nonfamily firms. We identify the board characteristics associated with survival/failure in all firms and determine that it is these characteristics that are important in explaining the lower failure probability of family firms. We conclude with an agenda for further research on boards and family firm survival.

Abstract: The differences among family firms can be as telling as their overall distinctiveness from other forms of enterprise. In order to advance and condition the arguments of Wilson, Wright, and Scholes, we employ a typology of family firm evolutionary development to illustrate how changes in patterns of family involvement in the business can influence several socioemotional wealth priorities and how these in turn can shape the board composition required to enhance firm survival. We conclude by arguing how public listing and environmental competitive circumstances can condition these relationships.

Title: Familiness and Innovation: Resource Bundling as the Missing Link
Author-Name: Carnes, Christina Matz
Author-Name: Ireland, R. Duane
Abstract: Using resource-based logic, we integrate and extend theory and research on familiness and innovation in family firms. Supporting our efforts to do this is the suggestion that recent mixed results regarding the ability of family firms to innovate are at least partially accounted for by the failure to fully consider the importance of resource bundling processes as a mediator of the relationship between familiness as a unique organizational resource and innovation. Specifically, we suggest that the individual components of the resource bundling process—stabilizing, enriching, and pioneering—each mediate the relationship between familiness and innovation, and that these mediation effects account for at least part of the previously reported inconsistent results. Using theory and by integrating insights about familiness, innovation, and resource bundling, we seek to provide a more complete model of conditions affecting family firms' ability to innovate.

Our larger purpose, however, is to offer a small example of the kind of theory building that we believe will be necessary for family businesses researchers to fully leverage insights from family science.

Author-Name: Pollack, Jeffrey M.
Author-Name: Coy, Anthony E.
Author-Name: Green, Jeffrey D.
Author-Name: Davis, Jody L.
Abstract: Prevailing wisdom across the body of research regarding social ties suggests that quantity matters. However, this logic is less applicable in formal networking groups, which have a bounded (and stable) membership. In such a setting, we argue that the quality of an entrepreneur's relationship with the networking group is what matters. Accordingly, we suggest that the networking group setting is one in which core tenets of the literature need refining. Consistent with our predictions, findings from a sample of 279 entrepreneurs across 25 separate networking groups demonstrated that entrepreneurs' affective commitment to the group mediated the relations among (1) satisfaction with their group, (2) investment in their group, and (3) perceptions of alternatives to their group with the outcome of percentage of revenue generated from the networking group. These data provide insight into the psychological and behavioral antecedents of performance for entrepreneurs in networking groups: entrepreneurs who are more affectively committed to their networking groups are more likely to experience gains in revenue attributed to the group. We discuss the implications of these findings as well as offer multiple directions for future work.

Title: The Accidental Internationalists: A Theory of Born Globals
Author-Name: Hennart, Jean‐François
Abstract: The distinguishing characteristic of international new ventures/born globals (INVs/BGs) is that they have foreign sales from the outset, or very quickly afterward. I argue that this is due to their business model. INVs/BGs sell to spatially dispersed customers distinctive niche products that incur low communication, transportation, and adaptation costs. In contrast to the firms described by the Uppsala model, selling to foreign customers does not require additional time or effort for INVs/BGs. Thus INVs/BGs can be seen as accidental internationalists.

Title: International Entrepreneurship and the Theory of the (Long‐Lived) International Firm: A Capabilities Perspective
Author-Name: Al‐Aali, Abdulrahman
Author-Name: Teece, David J.
Abstract: This paper expands on the Oviatt–McDougall framework of sustainable international ventures. It does so by relating the elements of the framework to existing scholarship on the multinational enterprise (MNE), a category that encompasses foreign direct-invested new ventures (FDINVs). The paper then incorporates entrepreneurship and capabilities into MNE theory and applies them to the FDINV. Strong dynamic capabilities coupled with good strategy work together to generate and sustain superior enterprise performance in fast-moving global environments. The resulting framework is used to revisit key questions in MNE/FDINV research such as the timing and mode of FDI.

Title: Entrepreneurial Opportunities and Poverty Alleviation
Author-Name: Alvarez, Sharon A.
Author-Name: Barney, Jay B.
Abstract: Entrepreneurial activity does not always lead to economic growth. While improvements have been made to human capital, property rights protection, and access to financial capital in abject poverty contexts with the assumption that they will increase entrepreneurial activity, the results have been mixed. More recently, many entrepreneurs interested in poverty alleviation are crossing borders to engage in initiatives aimed at reducing poverty internationally. These efforts have also had mixed results. This paper posits that one reason is that entrepreneurial opportunities and their wealth creation potential vary, and the impact of exploiting these opportunities on economic growth in poverty contexts can also vary. This paper identifies self-employment opportunities, often exploited in abject poverty, that do not lead to sustainable growth solutions. Alternatively, discovery and creation opportunities while difficult to exploit in poverty contexts hold the greatest potential for significant economic impact.

Title: Shouting From the Ivory Tower: A Marketing Approach to Improve Communication of Academic Research to Entrepreneurs
Author-Name: Steffens, Paul R.
Author-Name: Weeks, Clinton S.
Author-Name: Davidsson, Per
Author-Name: Isaak, Lauren
Abstract: Evidence-based practice in entrepreneurship requires effective communication of research findings. We focus on how research synopses can “promote” research to entrepreneurs. Drawing on marketing communications literature, we examine how message characteristics of research synopses affect their appeal. We demonstrate the utility of conjoint analysis in this context and find message length, media richness, and source credibility to have positive influences. We find mixed support for a hypothesized negative influence of jargon, and for our predictions that participants’ involvement with academic research moderates these effects. Exploratory analyses reveal latent classes of entrepreneurs with differing preferences, particularly for message length and jargon.

Title: What Do You Have to Say About That? Performance Events and Narratives' Positive and Negative Emotional Content
Author-Name: Wolfe, Marcus T.
Author-Name: Shepherd, Dean A.
Abstract: The current study explores how the failure of innovative projects and positive organizational performance influence specific content within narratives. Building on theoretical perspectives regarding the sensemaking of failure events and emotions, we develop and test a performance event model of narratives. Using computer-aided text analysis of annual reports, we found that project failure rates have a positive relationship with narratives' negative emotional content. Additionally, narratives' positive emotional content is associated with reduced negative emotional content. Finally, positive organizational performance magnifies the negative association between narratives' positive and negative emotional content. We discuss the implications for these results on the literatures regarding the failure of entrepreneurial projects, narratives, and emotions.

Title: Should Small, Young Technology‐Based Firms Internalize Transactions in Their Internationalization?
Author-Name: Li, Lee

Author-Name: Qian, Zhengming
Abstract: Small, young entrepreneurial firms' governance structure across countries has generated an interesting debate in recent years. That is, should these firms internalize or externalize transactions in their internationalization? Existing studies suggest that there are advantages and disadvantages to both structures, but the findings are mixed. This study explores the factors that determine the governance structure of small, young technology-based entrepreneurial firms (SYTEFs). Evidence collected in this study indicates that choice of governance structure by SYTEFs is determined by a specific set of conditions, specifically, their choice of governance structure depends on their strategic assets, industry dynamism, and business scope.

Title: The RICH Entrepreneur: Using Conservation of Resources Theory in Contexts of Uncertainty
Author-Name: Lanivich, Stephen E.
Abstract: This research was designed to extend the scope and conversation of conservation of resource theory (COR) to contexts of uncertainty, including entrepreneurship. In doing so, the resource-induced coping heuristic (RICH) construct is introduced, developed, and validated. Results from two investigations, involving three samples and a total of 813 participants, indicated strong reliability, and internal validity for the theoretically justified, three-factor measure. Also, results of validity tests show the RICH as a robust predictor of factors pertaining to entrepreneurial success, including financial performance and perceived entrepreneurial success. Practical and academic implications, strengths and limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

Abstract: Theoretical explanations for family firm underinvestment in R&D relative to nonfamily firms remain nascent. We revisit this question using a refinement to the behavioral agency model (BAM)—the mixed gamble—that allows us to examine the socioemotional trade-offs that R&D represents for the family firm and how this differentiates their R&D investment decision from nonfamily firms. We do so in an empirical context where R&D investment is of greatest importance—high-technology industries. Moreover, we examine three contingencies that allow us to explore heterogeneity across family firms in their R&D decisions due to their effect upon the family's socioemotional wealth mixed gamble: institutional investor ownership, related diversification, and performance hazard.

Title: Entrepreneurial Behavior in Organizations: Does Job Design Matter?
Author-Name: Jong, Jeroen P.J.
Author-Name: Parker, Sharon K.

Author-Name: Wu, Chia‐Huei
Abstract: We take a first step to explore how organizational factors influence individual entrepreneurial behavior at work, by investigating the role of job design variables. Drawing on multiple-source survey data of 179 workers in a Dutch research and consultancy organization, we find that entrepreneurial behavior, indicated by innovation, proactivity, and risk-taking items, is a higher order construct. Job autonomy is positively related with entrepreneurial behavior, as well as its innovation and proactivity subdimensions, while job variety is not. This suggests that interventions related to the vertical scope of jobs will promote entrepreneurial behaviors more than horizontal job expansion.

Title: The Impact of Entrepreneur‐CEOs in Microfinance Institutions: A Global Survey
Author-Name: Randøy, Trond
Author-Name: Strøm, R. Øystein
Author-Name: Mersland, Roy
Abstract: Microfinance is a global high-growth industry, in which entrepreneurship is prevalent and substantial. Based on the theoretical argument that microfinance entrepreneur-chief executive officers (CEOs) are “motivated agents” with a unique ability to hire and socialize mission-oriented staff, we hypothesize that these CEOs produce more sustainable microfinance institutions (MFIs) with better social performance and lower costs. This study utilizes data from 295 MFIs in 73 developing countries, assessed between 1998 and 2010. Our empirical evidence suggests that entrepreneur-managed MFIs feature higher social performance, greater financial sustainability, and lower costs.

Title: Founding a Business Inspired by Close Entrepreneurial Ties: Does It Matter for Survival?
Author-Name: de Jong, Jeroen P.J.
Author-Name: Marsili, Orietta
Abstract: Founding a business may be inspired by close entrepreneurial ties, that is, business-owning relatives or friends. We analyze if and when such inspiration is associated with post-entry survival. Drawing on longitudinal data on 942 founders, we find a positive relationship only if founders start by taking over an existing business, or spend considerable time at start-up. Moreover, the impact of close tie inspiration is negative for founders with prior entrepreneurial experience, revealing a dark side to serial entrepreneurship. Our findings show that new firm survival can be better understood by modeling contingency variables.

Title: Determinants of Entrepreneurial Intent: A Meta‐Analytic Test and Integration of Competing Models
Author-Name: Schlaegel, Christopher
Author-Name: Koenig, Michael
Abstract: Increasing interest in the development of entrepreneurial intentions has elevated the importance of theories that predict and explain individuals' propensity to start a firm. The purpose of this study is to meta-analytically test and integrate the theory of planned behavior and the entrepreneurial event model. We summarize the findings of 98 studies (123 samples, n = 114,007) and utilize meta-analytic structural equation modeling to examine the empirical fit of the competing theories and the integrated model. Our results demonstrate support for the competing theories and indicate the moderating role of contextual boundary conditions in the development of entrepreneurial intent. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the integrated model provides additional explanatory power and a fuller understanding of the process through which entrepreneurial intent develops.

Abstract: In this paper, we outline several interesting observations about international entrepreneurship (IE) research through the theoretical lens of effectuation. In doing so, we show how an effectual approach can help resolve four central conflicts and knowledge gaps identified in two recent comprehensive reviews of IE. We then present an illustrative case study from India that provides an intriguing comparison with the most recent modification of the Uppsala model to integrate with effectuation theory. Finally, we offer four provocative possibilities for future research at the intersection of IE and effectuation research.

Title: Entrepreneurial Passion as Mediator of the Self‐Efficacy to Persistence Relationship
Author-Name: Cardon, Melissa S.
Author-Name: Kirk, Colleen P.
Abstract: What makes some entrepreneurs persist in their venture efforts while others quit? Self-efficacy has robustly been found to drive persistence, yet recent work suggests that affect, in particular entrepreneurial passion, may also enhance persistence. We empirically examine the possibility that the long-standing relationship between self-efficacy and persistence might be mediated by entrepreneurial passion. Using data from 129 entrepreneurs, we find that the self-efficacy to persistence relationship is mediated by passion for inventing and for founding but not by passion for developing firms. The passion of entrepreneurs appears to help explain the relationship between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and sustained entrepreneurial action.

Author-Name: Serapio, Manuel G.
Abstract: The purpose of this special issue on international entrepreneurship (IE) is to explore concepts, phenomena, and theories with high potential to advance the field. Rather than identify concepts from the extant IE literature, we took the more novel approach of challenging leading researchers to write about IE-relevant issues through the perceptual lenses of their own, or other scholarly domains. Through this process of cross-fertilization, our intention was to generate new topics and fresh insights, alternative arguments, and constructs. The issue's seven articles enrich concepts and theories for IE; advance complementary, or competing arguments that underpin IE thinking; and open the IE dialogue to issues of current global significance.

Title: The Social and Economic Mission of Social Enterprises: Dimensions, Measurement, Validation, and Relation
Author-Name: Stevens, Robin

Author-Name: Bruneel, Johan
Abstract: Social entrepreneurs have a dominant social mission and generate revenue to ensure financial viability. However, most research treats the extent to which social entrepreneurs actually adhere to social and economic mission as a black box. Performing higher order confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of social enterprises (N∼270), this study identifies dimensions and validates measures for understanding and delineating social and economic missions, and shows how the two constructs relate to each other. The theoretical untangling and the empirical validation of social and economic missions as distinct constructs—and multiple potential constellations of attached relative importance—opens up opportunities for quantitative hypothesis-testing research in social entrepreneurship.

Title: Creating the Future Together: Toward a Framework for Research Synthesis in Entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Burg, Elco
Author-Name: Romme, A. Georges L.
Abstract: To develop a body of evidence-based knowledge on entrepreneurship, findings and contributions from the positivist, narrative, and design research traditions in this area need to be combined. Therefore, a framework for research synthesis in terms of social mechanisms, contextual conditions, and outcome patterns is developed in this paper. Subsequently, a synthesis of the existing body of research findings on entrepreneurial opportunities serves to illustrate how this framework can be applied and provides results that inform entrepreneurial action. Finally, we discuss how this synthetic approach serves to systematically connect the fragmented landscape of entrepreneurship research, and thus gradually build a cumulative and evidence-based body of knowledge on entrepreneurship.

Author-Name: Hulsink, Willem
Abstract: Most research in evidence-based entrepreneurship builds on quantitative designs, which is unfortunate because qualitative studies provide a unique contribution to the domain of entrepreneurship. They look at distinctive phenomena in their specific time period and context in one way or another, and can help generate and test new theories. We, therefore, suggest using a systematic synthesis of case studies to aggregate the findings of qualitative research. Moreover, as a first step, we developed an example to demonstrate how this approach can advance evidence-based entrepreneurship. Specifically, we synthesized 13 cases to examine how business clusters increase the performance of firms within clusters.

Title: The Relationship Between Entrepreneurship Education and Entrepreneurial Intentions: A Meta‐Analytic Review
Author-Name: Bae, Tae Jun

Author-Name: Fiet, James O.
Abstract: The research on entrepreneurship education–entrepreneurial intentions has yielded mixed results. We meta-analyzed 73 studies with a total sample size of 37,285 individuals and found a significant but a small correlation between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intentions (  r ^  = . 1 4 3 ). This correlation is also greater than that of business education and entrepreneurial intentions. However, after controlling for pre-education entrepreneurial intentions, the relationship between entrepreneurship education and post-education entrepreneurial intentions was not significant. We also analyzed moderators, such as the attributes of entrepreneurship education, students' differences, and cultural values. Our results have implications for entrepreneurship education scholars, program evaluators, and policy makers.

Author-Name: Malmström, Malin

Author-Name: Wincent, Joakim
Abstract: This study shows how the repertory grid methodology can be used to understand entrepreneurs' cognitive construction of business models and evidence of entrepreneurs' differential cognition of high-profit and low-profit business models. We show that entrepreneurs are more cognitively complex and more nuanced in constructing high-profit business models than low-profit business models. Furthermore, although they are perceived as meaningful, low-profit business models are characterized by relatively less clear cognitive constructions. This study suggests that the repertory grid technique may be useful for future research and entrepreneurship practice to understand the entrepreneurial cognition of business models.

Abstract: The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and firm performance is among the best-researched topics in entrepreneurship research. These studies have been conducted in various national contexts. While a first meta-analysis by Rauch et al. finds no significant difference between EO's effects based on the continent in which the firm is based, the present study considers how national cultural and macroeconomic drivers impact the EO–performance relationship. Building upon 177 studies with data from 41 countries, the meta-analysis consolidates this literature stream, contributing to the evidence-based entrepreneurship research.
