Title: Divergence or convergence: a cross‐national comparison of personnel selection practices
Author-Name: Huo, Y. Paul

Author-Name: Napier, Nancy K.
Abstract: Striking a balance between globalization and localization in human resource management (HRM) requires a better understanding of the cross-national differences in terms of both the status quo and the socially desirable HRM practices. With this purpose in mind, we examined the hiring practices in ten different countries or regions using the Best International Human Resource Management Practices Survey (BIHRMPS). Our empirical findings revealed more divergence than convergence in current recruiting practices, but they also suggest that organizations around the world are indeed in the process of converging on ways of recruitment even though the current selection criteria may still be driven by each country's prevalent cultural values. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Dowling, Peter J.
Abstract: This article presents a comparative study of compensation, by exploring nine items which measure pay and benefits practices in ten locations (nine countries and one region). First, similarities and differences in employee compensation are examined. Second, emerging issues for international compensation are identified. Third, gaps are identified between current practice and employee preferences for future compensation. Overall, the results of this study provide some support for previous research, although a number of counterintuitive findings are identified with respect to the ways in which culture might be expected to impact employee preferences for cross-cultural compensation practices. The research suggests several challenges for compensation practice and directions for future research. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Differences in Promotion Stress across Career Stage and Orientation
Author-Name: Carlson, Dawn S.
Author-Name: Rotondo, Denise M.
Abstract: Promotion stress is the experienced feelings of anxiety, concern, or tension with one's career reality in terms of the level one has reached in the organization. This study considers how promotion stress may differ depending on an individual's internal career orientation (balance, high, free, ahead, secure) as well as an individual's external, professional career stage (apprentice, colleague, mentor, sponsor). The results suggest no clear pattern of differences based on internal career orientation; however, there is a clear pattern with regard to external career stage such that as an individual progresses in his/her professional career, promotion stress decreases. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Drost, Ellen A.
Author-Name: Frayne, Colette A.

Author-Name: Geringer, J. Michael
Abstract: This study compares training and development practices within and across nine countries and one region, and addresses whether there are universal training and development practices. After a brief review of the literature on training and development for the countries and region examined, the study identifies country-specific and region-specific training and development practices. The results are descriptive in nature and discussed as benchmarks of current and desired levels of training and development practices within and across countries. While the results do not indicate any universal practices across all countries studied, they do indicate significant similarities in practices within country clusters. The common practices found within these clusters are believed to be influenced by cultural values and industry trends. The study emphasizes the importance of context and provides practitioners with guidelines in designing training and development practices across countries and researchers with insight into future research questions. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Nason, Stephen
Author-Name: Zhu, Cherrie
Author-Name: De Cieri, Helen
Abstract: While performance appraisals are considered important management tools in many countries, their purposes and practices vary significantly between countries. Unfortunately, there is little empirical data on the specific practices of appraisals across countries. The focus of this study is to empirically examine the current purposes of performance appraisals in ten different countries and regions in Asia, North America, and Latin America. The purposes of appraisals studied here include documentation, development, administrative (pay and promotions), and subordinate expression. This paper also examines how the respondents believe the purposes of appraisals should ideally be practiced. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The role of human resource management: an exploratory study of cross‐country variance
Author-Name: Bowen, David E.
Author-Name: Galang, Carmen
Author-Name: Pillai, Rajnandini
Abstract: We explore how the role of Human Resource Management (HRM) varies across countries on two dimensions. One is how the status of HRM departments may vary (e.g., perceptions of its importance and involvement). Second is whether there is cross-country strategic HRM (SHRM) in terms of the conventional contingency approach (linking HRM practices to strategy), as well as a resource-based view of the firm (e.g., developing “organizational capability” as competitive advantage). Results included significant differences in HRM status across countries; significant correlations between status and “organizational capability”; and in Asian countries, a slight tendency for HRM practices to be linked more to a “differentiation” strategy, whereas, in Anglo countries, a strong linkage between HRM practices and “organizational capability.” © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Von Glinow, Mary Ann

Author-Name: Teagarden, Mary B.
Abstract: This article captures the results of the “Best Practices” Project and attempts to identify which IHRM practices are universally embraced in our ten-country/region sample. Here we present a compelling argument for understanding cultural contexts by seeking and establishing derived etics. No longer content with the traditional conduct of cross-cultural research, we challenge “how” we do research, and encourage gatekeepers to broaden their research lenses with multiple embedded contexts—polycontextuality—as they search for answers. We find anomalies, and counterintuitive findings, and through our “gap analysis,” we discovered several universally embraced etics or best practices. We believe we have not only made a significant contribution to research, but, in particular, we offer a solution methodology for conducting globally distributed IHRM research. These findings signal new directions for all deeply involved in managing within and across different cultures. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Rynes, Sara L.
Author-Name: Colbert, Amy E.
Author-Name: Brown, Kenneth G.
Abstract: Five thousand human resource (HR) professionals were surveyed regarding the extent to which they agreed with various HR research findings. Responses from 959 participants suggest that there are large discrepancies between research findings and practitioners' beliefs in some content areas, especially selection. In particular, practitioners place far less faith in intelligence and personality tests as predictors of employee performance than HR research would recommend. Practitioners are somewhat more likely to agree with research findings when they are at higher organizational levels, have SPHR certification, and read the academic literature. Suggestions are made for more effective dissemination of HR research findings. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Internet job hunting: A field study of applicant experiences with on‐line recruiting
Author-Name: Feldman, Daniel C.
Author-Name: Klaas, Brian S.
Abstract: This field study examines the experiences of managers and professionals searching for jobs via the Internet. Results suggest that facility with Internet navigation is significantly associated with the amount of general job searching, particularly for those who want to explore job options initially in private without fear of retribution from supervisors. The data also suggest that managers and professionals are more likely to use the Internet for job hunting when the geographical scope of the job hunt is wide, when a major salary increase is desired, and when both small and large firms are being considered as potential employers. Use of the Internet is perceived as a somewhat less effective job search strategy than personal networking, but far superior to searching for jobs through newspaper ads and “cold calling.” Major issues found to impede the effectiveness of on-line recruiting are the degree and speed of follow-up on-line applications, lack of specific and relevant job descriptions on a company's Web site, concerns about the security of personal information, and difficulty in customizing, formatting, and downloading resumes to companies' specifications. The article concludes with recommendations for improving the effectiveness of on-line recruiting. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: In the trenches at the talent wars: competitive interaction for scarce human resources
Author-Name: Gardner, Timothy M.
Abstract: A number of indicators suggest that the social norms that once deterred labor market competitors from hiring or “poaching” each others' employees are breaking down. This study explores the competitive interaction that results when one firm attempts to hire employees from a competing firm (known as “talent raiding”). Results suggest that attributes of the raiding firm, the targeted firm, and targeted human capital will affect how a targeted firm responds to a talent raid. The study suggests a number of tactics raiding firms can use to avoid retaliation and suggests tactics targeted firms can use to repel would-be talent raiders. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Expatriation and repatriation in MNCs: a taxonomy
Author-Name: Baruch, Yehuda
Author-Name: Altman, Yochanan
Abstract: The challenge of the management of expatriates and repatriates has never been more timely nor urgent: globalization has forced expatriation into the corporate agenda, confronting us with an array of questions on HRM strategy and practice. We propose that a wide range of current thinking and practice may be conveniently grouped into a taxonomy of five organizational options, each advancing a different set of expatriation relationships: Global, Emissary, Peripheral, Professional, and Expedient. A framework outlining the main configurations of these options generates a generic model for expatriation at the organizational level. This forms the principal part of the article, followed by a comprehensive discussion and implications for practice. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Distributive justice and organizational commitment revisited: moderation by layoff in the case of Korean employees
Author-Name: Chang, Eunmi
Abstract: Research supports the conclusion that organizational commitment is affected more by procedural justice than  by distributive justice, and this is especially true in collectivistic societies. The present research examines  the effects of distributive justice on organizational commitment levels of Korean employees under layoff  situations. It focuses on the moderating effects of two layoff variables: layoff experience and layoff  perception. Data were collected from HR managers from 14 companies and 411 employees. It was found that layoff  perception significantly moderated the effect of distributive justice on organizational commitment, while there  was no significant effect found in the case of layoff experience. Additional analyses show that employees  perceive a high level of distributive justice even in the case of layoffs when training on the appraisal methods  are provided. Implications of these findings are included in the discussion. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals,  Inc.

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between a number of organizational characteristics and the decision to outsource HR. Determinants of the outsourcing of four categories of HR are examined: HR generalists activities (e.g., performance appraisal), transactional activities (e.g., payroll), human capital activities (e.g., training), and recruiting and selection. HR executives in 432 organizations provided data on outsourcing levels and organizational characteristics. Reliance on HR outsourcing was associated with idiosyncratic HR practices, strategic HR involvement, positive HR outcomes, promotional opportunities, demand uncertainty, and pay level. As predicted, however, the impact of organizational characteristics varied among the different types of HR activities outsourced. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Today's technology-driven global economy forces job seekers, employees, human resources professionals, and managers to work smarter and faster to take advantage of a changing labor market. A common language for describing job titles and task/competency-based occupational clusters will facilitate crucial information sharing critical to meeting today's HR challenges. The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) captures the current occupational structure, and can be used by the public and private sectors to share information on all types of jobs. This article discusses the development and applications of the new SOC that will help job seekers, employees, human resources professionals, and management. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Today, competencies are used in many facets of human resource management, ranging from individual selection, development, and performance management to organizational strategic planning. By incorporating competencies into job analysis methodologies, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has developed robust competency models that can form the foundation for each of these initiatives. OPM has placed these models into automated systems to ensure access for employees, human resources professionals, and managers. Shared access to the data creates a shared frame of reference and a common language of competencies that have provided the basis for competency applications in public sector agencies. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article demonstrates the strategic role HR can play in the government's efforts to measure its effectiveness. As federal agencies are being held increasingly accountable for their performance, the need for standardized outcome measures to assess results has become critical. The authors describe a balanced-measures approach for the federal government and provide examples of generic, standardized measures for each perspective of the Balanced Scorecard, including key measures for the HR function. The authors also detail the development of one such measure, a generic customer satisfaction survey. The survey was pilot-tested with three HR organizations in the federal government and is being used by agencies to measure satisfaction with internal services including HR. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Best practices in public‐sector human resources: Wisconsin State Government
Author-Name: Lavigna, Robert J.
Abstract: There is widespread agreement that government human resource systems and processes must become more responsive, flexible, and efficient. However, reform remains more a goal than a reality. The Wisconsin Department of Employment Relations, the state government central personnel/HRM office, has aggressively improved the state human resource/civil service system. Improvements include modernizing state civil service laws, delegating decision-making to operating agencies, developing creative ways to assess job applicants, making greater use of technology, expanding recruiting activities, creating more flexibility in compensation, expanding affirmative action efforts, and forging partnerships with public employee labor unions. These reforms have resulted in faster hiring, well-qualified job candidates, a more diverse work force, and better ways to reward and retain talent. The department has implemented these improvements while still preserving fundamental principles of merit, fairness, and openness. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The six businesses and common resource areas have associated outcomes with plans of  action and milestones to document results. Virginia Beach, the largest city in Virginia with a population of  approximately 435,000, received the U.S. Senate Productivity and Quality Award for Virginia in 1999. © 2002  Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Who's in Charge? An Empirical Study of Executive Staffing Practices in Foreign Subsidiaries
Author-Name: Harzing, Anne‐Wil
Abstract: This study investigates executive staffing practices in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations. Grounded in a literature review of the reasons for employing either parent country nationals or host country nationals in top management positions in foreign subsidiaries, a number of factors influencing the choice between these alternatives are identified. Using a combination of an archival and mail survey research method, the influence of each of these factors is empirically tested with a sample of nearly 3000 observations. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The effects of network groups on minority employee turnover intentions
Author-Name: Friedman, Raymond A.
Author-Name: Holtom, Brooks
Abstract: Companies in the United States are concerned with retaining minority employees to maintain or increase the diversity of their workforce. Here we assess the value of one approach companies have used to retain minority employees: “network” groups. Based on data obtained from a large company with extensive network groups, this study compares the turnover intentions of minority employees who have joined one of the company's network groups to those who have not joined one of the company's network groups. The data show that employee network groups can be useful in helping companies retain managerial-level minority employees. Extensive recommendations are provided to help organizations maximize the effectiveness of network groups. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Coyle‐Shapiro, Jacqueline A‐M.

Author-Name: Dunn, Stephen R.
Abstract: The ability of profit sharing to increase organizational performance via positive changes in employee attitudes has yielded mixed results. Drawing on principal agent, expectancy, and organizational justice theories, we assess how perceptions of profit sharing (capacity for individual contribution and organizational reciprocity) alter organizational commitment and trust in management using longitudinal data provided by 141 engineering employees. Favorable perceptions of profit sharing served to increase organizational commitment while only organizational reciprocity predicted trust in management. The relationship between organizational reciprocity and commitment was partially mediated by trust in management. Implications for the design of profit sharing initiatives are noted. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Using extracurricular activity as an indicator of interpersonal skill: Prudent evaluation or recruiting malpractice?
Author-Name: Rubin, Robert S.
Author-Name: Bommer, William H.
Author-Name: Baldwin, Timothy T.
Abstract: There is widespread agreement that success in organizations requires more than high intellect. Thus, college recruiters commonly examine job candidates' extracurricular activities in search of “well-rounded,” emotionally intelligent, and interpersonally skilled students. Intuitively, extracurricular activities seem like valuable student experiences; however, research evidence is sparse, suggesting far more questions than answers. Is participation in extracurricular activity truly linked to interpersonal skill performance? Does leadership experience make a difference? Do extracurricular experiences yield higher skill development? Six hundred eighteen business students and the relationship of their extracurricular involvement to four interpersonal skills were examined. Significant relationships were found and recruitment implications are discussed. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The management of people across cultures: Valuing people differently
Author-Name: Jackson, Terence
Abstract: Ethnocentric and parochial human resource systems have been called into question as obstacles to globalization. This is addressed here by examining the way value is attached to people in organizations across cultures. Western managers and HR practitioners who work with affiliates in non-Western emerging countries should particularly be aware of differences in “locus of human value.” Policies and practices developed in the West along instrumental lines see people primarily as a means to an end. This may be directly opposed to a humanistic view of human value that sees people as having a value in themselves. To provide support for these assumptions, an exploratory study across seven nations was carried out. Its findings indicate potentially important implications for global HRM policies and practices. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Are there concrete examples of how the “soft” HR factors can be made tangible and, what's more, meaningful to the business? In this article we give an answer to this frequently asked question. We show how Deutsche Bank's HR function consistently developed the range of employee surveying instruments to become pivotal to the Group's success. This is part of a wider effort in recent years to achieve a change of direction for the HR function, making it a strategic partner to the business. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Creating a company‐wide, on‐line, performance management system: A case study at TRW Inc.
Author-Name: Neary, D. Bradford
Abstract: When new company leadership took the helm in 2001, TRW sought to create systems that supported what was, in essence, a cultural revolution—a new culture driven by six company-wide “Behaviors.” Impeding this revolution, however, were the countless systems and methods for evaluating and managing the development of TRW's nearly 100,000 employees. The senior Management Committee challenged TRW's human resources function to create a common, on-line, company-wide system that supports performance appraisal, professional development, and succession management. A cross-disciplinary and cross-business team led by the Director of Leadership Development created a uniform Web-based system in four short months. This system is now in place company-wide in 36 countries on five continents. The approach we took and the success we have enjoyed can be replicated by other organizations seeking a uniform and effective way to evaluate and develop employees. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Sanders, Wm. Gerard
Abstract: In recent years, rewarding CEOs with long-term forms of compensation (e.g., stock options, performance plans, restricted stock) has become more popular than using year-end pay adjustments. Surprisingly, there is little empirical evidence to support the benefits of this trend. This study found that the benefits of long-term compensation flowed primarily to CEOs as they received significantly greater levels of total compensation than CEOs in firms that emphasized year-end pay adjustments. Paradoxically, however, firms that emphasized year-end pay adjustments performed significantly better than firms that were heavy users of long-term forms of contingent compensation. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This article summarizes the results and conclusions reached in studies of the relationships between race and gender diversity and business performance carried out in four large firms by a research consortium known as the Diversity Research Network. These researchers were asked by the BOLD Initiative to conduct this research to test arguments regarding the “business case” for diversity. Few positive or negative direct effects of diversity on performance were observed. Instead a number of different aspects of the organizational context and some group processes moderated diversity-performance relationships. This suggests a more nuanced view of the “business case” for diversity may be appropriate. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Boswell, Wendy R.

Author-Name: LePine, Marcie A.
Author-Name: Moynihan, Lisa M.
Abstract: The present research is intended to contribute to the understanding of how job-choice decisions are made and the role of effective and ineffective recruiting practices in that process. The issues are examined by tracking job seekers through the job search and choice process. At multiple points in the process, structured interviews are used to elicit information from the job seekers pertaining to how they are making their decision and what factors play a role. Results provide theoretical and practical insights into the organizational and job attributes important to job choice, as well as how specific recruiting practices may exert a significant influence, positive or negative, on job-choice decisions. For example, our findings reinforced the importance of providing job seekers the opportunity to meet with multiple (and high-level) organizational constituents, impressive site-visit arrangements, and frequent and prompt follow-up. Also, imposing a deadline (i.e., “exploding offer”) showed little effect on job-choice decisions. Recommendations for recruitment practice and continued research are provided. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In this article, we review how time and space relationships are reframing the training and development agenda. As the speed of business moves faster and boundaries become less relevant, we need ways of expanding and choosing how and when learning and development can take place. We need ways to target development on specific business issues and deliver improved performance in less time with reduced cost. We define a learning options framework to help organize, integrate, synthesize, and better fit training and development methodologies to business realities. Specific knowledge, tools, and examples are provided to show how organizations are identifying and choosing among development options. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A meta‐analysis of the non‐monetary effects of employee health management programs
Author-Name: DeGroot, Timothy
Author-Name: Kiker, D. Scott
Abstract: This study was undertaken to review the literature on employee health management programs (EHMPs). We explored the history and characteristics of systematic organizational efforts to improve workforce health and well-being. We believe that a historical perspective provides some insight into the economic, political, and social factors that have influenced the trend toward organizationally sanctioned health-promotion efforts. Further, we investigated the likely effects of these programs on valued-behavioral organizational outcomes such as employee performance, employee satisfaction, absenteeism, and voluntary turnover. Our findings show that voluntary general-focus programs are unrelated to job performance, and voluntary programs are negatively related to absenteeism, but effects on absenteeism wane when the program is not voluntary. Moreover, EHMPs are minimally related to job satisfaction and slightly related to turnover. These results, examining behavioral outcomes of EHMPs, question the ability of EHMPs to provide desired behavioral changes in employees, changes that organizations seek to maximize such as increased performance. Are EHMPs more than just socially acceptable programs that help individuals with health problems? © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Mellor, Steven

Author-Name: Barnes‐Farrell, Janet L.
Author-Name: Rogelberg, Steven G.
Abstract: The authors1 adopted a family resource view of nonwork obligations and examined these obligations' relationships to dimensions of employees' organizational commitment. Complex interactions were found between employees' marital status, number of children, and having relatives nearby as related to the continuance dimension, but not the affective dimension, of commitment. In particular, results were strongest when the focus was on employees' perceptions of whether they would experience a high personal sacrifice if they were to leave their organizations. These findings are discussed in the context of developing family-friendly human resource programs that may help employees feel less “trapped” in organizations. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Is it better to be laid off when a downsizing initiative is announced? We analyze the outcomes experienced by both victims and survivors involved in a major downsizing program, and present a model of downsizing stress. Results indicate that displaced employees, or “victims,” who secure new employment fare better than survivors. The victims in our study perceive higher levels of control, less stress, and fewer negative job strains than continuing workers, or “survivors.” These results lend credence to suggestions that stress and control are critical factors in understanding employee reactions to downsizing. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: When executives influence peers: Does function matter?

Author-Name: McFarlin, Dean B.
Abstract: Executives often spend considerable time and energy trying to influence peers to support new initiatives (e.g., Conger, 1998; Enns, Huff, & Golden, 2001). That said, we know relatively little about how executives actually influence their peers. Using a sample of 132 executives, the present study found that finance executives differed the most from other executives in terms of the influence tactics and contexts used when influencing peers. Human resource executives also differed considerably from their counterparts in operations regarding influence tactics and contexts. Possible explanations, directions for future research, and implications for management are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The relationship between performance appraisal criterion specificity and statistical evidence of discrimination
Author-Name: Hennessey, H. W.
Author-Name: Bernardin, H. John
Abstract: Plaintiffs' expert witnesses in EEO cases involving performance appraisals often claim that adverse impact is a result of the type of rating format used. Their theory is that more specific rating criteria will lead to lessened adverse impact. We tested that theory by comparing data from a simple category-based rating system against data from a standards-based Work Planning and Review appraisal system with over 248,000 performance appraisals of state employees. Using logistic regression and statistical definitions of prima facie discrimination, we found no support for the hypothesis that adverse impact is materially affected by criterion specificity. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Strauss, Judy P.
Author-Name: Connerley, Mary L.
Abstract: This study explores relationships between race, gender, agreeableness, openness to experience, contact, and a measure of attitudes toward diversity—universal-diverse orientation (UDO). UDO consists of three attitudinal components: realistic appreciation (a cognition), comfort with difference (a feeling), and diversity of contact (a behavior). Results suggest that race, agreeableness, and openness relate to UDO attitudes, primarily due to the relationships of these variables with the behavioral component—diversity of contact. Identifying characteristics of tolerant people (e.g., agreeableness) and training managers in skills related to those characteristics may improve contextual performance and make managers better role models within the organizational context. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Workforce management applications are expected to drive the next phase of enterprise-wide applications market growth. But will firms actually benefit from these applications? Horror stories of failed technology implementation efforts abound and hardly inspire confidence. Treating installation of HR technology as a form of innovation, we introduce a model that describes the technology implementation process. The model brings to the fore various issues that merit the attention of academics and practitioners alike. It appears that firms that undertake technology initiatives with a view to enable the HR function to focus more on value-added activities are the ones most likely to realize the full potential of technology. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We use a behavioral perspective to develop a framework to show the relationships among learning-oriented HRM, positive learning attitudes, and a self-renewal organizational climate. Structural equation analysis is applied to empirically test the relationships and the path model suggests that a learning-oriented HRM plays an important role in either directly creating a self-renewal organizational climate or indirectly facilitating positive learning attitudes that foster organizational self-renewal. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: 360‐degree feedback with systematic coaching: Empirical analysis suggests a winning combination
Author-Name: Luthans, Fred
Author-Name: Peterson, Suzanne J.
Abstract: Wanted: High-performance work practices to gain a competitive advantage. An increasingly common answer to this desperate call is 360-degree programs; unfortunately, they have, at best, mixed reviews when empirically assessed. This study found that a way to improve the effectiveness of 360s may be to combine them with coaching focused on enhanced self-awareness and behavioral management. In a small manufacturer, this feedback-coaching resulted in improved manager and employee satisfaction, commitment, intentions to turnover, and at least indirectly, this firm's performance. This feedback-coaching may be a winning combination to help in the competitive battles in today's global economy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Tharp, Charles G.
Abstract: Corporate wrongdoing is damaging investor confidence and tarnishing the credibility of the U.S. business community, guilty and innocent alike. Some misdeeds are clearly criminal, others simply unethical or damaging to reputations. They range from “massaging” numbers (“managed earnings”), which tests the limits of financial prudence, to outright fraud. Caught in the limelight are U.S. corporate giants representing some of the world's best-known brands and most famous CEOs, many only yesterday lionized in the business press.

Title: Redesigning the human resources function at Lafarge
Author-Name: Som, Ashok
Abstract: This article describes the detailed process of redesigning and implementing the human resources (HR) function at Lafarge. The article argues that a well-articulated and integrated approach of (1) recruitment, selection, and induction, (2) retraining and redeployment, (3) a performance appraisal system, (4) a compensation and reward mechanism, and (5) rightsizing and (6) integration is required to be aligned with the overall business strategy of the organization. It also reinforces that the foundation of a value-added HR function is a business strategy that relies on people as a source of competitive advantage. Key challenges for Lafarge in the future include (1) maintaining the change momentum, (2) fast and effective integration of acquired companies and transfer of “best practices,” and (3) attracting and retaining a diverse workforce through their internationalization program. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Different ties for different needs: Recruitment practices of entrepreneurial firms at different developmental phases
Author-Name: Leung, Aegean
Abstract: Entrepreneurial firms face significant challenges in attracting and acquiring needed human resources. That is, in addition to difficulties associated with resource constraints and organization legitimacy, the requirements for “person-organization fit” change substantially as these firms transit from start-up to growth phase. This study examines how entrepreneurial firms tap evolving social network ties in order to address “needs-and-fits” issues across different developmental stages of the firm. The findings go beyond what “strength of weak ties” and “structural hole” theories would suggest, and highlight the persistent use of strong and direct ties across developmental phases. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: McMullen, Patrick R.
Abstract: This study uses a sample of 2,903 small to medium-sized firms to examine the manner in which HR problems vary over the organizational life cycle. We found that a four-stage model was appropriate. Interestingly, firm age did not emerge as a significant indicator of stage—the firms' HR problems varied across stages defined by growth. Training problems were highest in high-growth firms and lowest in low-growth firms; compensation problems were highest in moderate-growth firms and lowest in high-growth firms; and recruiting problems were highest in no-growth firms and lowest in low-growth firms. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The adoption of high‐involvement practices and processes in emergent and developing firms: A descriptive and prescriptive approach
Author-Name: Ciavarella, Mark A.
Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges entrepreneurs face is how to do more with less. More often than not, the solution lies in the human resource component of the venture. As such, it is important that entrepreneurs understand how practices and processes designed to tap the knowledge, skills, and abilities of their employees can lead to greater productivity and performance. This article develops prescriptive arguments to implicate that adoption of involvement practices and processes by entrepreneurs early in the organization's life may extend desired stages such as growth, or may delay or negate unwanted stages such as maturity and decline. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Contingent labor as an enabler of entrepreneurial growth
Author-Name: Cardon, Melissa S.
Abstract: While all firms can benefit from engaging contingent labor, due to the flexibility, real options, and new knowledge these workers may provide, these benefits are compounded in emerging organizations due to their lack of resources, legitimacy, and time to focus on HR issues. By carefully weighing the risks and benefits, and making purposeful and intentional decisions concerning when and what types of contingent labor to utilize, as well as how to manage and integrate them with traditional employees, emerging ventures may experience enhanced growth and productivity. This may be particularly true during their start-up, expansion, and diversification stages of development. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Strategic human capital management in SMEs: An empirical study of entrepreneurial performance
Author-Name: Hayton, James C.
Abstract: How can human resource management (HRM) practices promote entrepreneurial performance in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? This article discusses the association between human capital management (HCM) and other contemporary HRM practices and the ability of SMEs to be entrepreneurial. In a study of 99 SMEs, HRM practices that promote employee discretionary behavior, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning are found to be positively associated with entrepreneurial performance. Two contingencies are also identified for this relationship. First, the use of strategic HCM practices enhances the observed positive association. Second, these relationships are strongest for SMEs operating in high-technology industries. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Trust and its alternatives
Author-Name: Alvarez, Sharon A.

Author-Name: Bosse, Douglas A.
Abstract: Most scholarly work on trust recognizes its importance as part of a nonmarket form of governance in exchanges between firms. However, trust is only one such governance device that can be used; other devices such as reputation, bargaining power, and contracts can also be used to govern exchanges. This article empirically examines the relationships between trust, reputation, bargaining power, and contracts as governance devices in agreements between smaller entrepreneurial firms and larger, more established firms. The findings suggest that while the role of trust is an important one, it may be more effective when combined with other governance devices. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: A decade ago, the Chief Executive Officer of Albert Einstein Healthcare Network (AEHN), anticipating a tumultuous and largely unpredictable period in its industry, undertook to convert this organization from one that was basically stable and complacent to one that was agile, “nimble, and change-hardy”. This case study, while briefly addressing AEHN's approaches to business strategy and organization design, focuses primarily on the human resource strategy that emerged over time to foster the successful attainment of organizational agility. Although exploratory, the study suggests a number of lessons for those who are—or will be—studying or trying to create and sustain this promising new organizational paradigm. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Data were collected on successful and unsuccessful reward initiatives. The initiatives included new and modified base pay, short- and long-term incentive, benefits, and perquisite/lifestyle rewards. Initiative success was measured on seven factors, and ten conditions were measured for initiative success. Follow-up telephone calls to most respondents provided more detail for examples. Analysis suggests that a common set of criteria can be used to judge the success of different kinds of programs. Surprisingly, success in plan design was not a significant explanatory variable in reaching success on any criterion of rewards initiative success. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Johnson, Danny J.
Abstract: Given an increased emphasis on work teams in organizations, it is important to select applicants based on their ability to make contributions to a given work team. This paper proposes that person–group fit should be useful to select applicants for work teams and suggests that effective use of person–group fit will create both more cohesive work units and more effectively functioning work units. It proposes ways to make valid and reliable assessments of person–group fit that could be used to minimize bias in the selection process. Finally, it addresses several implications of using the person–group fit paradigm for human resource management practice. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Transformations often fail to activate the energy of those whose creativity and action are needed to realize fundamental change. In 1991 Lufthansa was almost bankrupt. Today it has become one of the world's most profitable airline companies and a founding member of the STAR ALLIANCE, aspiring to become the world's leading aviation group. Lufthansa has undergone a fundamental ongoing change—its approach relies on people. Core elements of this strategy involve providing space for reflection and dialogue despite the crisis pressure, building networks of change actors and creating durable platforms for emotional mobilization and reflection on action. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: From Partners to Players: Extending the HR Playing Field
Author-Name: Ulrich, Dave
Author-Name: Beatty, Dick
Abstract: HR professionals must always be “becoming” or constantly changing and adapting. For the last decade, many have argued the business partner role as a complement to traditional HR administrative work. We argue in this paper that HR professionals should move beyond partners to become players. HR professionals as players are “in the game, on the field, making a difference” through their HR work. In this article, we suggest that to become players, HR professionals must learn to coach, architect, build, facilitate, lead, and provide a conscience to business leaders. Specific knowledge and tools for each of these roles are described. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Same‐Sex LMX Dyads on Performance Evaluations
Author-Name: Varma, Arup
Author-Name: Stroh, Linda K.
Abstract: Numerous studies have found that supervisors rate women lower than men for similar levels of performance, suggesting that for female employees, performance alone may not be able to guarantee fair ratings. What is not clear is whether this disparity is a function of the gender composition of the supervisor–subordinate dyad or simply a case of male supervisor rating behavior. Based on data from supervisor–subordinate dyads in four organizations, we found that after controlling for performance, both male and female supervisors exhibit a positive bias toward subordinates of the same sex and rate members of the same gender higher. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Members of 12 project teams in five organizations participated in a study that assessed their self-monitoring characteristics and level of satisfaction with their performance appraisal system. Overall, taking part in self-ratings and upward appraisals of team leaders was associated with greater levels of appraisal satisfaction than was participating in peer evaluations. Self-monitoring level was negatively associated with appraisal satisfaction after controlling for level of ratings generated by peers, self, and leader. The paper discusses results, and offers practical implications in light of the social and interpersonal context that surrounds performance evaluation. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Stetz, Thomas A.
Abstract: The use of peer appraisals has been widely acclaimed, but how useful are they really? Student groups made non-anonymous ratings of peer performance on two group tasks, and the ratings contributed to the students' course grades. Groups differentiated very little among peers in their performance ratings. Individuals in non-differentiating groups reported more positive distributive and procedural justice, satisfaction, and turnover intent than did individuals in differentiating groups. In differentiating groups, no differences in attitudes were found between individuals who were differentially rewarded or penalized for their performance. Implications for peer appraisal practice and future research are discussed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Verizon HR has effectively designed and implemented a strategic management system, which is based upon the balanced scorecard model of Dr. David Norton and Dr. Robert Kaplan of Harvard Business School. The HR Balanced Scorecard was conceived with New Economy organizational dynamics in mind. The scorecard uses a broad range of “leading and lagging” indicators—overall strategy, operational processes, customer perceptions, and financials to evaluate the effectiveness of HR initiatives to the bottom line. The HR Balanced Scorecard provides the means to monitor workforce indicators, analyze workforce statistics, diagnose workforce issues, calculate the negative financial impact, prescribe solutions, and track improvements. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Why would managers abandon pay-for-performance plans they initiated with great hopes? Why would employees celebrate this decision? This article explores why managers made their decisions in 12 of 13 pay-for-performance “experiments” at Hewlett-Packard in the mid-1990s. We find that managers thought the costs of these programs to be higher than the benefits. Alternative managerial practices such as effective leadership, clear objectives, coaching, or training were thought a better investment. Despite the undisputed instrumentality of pay-for-performance to motivate, little attention has been given to whether the benefits outweigh the costs or the “fit” of these programs with high-commitment cultures like Hewlett-Packard was at the time. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Twenty-first-century HR is emerging to uniquely combine activities and processes of human resource management (HRM), human resource development (HRD), and organization development (OD)—three fields that “grew up” distinct from each other. Contributing strategically to organizations demands that HRM, HRD, and OD coordinate, partner, and think innovatively about how they relate and how what they do impacts people and organizations. An analysis of the evolutions of these fields helps to explain why the distinctions between them continue to blur and how the similarities among them provide the necessary synergy for HR to be a truly valued organizational partner. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The impact of organizational climate and strategic fit on firm performance
Author-Name: Burton, Richard M.
Author-Name: Lauridsen, Jørgen
Author-Name: Obel, Børge
Abstract: A firm's organizational climate—its degree of trust, morale, conflict, rewards equity, leader credibility, resistance to change, and scapegoating—helps determine its success. Likewise, organizational strategy—the firm's commitment to capital investment, innovation, quality, and the like—has also been found to be an important determinant of firm performance. However, prior work has most often explored the impact of climate and strategy separately, and not in tandem. In our study, we develop a measure of organizational climate comprised of tension, resistance to change, and conflict, and go on to show that at least for some pairings of a firm's climate and its strategy, there is a negative effect on return on assets (ROA). © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Using the job demands‐resources model to predict burnout and performance
Author-Name: Bakker, Arnold B.
Author-Name: Demerouti, Evangelia
Author-Name: Verbeke, Willem
Abstract: The job demands-resources (JD-R) model was used to examine the relationship between job characteristics, burnout, and (other-ratings of) performance (N = 146). We hypothesized that job demands (e.g., work pressure and emotional demands) would be the most important antecedents of the exhaustion component of burnout, which, in turn, would predict in-role performance (hypothesis 1). In contrast, job resources (e.g., autonomy and social support) were hypothesized to be the most important predictors of extra-role performance, through their relationship with the disengagement component of burnout (hypothesis 2). In addition, we predicted that job resources would buffer the relationship between job demands and exhaustion (hypothesis 3), and that exhaustion would be positively related to disengagement (hypothesis 4). The results of structural equation modeling analyses provided strong support for hypotheses 1, 2, and 4, but rejected hypothesis 3. These findings support the JD-R model's claim that job demands and job resources initiate two psychological processes, which eventually affect organizational outcomes. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Perceived fairness of web‐based applicant screening procedures: Weighing the rules of justice and the role of individual differences
Author-Name: Dineen, Brian R.

Author-Name: Wang, Chongwei
Abstract: Four previously established characteristics of procedural justice (consistency, opportunity to perform, reconsideration opportunity, and feedback timeliness) and one additional characteristic (automated versus human decision agent) were manipulated in a policy-capturing design to examine their relative importance in predicting fairness perceptions in a Web-based applicant-screening context. Results showed that all five justice characteristics influenced fairness perceptions and that a hierarchy of importance among the characteristics existed, with consistency weighted most heavily, followed by opportunity to perform. Gender, conscientiousness, and job application experience moderated the effects of several of these characteristics in predicting fairness perceptions. Implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: DeRouin, Renée E.

Author-Name: Salas, Eduardo
Abstract: The widespread availability of the Internet has revolutionized the way organizations train their workforces. With e-learning methods, learning can take place on-demand, and trainees can be given greater control over their learning than ever before. This increased control has the potential to improve training effectiveness. However, the failure of many e-learning programs suggests that organizations would benefit from a set of research-based principles on providing learner control in e-learning. In this article, we offer guidelines for preparing trainees for learner-led instruction, the design of learner-controlled training, and the creation of workplace conditions that facilitate successful learner-led training. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Preparing the HR profession for technology and information work
Author-Name: Hempel, Paul S.
Abstract: Technology and human resource management have broad influences upon each other. Technology not only changes the administration of human resources (HR), which is the domain of e-HR, but also changes organizations and work. HR professionals must be able to adopt technologies that allow the reengineering of the HR function, be prepared to support organizational and work-design changes enabled by technology, and be able to support the proper managerial climate for innovative and knowledge-based organizations. An examination of HR professional degree programs shows that traditional HR education has poorly prepared the HR profession for these challenges. To address this shortfall, HR education must be revised to provide a greater focus on technological issues, and HR educators must acquire the skills needed to teach these courses. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Technology‐assisted supplemental work: Construct definition and a research framework
Author-Name: Fenner, Grant H.
Author-Name: Renn, Robert W.
Abstract: Extending the workday to the home into the night and weekends is nothing new; however, the wide array of technological tools that facilitate an anytime-anywhere connectedness of employees to their employers is a recent phenomenon. Technology-assisted supplemental work (TASW) is the practice of lengthening working time by remaining connected to work, coworkers, supervisors, and other organizational stakeholders from home via advanced digital information technology (i.e., personal and handheld computers, cellular phones, or pagers). Although previous research offers insight into some aspects of this work form (Venkatesh & Vitalari, 1992), we present a new, broader theoretical framework that explains how organizational climate and employee characteristics promote the performance of TASW, and how both perceived usefulness of technology and satisfaction with adopted technology affect the strength of these relationships. We also explain the linkages among TASW and job performance, career success, and work-to-family conflict and incorporate media richness and time and boundary management as moderators of these relationships. We present propositions, offer a general research strategy, and discuss the framework's theoretical and managerial implications. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The current article reports the findings from two qualitative analyses of organizational Web sites drawn from two years of Fortune's list of “Best Companies to Work For.” The results of these analyses provide a snapshot of online employment recruitment practices at two periods in time and supplied data for a classification procedure used to develop an evaluative methodology for assessing the impact of Web sites on job-seeker perceptions. The subsequent analysis provides insight about how the form, content, and function of employment Web sites affect job-seeker employment-pursuit decisions. Trends identified in this research also provide guidance for future research and practice in the area of employment Web-site strategy and design. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: D'Arcy, John
Abstract: Paradoxically, virtual teams are ubiquitous and often successful, contrary to most current communication theories'predictions. Media naturalness theory (Kock, 2001), an evolutionary perspective on communication and its principles of media naturalness, innate schema similarity, and learned schema diversity can be used to understand, study, and manage successful virtual teamwork. In particular, potential problems of trust and leadership in virtual teams are shown to be amenable to solutions rooted explicitly in an evolutionary context. From a media naturalness perspective, geographic distance and technological complexity are secondary to processes of adaptation, as humans remain the most complex and flexible part of the communication system. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The use of an automated employment recruiting and screening system for temporary professional employees: A case study
Author-Name: Buckley, Patrick
Author-Name: Minette, Kathleen
Author-Name: Joy, Dennis
Author-Name: Michaels, Jeff
Abstract: Many human resource systems are presently being modified so they can be administered using various forms of computer technology. These technological advances are being driven primarily by strong demands from human resource professionals for enhancements in speed, effectiveness, and cost containment. This case study presents results obtained by an educational publisher from use of an automated recruiting and screening system. The system allowed for recruiting and the automated administration of professionally developed, job-related questions aimed at deciphering whether an applicant meets the job requirements. The analyses showed conservative savings due to reduced employee turnover, reduced staffing costs, and increased hiring-process efficiencies. These cumulative savings yielded a return on investment of 6.0 to 1, or a return of $6.00 for every $1.00 invested in the program. When these savings were adjusted to reflect increased hiring trends, more pronounced savings were evident. The current system coupled with the addition of planned enhancements should increase future hiring efficiency, employee quality, and resulting financial savings. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: With failure rates of new information technology (IT) systems approaching 50% by some estimates, it is critical to understand more about the processes contributing to success and failure of these initiatives. Research in the IT field focuses on system usage as the primary outcome of interest. This article suggests that system designers and organizational researchers must also consider unintended reactions of users to such systems. We develop a process model based on theories related to organizational sensemaking and socialization to help understand employee reactions to IT systems. Recommendations for future research and system design are provided. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Work‐nonwork conflict and job stress among virtual workers
Author-Name: Raghuram, Sumita
Author-Name: Wiesenfeld, Batia
Abstract: A primary objective of organizational virtual work programs (e.g., providing the option to employees to work from home) is the reduction of employees'work-nonwork conflict and job stress. In this study, we find some preliminary evidence suggesting that virtual work is negatively related to work-nonwork conflict and job stress. We identify the work factors (clarity of appraisal criteria, interpersonal trust, and organizational connectedness) and individual factors (self-efficacy and ability to structure the workday) associated with work-nonwork conflict and find that these associations are moderated by the extent of virtual work. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Closing science‐practice knowledge gaps: Contributions of psychological research to human resource management
Author-Name: Burke, Michael J.

Author-Name: Edwards, Jack E.
Abstract: Evidence of science-practice knowledge gaps among managers (Rynes, Colbert, & Brown, 2002), coupled with major changes occurring in the workplace over the last ten years, suggest the need for human resources practitioners to become as current as possible on how research findings can assist in improving the management of HR. Nine articles in this special issue provide rich information for understanding the contributions of psychological theories and research findings to HR management and, consequently, for closing science-practice knowledge gaps. More specifically, the articles bring together pairs of scientists and practitioners to address science-practice knowledge gaps in the areas of recruiting and selecting workers, managing performance, training and developing individuals, managing groups and teams, compensating employees, leading others, assessing employee attitudes, managing diversity, and managing downsizing. We hope these articles will stimulate and promote a broader perspective concerning the relevance and value of psychological research for improving HR practices and organizational functioning. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article examines the gaps between research and practice in the areas of rater accuracy and goal setting. Prior research has shown that human resource managers may incorrectly believe that training raters to recognize errors will increase rater accuracy and that employee participation in goal setting is more effective than assigning goals. Theory-based research suggests ways to help raters recognize expected performance and enable employees to self-regulate their pursuit of goals. We describe applications of these findings to performance management programs and suggest methods for evaluating their effectiveness once implemented. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Training and development continues to be a valued component in the modern management of human resources. Emerging research shows that investments in human capital, including training, are positively related to organizational performance. However, training professionals still express frustration at not being at the table. In this article, we review recent models and research on training from industrial/organizational psychology and provide new paradigms for planning evaluation and aligning training with business goals. Based on this evidence and personal experience, we offer four guidelines to aid training professionals in planning and evaluating training that demonstrates stronger linkages between training success and organizational performance.© 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The article then discusses specific theoretical and methodological advancements from recent team research that address each knowledge gap. In other words, what does the scientific literature suggest about team composition, training, and task design, and how does the scientific knowledge compare to actual HR practice? The applied implications and implementation issues associated with each of these knowledge gaps are also discussed, using the scientific literature as a foundation for developing specific recommendations. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Leader visioning and adaptability: Bridging the gap between research and practice on developing the ability to manage change
Author-Name: Zaccaro, Stephen J.
Author-Name: Banks, Deanna
Abstract: The construction of organizational vision and the ability to manage the change engendered by visions represent core organizational competencies that foster competitive advantage for organizations. However, while a significant body of conceptual and empirical research studies supports these as core competencies, high numbers of HR professionals are either not aware of this research or still dispute the utility of these skills. In this article, we discuss three gaps between leadership research and practice. The first refers to the value of organizational visions. The second reflects beliefs about the importance of change management skills for HR managers. The final gap concerns the utility of training and development programs that target visioning and change management skills. We discuss some reasons for these gaps between leadership research and HR practices. We also describe some components of visioning, adaptability and managing change, and provide some supportive conceptual and empirical research. We suggest the use of developmental work assignments as a leader development strategy that we believe is most appropriate for growing these core competencies. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Minette, Kathleen A.
Abstract: A majority of human resources professionals appear to believe that employees are likely to overreport the importance of pay in employee surveys. However, research suggests the opposite is actually true. We review evidence showing the discrepancies between what people say and do with respect to pay. We then discuss why pay is likely to be such an important general motivator, as well as a variety of reasons why managers might underestimate its importance. We note that pay is not equally important in all situations or to all individuals, and identify circumstances under which pay is likely to be more (or less) important to employees. We close with recommendations for implementing research findings with respect to pay and suggestions for evaluating pay systems. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article identifies five gaps between research and practice in the area of employment downsizing. Each area includes psychological research findings that should promote better management practices. Two organizations that successfully bridged the gap between research and practice are presented as examples of how to manage strategic and interpersonal processes effectively when there is pressure to downsize employees. One organization did downsize 8,000 employees as a last resort, while the other took creative steps to avoid any employment downsizing. The article concludes with suggestions for enhancing the effectiveness of downsizing efforts even further, and for evaluating the actions taken. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Does supporting employees' career adaptability lead to commitment, turnover, or both?
Author-Name: Ito, Jack K.
Author-Name: Brotheridge, Céleste M.
Abstract: Today, employees are encouraged to become more career-resilient and engage in career development activities to deal with changes in required knowledge, skills, and abilities, and to facilitate their mobility. This study found that participation in decision making (PDM) and autonomy, along with supervisory career support (information, advice, and encouragement), fostered this career adaptability. These practices were also positively associated with commitment and negatively with intentions to leave. However, career adaptability was positively associated with both commitment and intentions to leave, suggesting some unintended consequences for management approaches supporting career adaptability. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employee affective and behavioral reactions to the spatial density of physical work environments
Author-Name: May, Douglas R.
Author-Name: Oldham, Greg R.
Author-Name: Rathert, Cheryl
Abstract: This field study of a medical clinic found that employees in spatially dense work areas (i.e., those with little space available per person) experienced higher levels of perceived crowding, transfer intentions, and tardiness, as well as lower work area satisfaction, than employees in low-density areas. Crowding perceptions explained the relations between spatial density and the measures of work area satisfaction and tardiness. Finally, when employees had high workloads and their jobs required physical movement, spatial density had weaker relations to crowding perceptions and area satisfaction than in other conditions. Implications of these findings for human resource practitioners are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The application of change management theory to HR portal implementation in subsidiaries of multinational corporations
Author-Name: Ruta, Cataldo Dino
Abstract: HR portals are complex information technology (IT) applications that can be accessed by all employees of a given organization. By placing more applications and information online, HR portals reduce the reliance employees have on HR personnel. Given this relational change, from human to computer, the HR portal implementation process must take into account the challenges of both change management and technology acceptance. By integrating change management theories with IT user acceptance models, this article adds to HR's collective knowledge of ways to effectively implement HR portals. In addition, this article describes the cross-national challenges that exist when a global firm attempts to implement an HR portal around the world. Thus, this article will present a model that (1) integrates change management theories and IT user acceptance models and (2) illustrates the ways in which change management plans may need to be adapted to be effective in various subsidiaries. A case study of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) worldwide implementation of their @HP Employee Portal in the Italian subsidiary of HP illustrates the key issues of these theories. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Back to basics: Learning about employee energy and motivation from running on my treadmill
Author-Name: Welbourne, Theresa M.
Author-Name: Andrews, Steven B.
Author-Name: Andrews, Alice O.
Abstract: In an effort to understand how to optimize employee energy at work, we borrow from the sports physiology literature to develop and test several concepts that have now been used in more than 75 large and small organizations (e.g., automobile firms, banks, hospitals, manufacturing, high technology, service businesses, financial services, and more). Our focus on employee energy led us to develop new measures and processes for our research. The resulting studies presented in this article test two hypotheses focusing on the link between employee energy, turnover, job performance, and job satisfaction. Consistent with what we know about athletic performance, we found that energy is an optimization construct and that variation in employee energy at work has detrimental consequences for performance and satisfaction. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: What really works: HR's role in building the 4 + 2 organization and an introduction to the case studies in the HR leadership forum
Author-Name: Joyce, William
Abstract: Leading in HR means building organizations that consistently and predictably outperform their competitors. In order to understand how HR can best contribute to enhancing firm performance, more than 60,000 pages of information from 200 firms in multiple industries over ten years were analyzed. These firms varied in size, and we complemented these broad extensive analyses with focused, in-depth exploration of issues of special interest. Only four foundation practices (focused strategy, execution, performance culture, and fast and flat organization) and four secondary practices (securing talent, committed leadership, industry-transforming innovation, and growth through mergers and partnerships) were found to be necessary to produce extraordinary returns to shareholders. Specifically, success required performing well in all four foundation areas, plus at least two of the secondary areas—we call this the 4 + 2 formula for sustained business success. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managing workforce diversity at IBM: A global HR topic that has arrived
Author-Name: Childs Jr., J. T. (Ted)
Abstract: To be successful, global companies must continue to look toward the future, and CEOs, senior line and HR management, and diversity leaders play a key role in that process. Workforce diversity cannot be delegated; it must be a partnership. Although the HR team plays the key staff role, total delegation from the top, without active involvement, is a recipe for failure. IBM considers diversity a business imperative as fundamental as delivering superior technologies in the marketplace. To ensure that talented people can contribute at the highest possible level, the company insists on a workplace that is free of discrimination and harassment and full of opportunity for all people. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: HR as a strategic partner: Culture change as an American Express case study
Author-Name: Fairbairn, Ursula
Abstract: A corporate culture is the combination of the values and characteristics that define an organization. It influences the way employees relate to each other, to customers, to shareholders, and to business partners. It drives behaviors and unites employees around a shared set of values. Companies with strong, formally articulated values that are focused on the needs of their constituencies have an important advantage over those without such values. American Express recently worked to strengthen its culture and renew its corporate values. I will focus on why this initiative was important, how we reviewed company culture and implemented culture change strategy, and what early results showed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Branding from the inside out at Yahoo!: HR's role as brand builder
Author-Name: Sartain, Libby
Abstract: Every day, thousands of companies spend millions of dollars to build external brand identity and customer loyalty. Branding implies more than just selling a product or service; the best companies create a strong emotional connection between the message and the product. The brand attaches meaning, the lifestyle, the transformation, the potential, the joy, and the fulfillment to the product. Today, competing for employees is as difficult as competing for customers; building employee loyalty is as important as building customer loyalty; and treating employees right is the key to treating shareholders right. Here we discuss what Yahoo! has done to build its strong branding image. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: UPS is the world's largest package delivery company and a leading global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services. One of the company's missions is to maintain a financially sound company, with broad employee ownership, that offers a long-term competitive return to shareowners. This ownership culture is demonstrated through ownership guidelines for managers and supervisors as well as several employee stock programs. The ownership culture is vigorously promoted throughout UPS by a variety of communication channels. Employee ownership is core to the UPS culture, and it translates into a strong work ethic, with employees engaged in growing the business and committed to the company's success. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The new employment relationship versus the mutual investment approach: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Tsui, Anne S.
Author-Name: Wu, Joshua B.
Abstract: With increasing globalization and hypercompetitive markets, most employers have resorted to headcount management to gain flexibility, remain competitive, and ensure survival. A new employment relationship has emerged. The bond between employer and employee no longer is a long-term relationship involving loyalty and commitment, but a contractlike economic exchange. The authors take a closer look at this new employee relationship in the context of the more traditional employer-employee relationship still found in many organizations. The economic value of the new employee relationship may be less attractive than previously perceived. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In organizations not implementing what they know they should be doing based on experience and insight, and in companies not acting on the basis of the best available evidence, one main factor explains the difficulties—the mental models or mind-sets of senior leaders. How they are formed, what they are about, and a multitude of examples that show how those mind-sets can be improved are presented here. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Talentship, talent segmentation, and sustainability: A new HR decision science paradigm for a new strategy definition
Author-Name: Boudreau, John W.
Author-Name: Ramstad, Peter M.
Abstract: Two paradigm shifts are discussed here: talentship and sustainability. First, the traditional service-oriented HR focus must be extended to a “decision science” that enhances decisions about human capital. We call this decision science talentship. It includes talent segmentation, or identifying pivotal talent pools where the quality and/or availability of human capital makes the biggest difference to strategic success. Second, HR and business leaders increasingly define organizational effectiveness beyond traditional financial outcomes to encompass sustainability—achieving success today without compromising the needs of the future. A common strategic human capital decision science can reveal pivotal talent under both traditional and sustainability-based definitions, and thus uncover important insights about the talent implications of the shifting definition of strategic success. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: From business partner to driving business success: The next step in the evolution of HR management
Author-Name: Cascio, Wayne F.
Abstract: In the 1980s, a combination of economic and political factors led to the demand for greater accountability in all functional areas of business, including HR. The massive restructuring of organizations in the 1990s led to the outsourcing of many of HR's basic transactional functions. In order for HR to add value to an organization, it must have several key competencies. “Influence in leadership is all about understanding the business well enough so that what you recommend adds value to the organization,” says one HR vice president. This article shows how this is done through the example of SYSCO Corporation. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: It is nearly unanimous that HR can and should add more value to corporations. The best way to do this is by being a business partner—by directly improving the performance of the business. This can be accomplished by effective talent management, helping with change management, influencing strategy, and a host of other value-added activities that impact effectiveness. But HR does not seem able to position itself as a business partner in many cases. To analyze the problem HR has in transitioning to a new role, think of HR as a business and what products it should offer. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Snell, Scott A.
Abstract: Will HR professionals continue on their journey to be business leaders, with full sway and equal influence in organizational decision making, or will they take the shortcut by sacrificing professional ethics and values for a “seat at the table”? The first challenge refers to value creation. Creating value in a global economy requires HR executives to clearly understand the confluence of economic, social, and technological forces that drive industry competition. The second challenge, value delivery, deals with the pressing need for HR to demonstrate its tangible impact by aligning with and driving the issues critical to the business. Finally, living values asks us to rediscover that we are the guardians of our organizations. We guard and preserve strategic capability, people, and values. These challenges are examined and a model is provided for understanding how the competing demands placed on HR create both organizational and professional conflict. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The authors of each article in this special issue of Human Resource Management offer a personal perspective about the future of HR. In this concluding article, we cull common themes that emerge from these thoughtful syntheses. We have identified eight major trends these observers believe will affect HR in the future. Three themes shape a new reality for HR (what it is), two define the impact of HR (what it means), and three suggest the profile of the future HR professional (who it is). No one can fully characterize the future, but with the help of the authors in this issue, we can begin to envision it. The themes proposed in this article propose that the reality, impact, and professionalism will change as HR evolves. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Bae, Johngseok
Abstract: This article investigates issues of convergence in human resource systems in Taiwan, with reference to the similarities and differences between locally owned companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs). Traditionally, management in Taiwanese companies has been largely influenced by Confucian values and is quite distinct from approaches common to MNCs. However, globalization has engendered significant competitive pressures, coupled with cultural and institutional change within Taiwan. This article provides a theoretical framework for understanding such changes and provides empirical evidence indicating that Taiwanese companies are acting very much like MNCs with regard to the adoption of flexible, highperformance work systems. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examined 62 lateral influence episodes to more fully understand the process used by executives to gain the support of peers for new initiatives. Behavioral complexity theories (cf.

Interestingly, target assessment factors were connected to certain preparation efforts and the use of specific influence tactics. Executives' preparation efforts, however, were not associated with influence tactic use. Implications for HR professionals and directions for research are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Opportunistic hiring and employee fit
Author-Name: Levesque, Laurie L.
Abstract: Most research on selection processes and organizational fit deals with existing, unfilled positions where expectations and tasks are known and measurable. This article instead evaluates the reasons, processes, and implications of opportunistic hiring—hiring employees before their jobs exist. Examples from an exploratory study show how “fit” factors into selection decisions. A typology is offered along the dimensions of whether opportunistic hiring is used to meet immediate or anticipated needs and the extent to which these needs are articulated prior to selection. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Sellers or keepers? Stock retentions in stock option plans
Author-Name: Pendleton, Andrew
Abstract: This article examines stock-holding behaviors among participants in Save As You Earn (SAYE) stock option plans in the United Kingdom. It examines the influences upon the decision to sell or retain stock once options have been exercised, utilizing data from a study of option plan participants in five large U.K. companies. The main findings are that investment portfolios, the reasons for participating in the option plan, and age are important influences on the decision to retain stock. Contrary to expectations, income and risk preferences have little direct influence once other factors are considered. These results have implications for research, corporate practice, and national policy. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Voluntary employee turnover is expensive. Companies that successfully retain the best and brightest employees save money and protect their intellectual capital. Traditional approaches to understanding turnover place accumulated job dissatisfaction as the primary antecedent to voluntary turnover. However, we show that precipitating events, or shocks, more often are the immediate cause of turnover. Using data from more than 1,200 “leavers,” we describe the nature, content, and role of shocks in turnover decisions. We then provide strategies to help organizations manage shocks, and thereby control turnover. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How leveraging human resource capital with its competitive distinctiveness enhances the performance of commercial and public organizations
Author-Name: Carmeli, Abraham
Author-Name: Schaubroeck, John
Abstract: Although scholars agree that complex relationships between organizations' actual human resources (i.e., human capital stock) and means of leveraging these resources may influence performance, little empirical work has tested such propositions directly. We collected two primary data sets from privateand public-sector organizations in Israel. The multiplicative interaction between perceived human resources capital and distinctive value derived from that HR capital was significantly related to various measures of perceived and objective organizational performance. Having higher levels of human resources capital was strongly associated with performance only when top managers perceived that these resources provided distinctive value in terms of being highly valuable, inimitable, rare, and nonsubstitutable. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on strategic human resource management and the resource-based view of competitive advantage, as well as for practical efforts to develop firm-specific human resource capital that is inherently distinctive. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Outsourcing HR as a competitive strategy? A literature review and an assessment of implications

Abstract: HR outsourcing as an organizational strategy has increased substantially over the last decade. However, this trend has attracted little academic attention regarding how outsourcing decisions are made, the manner in which these decisions are implemented, how outsourcing effectiveness is measured, and its impact on organizational performance. In this article, we provide a critical review of the reasons for, the processes involved in, and the perceived effectiveness of HR outsourcing.We investigate the implications of HR outsourcing for the role of the HR function and for the various groups of people affected by this strategy. We argue that organizations should apply both the resource-based view and institutional theory when making outsourcing decisions. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: HR in the small business enterprise: Assessing the impact of PEO utilization
Author-Name: Klaas, Brian S.
Author-Name: Yang, Hyeuksueng
Author-Name: Gainey, Tom
Author-Name: Mcclendon, John A.
Abstract: Within small businesses, organizational leaders are themselves often responsible for the HR function, an area where they typically have limited training and experience. Not surprisingly, small business leaders have raised concerns about the quality of HR programs in their firms and the fact that HR consumes scarce managerial time. While professional employer organizations (PEOs) emerged in response to such concerns, much controversy exists as to whether and how small businesses benefit from PEO utilization. Using a survey of more than 740 small businesses, we examine the relationship between PEO utilization and two key small business outcomes: managerial time required by HR activities and satisfaction with HR outcomes. Our results indicate that firms not using a PEO reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction with HR outcomes than firms that used a PEO for a limited set of transactional services and firms that used a PEO for both transactional and strategic HR services. Among firms using a PEO, satisfaction with HR outcomes was significantly higher among firms that obtained a broader set of transactional and strategic HR services. Firms that used a PEO also reported that HR consumed significantly less managerial time relative to leaders in firms that made no use of a PEO. However, there was no significant difference in the time demanded by HR between firms that used a limited set of transactional services and those that used a broader range of transactional and strategic services. Implications for the role of PEOs and their use within small businesses are discussed. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Varma, Arup
Abstract: This study draws on organizational justice theory to investigate the effects of mandatory employment arbitration on organizational attraction. Specific attention is given to the characteristics of employment arbitration procedures that moderate the adverse effects these programs have on applicants' intentions to continue with the recruitment process. A total of 389 professional and executive MBA students read simulated employment brochures. Making employment arbitration mandatory was found to have a significant negative main effect on applicant attraction. This negative effect was mitigated when procedures afforded employees more due process considerations and when employees were given a just-cause protection in return for giving up their right to sue. Finally, this negative effect was greater among minorities than nonminorities. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Higher knowledge for higher aspirations
Author-Name: Brockbank, Wayne
Author-Name: Ulrich, Dave
Abstract: With escalating expectations and opportunities for HR professionals to add greater value comes the mandate for greater knowledge about the fundamental driving forces of business. Business leaders and employees increasingly assume that HR professionals have foundational knowledge of HR concepts and practices. But to create competitive advantage from that knowledge, HR professionals must be fully versant about external business realities that directly or indirectly influence how to apply that knowledge. We examine four of the most central categories of external business knowledge: advancements in technology, the causes and effects of economic and regulatory turbulence, the dynamics of business globalization, and changes in population demographics. With knowledge about these fundamental business drivers and their supporting data, HR professionals will be more able to make credible and accurate strategic contributions to business discussions and to proactively build more centrally relevant HR practices. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Family‐friendly work practices in Britain: Availability and perceived accessibility

Author-Name: Mumford, Karen A.
Abstract: Using linked data for British workplaces and employees, we find a low base rate of workplace-level availability, and a substantially lower rate of individual-level perceived accessibility, for five family-friendly work practices' parental leave, paid leave, job sharing, subsidized child care, and working at home. Our results demonstrate that statistics on workplace availability drastically overstate the extent to which employees perceive that family-friendly policies are accessible to them personally. British workplaces appear to be responding slowly, and perhaps disingenuously, to pressures to enhance family-friendly work practices. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Autonomy and teamwork in innovative projects
Author-Name: Hoegl, Martin
Author-Name: Parboteeah, Praveen
Abstract: The use of teams that incorporate autonomy in their designs continues to be an important element of many organizations. However, prior research has emphasized projects with mostly routine tasks and has assumed that autonomy resides primarily with a team leader. We investigate how two aspects of team autonomy are related to teamwork quality, a multifaceted indicator of team collaboration (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001). Specifically, we hypothesize that team-external influence over operational project decisions is negatively related to teamwork quality, while team-internal equality of influence over project decisions is positively related to teamwork quality. Testing our hypotheses on responses from 430 team members and team leaders pertaining to 145 software development teams, results support both predictions. Acknowledging the possible benefits of certain types of external influence (e.g., constructive feedback), the findings demonstrate that team-external managers of innovative projects should generally refrain from interfering in team-internal operational decisions. Likewise, the study shows that all team members should share decision authority, recognizing that their contributions to team discussion and decision making may well differ given differences in experience and expertise. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: What determines the resources allocated to an HR department? The antecedents of the size of HR departments within firms and the relationship between HR department size and the role that HR departments perform are issues of theoretical and practical importance. Using large-scale survey data from organizations in Europe and Japan, this article explores the influence of nationality, size, and sector on the comparative ratio of HR specialists in organizations, and on the likely scope and brief of such departments. It also examines the internal organizational characteristics associated with HR department size. In contrast to previous literature on administrative components, we demonstrate that the human resources staff component is affected not only by organizational size but also by sector and national location. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This research tested the role of core employees (CEs) in firm competitiveness. The article defines theoretical relations among the value and uniqueness of CEs' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) and organizational capabilities that define the competitive advantage of the firm; using a sample of Spanish firms with more than 500 employees, it also analyzes empirically whether CEs are associated with organizational efficiency.The HR manager assessed the value and uniqueness of CEs, and a different manager appraised organizational capabilities. We used a formal methodology to test efficiency. A variance analysis indicated a higher organizational capability for firms using the most valuable and unique CEs and data envelopment analysis (DEA) confirmed that such firms had the highest efficiency. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Approaches to career success: An exploration of surreptitious career‐success strategies
Author-Name: Harris, Lloyd C.
Author-Name: Ogbonna, Emmanuel
Abstract: Theorists have forwarded a vast range of career-success determinants, including sociodemographic, social capital, personality, and other behavioral factors. We suggest that existing studies have overconcentrated on the overt behavioral determinants of career success to the detriment of the covert, clandestine, and concealed. Our analysis of two detailed qualitative case studies involving 112 indepth interviews with executives, managers, supervisors, and front-line staff in a large financial services organization and a medium-sized fashionable restaurant group uncovered five main strategies of surreptitious career success.These strategies are obligation creation and exploitation, personal-status enhancement, information acquisition and control, similarity exploitation, and proactive vertical alignment. Our findings indicate that just over 79% of those interviewed (88 of 112) referred to, at some point in their careers, premeditated strategies to enhance their careers that they concealed from coworkers. Consequently, we argue that surreptitious actions are central to employee career-focused activities and fundamental to a more complete understanding of the complexities of career-oriented employee behavior. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Radical HRM innovation and competitive advantage: The Moneyball story
Author-Name: Wolfe, Richard
Author-Name: Wright, Patrick M.
Author-Name: Smart, Dennis L.
Abstract: Moneyball (Lewis, 2003), a New York Times bestseller, is a book about baseball. When read through a broader lens, however, Moneyball is also a book about innovation, resistance to change, competitive advantage, achieving excellence, and, of most relevance here, human resource management. While many would agree that the radical innovation described in Moneyball represents a “new vision of management” in baseball, this article describes how Moneyball lessons might contribute to a “new vision of HRM” in various types of organizations. The focus of the article is on what HR executives and scholars can learn from the Moneyball phenomenon. More specifically, the authors address a number questions related to the Moneyball story that have relevance to successfully implementing HRM innovations; these questions have to do with overcoming resistance to the implementation of radical innovation and how HRM innovation can contribute to sustainable competitive advantage. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In the present study, we investigate several outcome differences among 410 managers who either had or had not implemented layoffs (i.e., handing out warn notices) during one or more years between 2000 and 2003. Using survey data, our findings show that issuing warn notices significantly predicts increased self-reported health problems, seeking treatment for those health problems, sleep problems, feelings of depersonalization, and intent to quit. Emotional exhaustion fully mediates the relationship between issuing warn notices and health problems, depersonalization, and intent to quit, whereas it partially mediates the relationship to seeking treatment and sleep problems. A similar pattern was found for the mediating variable of job security. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are a strong fit with organizations dominated by routine, highly programmed technologies, and tightly regulated operations. However, while these settings are best suited for ERP implementation, they also have the greatest difficulty making use of the knowledge ERP systems generate because of their inherent rigidity, inertia, and resistance to change. This article examines how human resource management practices can help a firm overcome the problems and capitalize on the opportunities that ERP technology presents by facilitating an effective dual-core structure through an emphasis on knowledge management, human capital stewardship, and relationship building. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Why organizations adopt some human resource management practices and reject others: An exploration of rationales
Author-Name: Subramony, Mahesh
Abstract: This article explores reasons why organizations adopt or reject human resource practices. Four theoretical approaches are brought to bear on this issue. According to the economic approach, organizations adopt HR practices that are economically beneficial to them. Similarly, the alignment approach views firms as adopting HR practices if these practices are aligned with strategic objectives. In contrast, the decision-making approach invokes a constrained-ra-tionality model of managerial judgment, and the diffusion approach attributes the adoption/rejection decision to institutional pressures that encourage imitation. Literature in these areas is reviewed and the implications for HR research and practice are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Modeling an HR shared services center: Experience of an MNC in the United Kingdom
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Abstract: An increasing number of large and multinational organizations are moving to shared services models in delivering the human resource function. It is commonly believed that the adoption of an HR shared services model can transform the role of HR by enabling the HR function to be more strategic at the corporate level and more cost-effective at the operational level. However, few academic studies have been carried out to investigate challenges to implementing an HR services center successfully and the impact of adopting an HR shared services model on different groups of employees. Through a case study of a multinational corporation, this article reveals that there remains a significant gap between literature espousing the efficacy and utility of HR shared services and the extent to which the adoption of such a model is successful. The financial and emotional cost of moving to a shared services model can outweigh the tangible cost savings predicted by firms. The idea of separating the HR function into strategic, operational, and administrative components may prove to be too simplistic, although it underpins the initiative of HR shared services. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Organizations are creating virtual teams at an ever-faster rate. Virtual team leaders and members from distant locations work together and communicate with each other using a variety of information technologies. Results from a survey of 440 training and development professionals identify current organizational training practices aimed at preparing leaders and members for virtual team assignments. Comparing organizations with more effective and less effective virtual team training programs allowed us to identify a set of “best practices.” We offer practical guidance regarding the effective use of training to promote high-quality virtual team performance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This change is happening in both growth and mature industries. Several management scholars have taken interest in the reasons why firms adopt proj-ect-based ways of working. However, the effect of project-based organizing on the firm's HRM is a recurrent problem and a challenge to many companies. We develop a framework for the analysis of HRM in project-intensive firms. Based on a study of four companies and the transformation of their organizational structures and processes, we identify four managerial issues and a number of questions that must be addressed to improve HRM in proj-ect-intensive firms. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Setting people up for success: How the Portman Ritz‐Carlton hotel gets the best from its people
Author-Name: Yeung, Arthur
Abstract: In China, where many multinational companies face a constant shortage of talent and high employee turnover, the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel has been able to attract, develop, and retain high-quality talent to deliver excellent customer service and ensure profitable growth. Under the leadership of Mark DeCocinis since 1998, the Portman Ritz-Carlton has not only been named as the “Best Employer in Asia” by Hewitt Associates three consecutive times, but has also rated the highest in employee satisfaction among all of the Ritz-Carlton's 59 hotels worldwide for five consecutive years. How can DeCocinis and his leadership team achieve such remarkable results? In his interview with Arthur Yeung, Mark DeCocinis, general manager of the Port-man Ritz-Carlton and regional vice president, Asia-Pacific, of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, shares his philosophy and practices on talent management in China and elsewhere. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The impact of e‐HR on professional competence in HRM: Implications for the development of HR professionals
Author-Name: Bell, Bradford S.
Author-Name: Lee, Sae‐Won
Author-Name: Yeung, Sarah K.
Abstract: Information technology has been cited as a critical driver of HR's transition from a focus on administrative tasks to a focus on serving as a strategic business partner. This strategic role not only adds a valuable dimension to the HR function, but also changes the competencies that define the success of HR professionals. Interviews were conducted with HR representatives from 19 firms to examine the linkage between electronic human resources (e-HR) and the reshaping of professional competence in HRM. Based on the findings, we draw implications for the development of HR competencies and identify learning strategies that HR professionals can utilize to fulfill their changing roles and responsibilities. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The HR competencies‐HR effectiveness link: A study in Taiwanese high‐tech companies

Author-Name: Wright, Patrick M.
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between HR competencies and HR effectiveness as perceived by line managers and employees within 39 surveyed Taiwanese high-tech firms. The data were collected from multiple constituencies in the form of four targeted surveys, and the analysis was conducted at the firm level. Respondents included 182 high-level executives, 152 HR managers, 320 line managers, and 1,262 employees. Results suggest that in the Taiwanese high-tech context, HR competencies of field expertise and change management are strongly related to HR effectiveness as perceived by line managers and employees, while business knowledge is not. Managerial implications and future research direction are also discussed in the article. This study contributes to a better understanding of HRM competencies and HR effectiveness within an international context. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Commentary on “meeting the competency needs of global leaders: A partnership approach”: An executive coach's perspective
Author-Name: Brownell, Judi
Author-Name: Goldsmith, Marshall
Abstract: This article concludes that common competencies, the fundamental knowledge and skills developed in traditional educational environments, are necessary but insufficient in the preparation of global leaders. Rather, human resource professionals, in partnership with management educators, are best positioned to identify and facilitate global leadership excellence by focusing on the identification and development of key personal characteristics or distinctive competencies. In particular, global leaders must be men and women of sound character. We further propose that “distinctive competencies” are best assessed through experience in the field. Recommendations are offered as to how competency-based leadership development can be designed to address both common and distinctive competencies, with special attention to the individual's character. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The importance of the employee perspective in the competency development of human resource professionals
Author-Name: Graham, Mary E.
Author-Name: Tarbell, Lindsay M.
Abstract: Recent specification of HR competencies has the potential to influence the professional development of all HR practitioners. It is possible, however, to master the competencies and still underperform. This disconnect may occur because current competency work reflects the perspective of top management clients of human resources to the neglect of the employee perspective. In addition, competencies have become linked so tightly to firm outcomes that normative influences in competency development are lost. To think through these issues, we examine the credibility competency for HR professionals (Ulrich & Brockbank, 2005). Focus groups confirm that credibility dimensions vary across stakeholders, with employees emphasizing trust, management emphasizing expertise and effective relationships, and top management emphasizing the achievement of results. We conclude that more broadly defined competencies for HR professionals are necessary. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In the first criterion-related validity study of a complete 360-degree competency assessment process (i.e., where customer data are included), aggregated 360-degree assessment of 428 retail associate store managers on six competencies showed strong validity (.50) in the prediction of assessment center performance. In addition, 360-degree assessments on each of the six competencies were significantly correlated with the criteria. The aggregated 360-degree assessments also demonstrated incremental validity over managerial ratings alone in the prediction of assessment center criteria. Customer (mystery shopper) assessments were also significantly correlated with the assessment center criteria and exhibited incremental validity beyond supervisory assessments. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A competency‐based framework for promoting corporate entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Hayton, James C.
Author-Name: Kelley, Donna J.
Abstract: Corporate entrepreneurship, the discovery and pursuit of new opportunities through innovation and venturing, is an important source of competitive advantage. Corporate entrepreneurship involves a diverse set of activities such as innovation in products and processes; the development of internal and external corporate ventures; and the development of new business models, which require an array of roles, behaviors, and individual competencies. In this article, we define individual competencies and distinguish them from other individual difference constructs. We argue that given the unique requirements of corporate entrepreneurship, a competency-based approach to assessing organizational human capital needs is superior to more traditional job-analytic methods. Drawing on existing literature, we outline a competency framework for supporting corporate entrepreneurship and infer the underlying, measurable knowledge, skills, and abilities that contribute to these competencies. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this framework for the staffing, training and development, and performance-appraisal practices of firms seeking to promote corporate entrepreneurship. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A competence‐based and multidimensional operationalization and measurement of employability
Author-Name: Heijde, Claudia M. Van Der
Author-Name: Van Der Heijden, Beatrice I. J. M.
Abstract: Employability is a critical requirement for enabling both sustained competitive advantage at the firm level and career success at the individual level. We propose a competence-based approach to employability derived from an expansion of the resource-based view of the firm. In this contribution, we present a reliable and valid instrument for measuring employability. This measure is based on a five-dimensional conceptualization of employability, in which occupational expertise is complemented with generic competences. Two sources of raters (employees and their immediate supervisors) are involved in developing and testing the measure. Since the five dimensions of employability explain a significant amount of variance in both objective and subjective career success, the predictive validity of the tool is promising. This instrument facilitates further scientific HRM research and is of practical value in light of job and career assessments, recruitment, staffing, career mobility, and development practices. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The development of strategic human resource professionals at bae systems
Author-Name: Quinn, Ryan W.
Author-Name: Brockbank, Wayne
Abstract: Dynamic trends in the external business environment, in the challenges that companies face, and in the nature of HR itself demand that HR departments develop new capabilities and that HR professionals develop new competencies. This article examines BAE Systems (U.K.) as a detailed case study of a company that understands the demand for greater HR contribution to business value. BAE Systems acted on that understanding by providing a comprehensive HR professional development program to enhance the competencies of its HR professionals in order to encourage better business performance. Pre- and postprogram measures and extensive qualitative interviews about HR's impact on business performance evidences the effectiveness of this comprehensive approach to the development of HR professional competencies. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A situationalist perspective to competency management
Author-Name: Capaldo, Guido
Author-Name: Iandoli, Luca
Author-Name: Zollo, Giuseppe
Abstract: The dominant view in managerial practice assumes that competencies are “universal” constructs whose meaning is independent from any specific context. The “universalist” approach ensures a high degree of efficiency through standardization of competency codebooks. However, the effectiveness of this approach has often been questioned. Overgeneralization makes the description of competencies ambiguous and does not provide HR managers with adequate practical information. An alternative, “situationalist” approach defines competencies as situated, idiosyncratic constructs whose meaning is deeply influenced by organizational culture and by the unique way people make sense of their jobs. We propose a methodological approach to competency management based on a situationalist perspective. Through a field study carried out in a large Italian organization, we discuss the issues relevant to consider when developing competency-management systems though a situationalist approach. In particular, we show that the situationalist approach, by ensuring higher attention to the meaning and to the situated nature of competencies, is more capable of dealing with some of the critical management challenges outlined in the recent literature, such as the demand for more participative approaches and the increasing emphasis on emerging competencies. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Research has shown that high-involvement work practices are positively related to corporate financial performance. However, it is unknown if investors are able to use information on high-involvement practices to predict the performance of specific companies. In this study, we examine earnings forecasts for a sample of Fortune 1000 firms and find professional stock analysts consistently underestimated the earnings of firms that made greater use of high-involvement practices during the 1990s. Based on data collected from newspaper articles and annual reports, we argue that these lower estimates resulted from a lack of information on innovative HR practices. Recommendations to managers for disseminating information on and leveraging highinvolvement HR practices are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Why should an employer hire a former welfare client?What human resource management practices can help employers retain former welfare clients? This study addresses these questions against the backdrop of changes in welfare legislation in the United States that have lessened support to welfare clients and their families and emphasized movement into the workplace. We conducted a large-scale empirical study of the effectiveness of a wide range of HRM practices and found that higher wages, better financial and health benefits, and development opportunities were positively associated with job retention. Unexpectedly, supervisory training had no relationship to retention, and appraising supervisors on providing a supportive and inclusive work environment showed a negative relationship. We provide suggestions to employers for improving the job retention of former welfare recipients along with directions for additional research. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Serving two organizations: Exploring the employment relationship of contracted employees
Author-Name: Coyle‐Shapiro, Jacqueline A‐M

Author-Name: Kessler, Ian
Abstract: Although growth has occurred in contract employment arrangements both in the public and private sectors, scant research has been conducted on the organizations and employees affected by these arrangements.This study examines the employment relationship of long-term contracted employees using a social exchange framework. Specifically, we examine the effects of employee perceptions of organizational support from contracting and client organizations on their (a) affective commitment to each organization and (b) service-oriented citizenship behavior. We also examine whether felt obligation toward each organization mediates this relationship. Our sample consists of 99 long-term contracted employees working for four contracting organizations that provide services to the public on behalf of a municipal government. Results indicate that the antecedents of affective commitment are similar for the client and contracting organization. Employee perceptions of client organizational supportiveness were positively related to felt obligation and commitment to the client organization. Client felt obligation mediated the effects of client perceived organizational support (POS) on the participation dimension of citizenship behavior. Our study provides additional support for the generalizability of social exchange processes to nontraditional employment relationships. Implications for managing long-term contracted employees are discussed. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Empirical research and narrative reports from working managers suggest that employee attitudes can be negatively influenced by organizational downsizing, but the potential impact of downsizing on applicants is not well documented. In this study, we investigate the effect of organizational downsizing on job-seeker attraction to an organization. Respondents were given descriptions of two organizations, coupled with information on workforce reductions in the two organizations. We found that workforce reductions reduced job-seeker attraction. However, companies that downsized but provided assistance and adequate communication to employees were nearly as attractive to applicants as companies that had not downsized. Managerial implications of these results are provided. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Many managers and human resource professionals view the law increasingly as an overly restrictive influence on their ability to manage employees effectively. This article is intended to alert HR professionals to the risk that they are unnecessarily contributing to the impact that legal considerations have on the management of employees as a result of “legal-centric decision making.” We introduce the construct of legal- centric decision making, present a model of the primary factors contributing to legal-centric decision making, provide support for the model from diverse literatures (e.g., behavioral decision making, management, and law), and identify several keys to avoiding legal- centric decision making. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which organizations implement training activities for facilitating the transfer of training before, during, and after training and the relationship between these activities and the transfer of training across organizations.Training professionals from 150 organizations reported that 62%, 44%, and 34% of employees apply training material on the job immediately, six months, and one year after training. In addition, their organizations were significantly more likely to use training activities to facilitate transfer during training than either before or after training. Further, training activities before, during, and after training were significantly related to the transfer of training; however, activities in the work environment before and after training were more strongly related to transfer than activities during training. The practical and research implications of these findings are discussed for improving the transfer of training in organizations. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A performance‐based, minimalist human resource management approach in business schools
Author-Name: Lorange, Peter
Abstract: This article examines the professorial human resource base in academic institutions. More specifically, we focus on professors in business schools. All academic institutions, business schools included, must have top-quality faculty. Their drive for enhancing academic value creation, generating cutting-edge research, leading teaching, and building strong interrelationships with students and executive participants fuels the success of the academic institution. Obviously, the other employees also are important.The administration must be outstanding, along with the research associates, finance staff, marketing team, and the like. Still, in order to contribute to the overall success of the academic institution, these other functions all depend on an outstanding professorial staff—they cannot create success alone. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Like organizations in other sectors, military settings can be appropriately characterized as political arenas.As such, political skill is critical for military leader effectiveness and leader reputation.This article proposes a conceptual model that articulates the roles of political skill, contextual learning, impression management, and adaptation in leader reputation development for military personnel aspiring to leadership positions. Political skill is shaped by mentoring and contextual learning experiences, which, in turn, affect the flexibility needed for making favorable impressions on others, adaptation, and fit. Implications of the proposed model for developing a more informed understanding of leader effectiveness and reputation in the military are discussed, as are directions for future research. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Wecompute a sequential equilibrium for the U.S.Army'sTargeted Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program in whichtheArmy offers a bonus, soldiers with a low cost of serving in an undesirable location accept the bonus and are sent to an undesirable location, and soldiers with a high cost of serving in an undesirable location reenlist but decline the bonus.Wefind that this program benefits both theArmy and soldiers, increases retention, increases the number of soldierswho serve in an undesirable location, and better matches soldiers to assignments.We discuss implications of our model on human resource management practices for theArmy in its administration of the bonus program and its application to other large organizations that set wages through a rules-based mechanism. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: An application of the unfolding model to explain turnover in a sample of military officers
Author-Name: Holt, Daniel T.
Author-Name: Rehg, Michael T.
Author-Name: Lin, Jeffrey H. S.
Author-Name: Miller, Jennifer
Abstract: Questionnaire data from 182Air Force officers who had voluntarily separated from the service were used to test Lee and Mitchell's (1994) unfolding model of voluntary turnover. Specifically, Lee and Mitchell predict five distinct paths to voluntary turnover, explaining the sequence of deliberate and impulsive decisions individuals make as they choose to leave organizations, where individuals interpret an organizational event, assess their relation to the workplace, evaluate options, and enact a response. Results indicate that 47% of the participants followed those five paths. Model modifications were made that reflect the unique nature of military service where members have preexisting plans to leave the service after a defined period or event.These modifications capture an additional 36% to explain 83% of the turnover decisions.The implications of these findings are addressed. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employer branding in the Belgian Army: The importance of instrumental and symbolic beliefs for potential applicants, actual applicants, and military employees
Author-Name: Lievens, Filip
Abstract: This study conceptualizes employer brand as a package of instrumental and symbolic attributes. Using a sample of 955 individuals (429 potential applicants, 392 actual applicants, and 134 military employees), we examine the relative importance of instrumental and symbolic employer brand beliefs across different groups of individuals: potential applicants, actual applicants, and military employees (with less than three years of tenure). Results show that instrumental attributes explain greater variance in theArmy's attractiveness as an employer among actual applicants compared to potential applicants or employees. In all three groups, symbolic trait inferences explain a similar portion of the variance. In addition, in all three groups, symbolic trait inferences explain incremental variance over and above instrumental attributes. Implications for employer branding practices and image audits are discussed. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Human resource integration in the South African military: A view from the trenches
Author-Name: Menon, Sanjay T.
Author-Name: Kotze, Elize
Abstract: Following the dramatic transformation of SouthAfrican civil society in the postapartheid era, the SouthAfrican National Defence Force (SANDF) literally has had to reinvent itself, changing its mission and attempting to integrate diverse personnel into a cohesive whole.The present study examines the success of these efforts through select perceptual measures reflecting the extent of integration.A survey of 2,212 personnel from various units of the SouthAfrican military showed significant differences in empowerment by race and gender. Female personnel reported lower levels of goal internalization, delegated responsibilities, job involvement, and organizational commitment compared to male personnel. BlackAfrican personnel reported lower levels of perceived control, competence, delegated responsibilities, and consultation by superiors while exhibiting higher levels of goal internalization and job involvement than white personnel. Follow-up interviews provided insight into the underlying dynamics of the integration process and potential explanations for the results. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Building strong ethics and promoting positive character development: The influence of HRM at the United States Military Academy at West Point
Author-Name: Offstein, Evan H.
Author-Name: Dufresne, Ronald L.
Abstract: This article details the design and process of ethical and character development at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Based on a series of in-depth interviews coupled with a rigorous analysis of archival data, we challenge the presumption that military character development is a punitive and reactive activity. Rather, our results suggest that West Point uses a deliberate, intimate, and largely developmental approach to fulfill their mission of producing men and women of character who serve in the common defense. In particular, we found that West Point utilizes traditional human resource management functions of recruiting, selection, job rotation, and training to improve their character-development process. In addition to utilizing these traditional human resource functions, West Point also engages in more contemporary and strategic HR practices such as managing communication, promoting organizational learning, organizational design and development, and organizational socialization and culture shaping to enhance the character and integrity of its members. Accordingly, we feel that the West Point character-development approach can be utilized across settings to assist nonmilitary organizations to aspire and reach higher ethical standards. Finally, we argue that in addition to studying the ethics of HR research, scholars can look to understand how organizations can seek ethics through HR research. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Vashdi, Dana R.

Author-Name: Erez, Miriam
Author-Name: Weiss‐Meilik, Ahuva
Abstract: We adopt an action-research approach to examine the applicability of briefing-debriefing sessions—a team-based, reflexive learning model being used in the IsraelAir Force—to the surgical departments of a major, civilian tertiary center in Israel, and explore the potential impact of such a model on the incidence of preventable adverse events in these departments.Taking into account the similarities and differences between the two team contexts (i.e., surgical team and flight crew), we examine potential barriers to the implementation of such a briefing-debriefing technology in the surgical world, discuss the ways in which such barriers have been largely overcome in the particular case examined, and present the model currently being implemented by the surgical departments in our study.Additionally, based on a grounded theory approach, we generate propositions regarding the way in which briefing-debriefing frameworks might enhance the quality-related outcomes of hospital surgical teams.Wepay particular attention to those aspects of the team-based learning model—such as a focus on status-free transparency and systems-based analysis—intended to promote double- as opposed to simply single-loop learning. ©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Jordan, Rita A.
Abstract: We asked two leaders with experience in both military and corporate leadership, Dr. Ervin J. Rokke andWalter F. Ulmer Jr., to describe their perceptions of the differences between these two arenas. Both believe that compared to most corporate entities, the military provides greater opportunities for early leadership, uses participation and feedback to strengthen communications, prioritizes the welfare of subordinates, and emphasizes a foundation of core values.They also note that the transparency of both corporate and military approaches to leadership has led to shared learning and that despite operating in different environments, military and business have much to learn from eachother.©2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Based on the experiences of the armed forces in the United States and Canada, and incorporating insights from interviews recently conducted in the Canadian military, this article discusses lessons learned about moving women into positions of leadership.The masculine nature of the military exposes many barriers facing women elsewhere. First, we discuss the need for a new kind of leader, and then the consequences for organizations ignoring external realities.Third, we discuss innovative research demonstrating that genuine change must go beyond legislation. Finally, the military illustrates some challenges in identifying the best candidates for leadership positions.

Author-Name: Dupré, Kathryne E.
Author-Name: Day, Arla L.
Abstract: To be competitive in today's increasingly complex and rapidly changing envi-ronment, organizations must retain personnel and promote the well-being of employees. We examine the relationship of both support provided to person-nel and job quality with employee health and turnover intentions among a sample of 450 military personnel. Factors involving the supportive manage-ment of personnel (i.e., supervisory support, organizational support, and work-life balance) and factors pertaining to job quality (i.e., work stimulation and job clarity) were indirectly related to health and to turnover intentions through the mediating influence of job satisfaction. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We investigated the impact of job candidate weight (average or overweight) on several job-related ratings following a videotaped mock interview. In ad-dition to weight, we manipulated the race of the applicant, level of job qual-ifications, and type of job (e.g., public or private contact). We also measured the effect of rater race and negative affect on multiple work-relevant ratings. Weight, applicant race, job qualifications, and job type each had a modest but significant impact on ratings of hireability, performance capacity, adapt-ability, and interpersonal skills, in varying combinations. The implications of these results for practice and future research are provided. © 2007 Wiley Pe-riodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Cohen, Debra J.
Abstract: In this study, we examine two competing perspectives regarding the relative use of high-investment human resource (HIHR) systems for core and support employees within establishments. Using data from 420 establishments, we compare a universal perspective suggesting that the level of HIHR exposure core employees receive is always greater than the level of exposure for sup-port employees, with a contingency perspective suggesting that the relative level of exposure for these employee groups is contingent on strategy, HR philosophy, or industry.The results did not provide support for the universal prediction that core employees always receive higher levels of exposure to HIHR systems than support employees within the same establishment. Moreover, while strategy and HR philosophy were positively related to the level of HIHR system use across establishments, they did not influence the relative level of exposure to HIHR systems for core and support employees. Interestingly, however, industry did exert a unique impact such that core em-ployees received significantly greater exposure to HIHR systems than sup-port employees in nonmanufacturing firms.There were no significant differ-ences in exposure for these two groups in manufacturing industries. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Recent research suggests that nonstandard employment relations may be a source of innovation for the firm. In this article, we analyze firms' strategic correlates and perceived benefits from using two types of employment in-termediaries—consulting firms and temporary help agencies—in their core activities. Organizations with an innovation strategy are more likely to use consulting firms in their core activities, while organizations that compete on the basis of low cost are more apt to use temporary help agencies. Moreover, managers say that consulting firms are more likely than temporary help agencies to provide them with special competencies in their core activities. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: To be strategic in the new public sector, HR must remember its operational activities
Author-Name: Teo, Stephen T. T.
Author-Name: Rodwell, John J.
Abstract: This article examines the level of operational and strategic involvement by human resource departments, the influence of HR departments, and the level of strategic integration as predictors of human resource management per-formance. Surveys from 146 senior line managers and HR executives in com-mercialized and noncommercialized public-sector agencies in Australia were the basis of organizational- and individual-level analyses. Results indicate positive relationships between the degree to which operational HR activities are transferred to line managers, HR influence, strategic integration, and the performance of the HRM function. Interestingly, no relationship was found between the level of strategic involvement by HR departments and the per-ceived performance of the function. Analysis of the individual-level data sup-ports the multiple-constituency approach to HRM, with differences in the evaluation of HRM by respondents from different job functions. The study highlights challenges faced by HR practitioners needing to be operational, to be valued strategically. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Organizations around the world are using multisource, or 360-degree, feed-back. Although many HR practitioners embrace it as an important mecha-nism for leadership development, organizations must attend to and address several issues in order to maximize the utility of multisource feedback (MSF). We discuss current research findings and highlight issues for managers to consider both before starting a multisource feedback process and after the feedback is given, plus we review potential outcomes of the process. We also describe lessons learned from an intensive three-year investigation of an MSF implementation in two organizations. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Testing and extending the unfolding model of voluntary turnover to it professionals
Author-Name: Niederman, Fred
Author-Name: Sumner, Mary
Author-Name: Maertz JR., Carl P.
Abstract: This study examines the turnover decision processes of information technology (IT) personnel for the first time. Our theoretical guide for this investigation was the unfolding model of voluntary turnover (Lee & Mitchell, 1994), the preeminent turnover process model. Most of the 124 leavers used three new decision paths that shared the characteristic of including an alternative job search and evaluation; another significant number used the original five theorized paths. In sharp contrast to earlier findings on the unfolding model, the majority of respondents (88%) reported following paths not among the original five theorized paths.This result strongly suggests that IT professionals likely take numerous routes in deciding to leave current employment, most of which involve some search for and consideration of alternative jobs. A general conclusion for human resource managers is to assume that IT professionals are aware of alternative opportunities and to consider early interventions emphasizing the relative benefits of the current job over labor market competitors. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: One size does not fit all: Managing IT employees' employment arrangements
Author-Name: Prasad, Jayesh

Author-Name: Ferratt, Thomas W.
Abstract: As alternative employment arrangements proliferate within the information technology (IT) function, it becomes increasingly important to understand the impact of these arrangements on IT employees. A prevalent notion in the IT literature is that these employees are homogeneous in their work values and that they prefer similar employment arrangements. Given the inefficiency of designing individual employment programs, we advocate a middle ground between the two extremes of individualized employment arrangements and “one size fits all.” We conducted two studies. The first study developed an individual's work values profile as a psychological construct. It used a national sample of IT employees to validate a simple, heuristic procedure that was successful in classifying about 80% of the sample into three work values profiles.The second study demonstrated the use of work values profiles for understanding how employment arrangements differentially influence employee satisfaction. It applied the validated procedure to a single organization in order to demonstrate the general applicability of the procedure and to show that it provides researchers and HR professionals with better insights than the assumption that all IT employees are alike. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Slaughter, Sandra A.

Author-Name: Fong Boh, Wai
Abstract: We examine determinants of IT compensation using archival salary data from 2,251 IT professionals in Singapore. Consistent with human capital theory, we find that professionals in IT jobs requiring more firm-specific human capital are paid more than those in jobs requiring less firm-specific human capital. Moreover, compensation increases with organizational tenure at an increasing rate for professionals in higher firm-specific human capital IT jobs, but at a decreasing rate for those in lower firm-specific human capital IT jobs. Our results reveal firm-specific human capital as a primary determinant of compensation and a moderator of IT compensation-organizational tenure profiles. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The expectation on today's information technology (IT) professionals to remain technically competent constitutes a significant source of stress. We examine how IT professionals experience and cope with the threat of technical obsolescence. Interestingly, not all IT professionals consider technology change a threat to their technical competence; some viewed updating as enjoyable and pursued learning for its own sake. However, most viewed the relentless demand to update their technical skills as stressful and used a variety of coping strategies to address this threat. Using this cognitive approach to technical obsolescence, we describe implications for managerial practice and delineate a direction for future research. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Focus groups with information technology (IT) professionals and interviews with high-performing IT supervisors were content-analyzed to discover best supervisory practices.The focus is on how these best practices address challenges commonly confronted in the IT work environment. Consistent with classic leadership theory, best practices fell into two major categories: task-focused (boundary spanning, performance management, employee involvement, training and development) and person-focused (relationship building, mentoring, stress management, work-family balance) practices. Results demonstrate that while leadership practices effective with other types of professionals also are appropriate for IT professionals, these practices can be tailored to address unique IT demands. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managing work‐life conflict among information technology workers
Author-Name: Messersmith, Jake
Abstract: As organizations continue to emphasize information technology (IT) to help them compete, IT professionals are being asked to overcome a growing list of challenges. This unrelenting emphasis on IT initiatives often results in longer working hours and around-the-clock support, placing IT workers at risk of suffering from work-life conflict. Human resource managers must skillfully manage this issue, with a particular focus on mitigating the consequences associated with work-life conflict. This article provides an analysis of the antecedents to work-life conflict in the IT profession, as well as solutions that organizations may implement to increase the work-life balance of IT professionals. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examined the career transition of senior executives from a strong bureaucratic organization into a dynamic business environment. In surveying retired, flag-rank admirals characterized by the need to start a second career, we found significant support for a career transition model. The retired admirals in this study largely enjoyed a smooth transition into civilian careers. Their traditional career was associated primarily with external success, the contemporary protean career with internal success.

Title: Career success after stigmatizing organizational events
Author-Name: Hamori, Monika
Abstract: This article examines the effect of six types of stigmatizing organizational events on employees' career moves to another employer: criticism of the organization in the media; resignation of key individuals from the organization; downsizing; a drop in net income; lawsuits launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission, competitors, or customers; and lawsuits launched by employees. Stigmatizing events that signal the decline of corporate performance are the most devastating for professional career success. Outsiders, on the other hand, are less sensitive to an organization's involvement in lawsuits launched by public authorities or employees. Stigmatizing events affect the career success of every professional in the organization, irrespective of his or her hierarchical level. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Balancing global and local strategic contexts: Expatriate knowledge transfer, applications, and learning within a transnational organization
Author-Name: Hocking, J. Barry
Author-Name: Brown, Michelle
Author-Name: Harzing, Anne‐Wil
Abstract: We investigate how expatriates contribute to the transnational firm's strategic objectives of global efficiency, national (”local”) responsiveness, and worldwide learning. We focus on expatriate knowledge application and experiential learning achievements, two assignment-based outcomes of potential strategic value to the firm. We assess how the individual's everyday knowledge access and communication activities, measured by frequency and geographic extent, affect these assignment outcomes. Within our case organization, a prototype transnational firm, we find that expatriate knowledge applications result from frequent knowledge access and communication with the corporate headquarters and other global units of the firm. In contrast, their experiential learning derives from frequent access to hostcountry (local) knowledge that subsequently is adapted to the global corporate context. From a practical perspective, we conclude that experiential learning is an invaluable resource for both present and future corporate assignments. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Country‐of‐origin, localization, or dominance effect? An empirical investigation of HRM practices in foreign subsidiaries
Author-Name: Pudelko, Markus
Author-Name: Harzing, Anne‐Wil
Abstract: This article contributes to two recurring and very central debates in the international management literature: the convergence vs. divergence debate and the standardization vs. localization debate. Using a large-scale sample of multinationals headquartered in the United States, Japan, and Germany, as well as subsidiaries of multinationals from these three countries in the two other respective countries, we test the extent to which HRM practices in subsidiaries are characterized by country-of-origin, localization, and dominance effects. Our results show that overall the dominance effect is most important (i.e., subsidiary practices appear to converge to the dominant U.S. practices). Hence, our results lead to the rather surprising conclusion for what might be considered to be the most localized of functions—HRM—that convergence to a worldwide best practices model is clearly present. The lack of country-of-origin effects for Japanese and German multinationals leads us to a conclusion that is of significant theoretical as well as practical relevance. Multinationals might limit the export of country-of-origin practices to their core competences and converge to best practices in other areas. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The relationship between social norm consensus, perceived similarity, and observer reactions to coworker theft
Author-Name: Schmidtke, James M.
Abstract: This research examines observers' reactions to coworker theft in a restaurant chain. This study focuses on the role of social information, such as the social norm consensus regarding the specific type of theft behavior, and on the perceived similarity between the observer and the perpetrator. In general, observers are less likely to label coworkers' behavior as theft when social norm consensus is low and when they perceive the perpetrator as similar to themselves. Also, observers are less likely to report and more likely to imitate the theft behavior of similar coworkers as the amount of consensus regarding the type of theft decreases. Analyses indicate that the relationship between similarity, reporting, and imitation of theft behavior is not mediated by the labeling of an event as theft. Implications for employee theft research and human resource management practice are discussed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Evolution of the study and practice of personality at work
Author-Name: Schneider, Benjamin
Abstract: This article reviews the dynamic evolution of personality research and practice in work organizations from the early 1900s through the present. The article reveals steady-state equilibrium in the world of practice. In contrast, the world of research is shown to be punctuated by rapid changes in conceptual foci, levels of analysis, and methodological approaches, as well as whether or not personality at work is even considered important. Explanations are offered for these trends, including the ways theory and research in the larger world of the study of personality have been reflected in personality research in and on work organizations. The article concludes with some thoughts about revisiting various branches in this evolution and suggestions for the future of personality research and practice in work organizations. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The relationship between HRM avenues of political influence and perceived organizational performance
Author-Name: Sheehan, Cathy

Author-Name: Holland, Peter
Author-Name: Cieri, Helen De
Abstract: This article explores the relationship between the human resource management function's access to avenues of political influence and perceived organizational performance. We examine responses from 441 Australian senior HRM managers who participated in an online survey of a national HRM professional association. Drawing from political influence theory, we develop a model and related hypotheses to investigate the impact of opportunities for the HRM function to manage and control the shared meaning of HRM on perceived organizational performance. Although there was no evidence of a moderating effect of avenues of HRM political influence, CEO support and organizational support for HRM predicted perceived organizational performance. HRM representation on the board of directors appears to serve a symbolic function only. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in response to the identified importance of CEO and organizational support. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A social cognitive interpretation of person‐organization fitting: The maintenance and development of professional technical competency
Author-Name: Wingreen, Stephen C.
Author-Name: Blanton, J. Ellis
Abstract: Information technology professionals must continually align their competencies with new technological innovation and changing organizational technological climates. Existing theory and practice is deficient with respect to dynamic models of person-organization (P-O) fit. Social cognitive theory proposes a rich and well-defined theoretical framework for understanding dynamic, interactive behavioral processes, and so is adopted as a basis for developing a model of P-O fitting focused on the development of professional technical competencies. P-O fitting is so named because it refers to organizational fit as an ongoing process of adaptation. The article begins by reviewing existing literature on P-O fit and social cognitive theory to produce a set of propositions and a theoretical model of P-O fitting as an adaptive, dynamic phenomenon. Applications of the model for both future research and practice are suggested. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How groups learn, continuously
Author-Name: London, Manuel
Author-Name: Sessa, Valerie I.
Abstract: This article examines how groups learn, conditions that affect learning, and interventions to improve the learning process. Adaptive group learning is reacting almost automatically to stimuli to make minor changes in process and outcome. Generative group learning is proactive learning for mastery. Transformative group learning is reconstructing meaning and fundamentally changing the way the group operates. Pressures and opportunities in the environment and group readiness stimulate and support these different types of learning. Group leaders, members, and human resource professionals who facilitate, coach, and provide resources for development can apply this knowledge to diagnose group conditions and encourage continuous learning. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Dealing with celebrity and accountability in the top job
Author-Name: Ranft, Annette L.
Author-Name: Ferris, Gerald R.
Author-Name: Perryman, Alexa A.
Abstract: Today, human resource executives assume prominent leadership roles in their firms and play important roles in the strategy process. Along with the expansion and evolution of the HR function, the responsibilities of coordination, control, and accountability for organizations and their leaders, particularly the CEO, remain. Forming strong relationships with CEOs thus is viewed as one way to encourage HR's prominence in the firm's overall success, particularly its financial health. In recent years, CEOs' presence in the mass media has surged as well, with some CEOs achieving celebrity status. Celebrity status has the potential to increase CEO discretion, decrease CEO accountability, and expand firm resources. As such, achieving celebrity status can affect the relationship between CEOs and HR executives in regard to accountability. In this article, we discuss accountability as a key job demand and address some of the complexities and dynamics of CEO accountability. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Guest editors' introduction growth and globalization: Evolution of human resource management practices in Asia
Author-Name: Yeung, Arthur
Author-Name: Warner, Malcolm
Author-Name: Rowley, Chris
Abstract: In this introductory note, we offer an overview of how human resource management in Asian countries and corporations is evolving in the face of rapid business growth and integration into the global economy and we describe how the articles in this Special Issue contribute to new knowledge and insights regarding key issues, challenges, and evolution in the field of HRM in Asia. Driven by the combined forces of rapid gross domestic product growth in many Asian economies and their further integration into the global business arena, firms in Asia are in constant flux, no matter whether they are developed economies like Japan, Korea, andTaiwan; developing economies like Malaysia andThailand; or transitional economies like China and Vietnam. How will HRM systems in these countries evolve and transform under the combined forces of growth and globalization? We argue that HRM systems in these Asian firms most likely will evolve toward “bounded convergence.” The demands and expectations of the HR function to take on strategic roles (versus administrative roles) and address critical HR issues like attracting and retaining key talent, building talent pipelines, and creating high-performing cultures are greater than ever. We conclude with a high-level summary of the key contribution of the eight articles covered in this Special Issue. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Strategic HRM practices and their impact on company performance in Chinese enterprises
Author-Name: Akhtar, Syed

Abstract: This study examined the factorial validity of strategic human resource management practices and their effects on company performance in a sample of 465 Chinese enterprises. Data were collected through two questionnaire surveys among general managers and HRM directors on product/service performance of their companies and a range of strategic HRM practices. Our findings indicate that a valid set of strategic HRM practices (training, participation, results-oriented appraisals, and internal career opportunities) affect both product/service performance and financial performance. Employment security and job descriptions contribute uniquely to product/service performance, whereas profit sharing contributes uniquely to financial performance. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Institutional antecedents and performance consequences of employment security and career advancement practices: Evidence from the people's republic of China
Author-Name: Gong, Yaping
Author-Name: Chang, Song
Abstract: In this study, we examine the provision of employment security and career advancement opportunities in firms of diverse institutional ownership and the impact of such practices on employee and firm outcomes. The sample included 478 state-owned and non-state-owned firms (i.e., domestic private firms, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and wholly-foreign-owned firms) in the People's Republic of China. We found that the provision of employment security was greater in state-owned than in non-state-owned firms. The provision of career advancement opportunities in domestic private firms and Sino-foreign joint ventures was similar to that in wholly foreign-owned firms, but greater than that in state-owned firms. The provision of career advancement opportunities was positively related to employee organizational commitment, citizenship behaviors, and firm performance. The provision of employment security was positively related to employee organizational commitment, but not to citizenship behaviors or firm performance. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Human resources planning on terrorism and crises in the Asia Pacific region: Cross‐national challenge, reconsideration, and proposition from western experiences
Author-Name: Liou, Dian‐Yan
Author-Name: Lin, Chin‐Huang
Abstract: Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States (2001) and the two bombing events in Bali (2002, 2005), there has been renewed interest in emergency prevention policies in many organizations around the world. Functional terrorism preparedness requires changes in organizational thinking about external environmental threats. This shift in organizational thinking could be led by human resource departments. In order to achieve this goal, HR departments must redefine their role in terms of crisis management, and then four key planning measures for insuring postemergency operations should be observed. Using system dynamics (SD) methodology, this article examines the causes of states in which organizations operate after terrorist attacks. Based on the qualitative analytic approach of causal loops, this article explores the major challenges for HR development prompted by terrorism. Specifically, we focus on changes both to organizational communication and to workforce planning and succession. These activities are a tremendous challenge immediately following a disaster. A functional HR plan must include elements for proactive alertness, the ability to dispatch inventory, evacuation plans, and record preservation coupled with dissemination to employees and explicit employee training and cross-cultural management. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examined strategic human resource management (SHRM) and human resource practices in the People's Republic of China to assess the impact of these practices on firm performance and the employee relations climate. We also tested whether firm ownership moderates the above relationships. Empirical results from a sample of Chinese firms from various industries and regions showed that the levels of adoption of SHRM and HR practices were lower in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than in foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) and privately owned enterprises (POEs). Both SHRM and HR practices were found to have direct and positive effects on financial performance, operational performance, and the employee relations climate. However, the moderating effect of ownership type was significant for financial performance only. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Do race and gender matter in international assignments to/from Asia Pacific? An exploratory study of attitudes among Chinese
Author-Name: Tung, Rosalie L.
Abstract: Based on a survey of EMBA students in China and South Korea, this article examines how two sensitive but potentially salient criteria—race and gender—affect the selection of an executive to head the (a) foreign operations of a U.S. multinational in China and South Korea and (b) newly acquired U.S. operations of a Korean multinational. The results reveal a fairly complex picture of how gender, race, and the interplay of these two factors might affect these decisions. In the Korean sample, competencies mattered more than race and gender in a senior executive appointment to the U.S. operations of Korean multinationals. Also in the Korean sample, race and gender outweighed competencies in assignments to Korea. In the Chinese sample, competencies outweighed race and gender in a senior executive appointment in China. Overall, Koreans had a more positive attitude toward foreign-born Koreans than the Chinese toward foreign-born Chinese for senior executive appointments. Implications for international human resource management and diversity management, both theoretical and applied, are discussed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How do I trust thee? The employee‐organization relationship, supervisory support, and middle manager trust in the organization
Author-Name: Zhang, Ann Yan

Author-Name: Song, Lynda Jiwen
Author-Name: Li, Chaoping
Author-Name: Jia, Liangding
Abstract: Given the assumption that most employers would like to gain the trust of their employees, what would initiate this trust? This study explores the joint role of the employee-organization relationship (EOR) and supervisory support in initiating trust among middle managers. The results from a study of 545 middle managers in China show that both EOR and supervisory support are important in creating trust, with supervisory support having a stronger influence than EOR. Further, supervisors play a synergistic role by accentuating the positive influence of the mutual investment EOR approach and attenuating the negative influence of the quasi-spot contract EOR with the managers. Results reinforce the importance of both formal structure and social processes in cultivating employee trust in the organization. We discuss implications of these findings for future research and human resource management practices. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: New forms of ownership and human resource practices in Vietnam
Author-Name: Zhu, Ying

Author-Name: Benson, John
Abstract: In 1986, the government of Vietnam commenced the move from a centrally planned system to a market-oriented economy with a multisectoral economic structure and a multiownership system.This process, known as Doi Moi, has had a major effect on the economic and social fabric of Vietnam. Although the body of research on this topic has grown, few studies have explored the effect of these economic changes on the internal operations of enterprises. In particular, little is known about the relationship between these new forms of ownership and how enterprises structure their human resource management. This article seeks to explore this relationship through detailed case studies of 32 enterprises covering the range of ownership types.The findings reveal a diversity of human resource management practices, but certain practices are now more prevalent in particular types of enterprises; human resource management remains the overall exception. The article concludes by considering the theoretical and practical implications of these results for economies undergoing transition. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Women and international assignments: Taking stock—a 25‐year review
Author-Name: Altman, Yochanan
Author-Name: Shortland, Susan
Abstract: Women's progress into management and, more specifically, into the world of expatriates, is the subject of this review. Despite advances in equal opportunities legislation, women failed to embark on expatriate missions in significant numbers during the 1980s. In the 1990s, more women were offered international assignment opportunities but they remained a negligible minority compared to men. The first decade of the twenty-first century has witnessed a gradual increase in the number and visibility of women in international assignments. Through a comprehensive review of the literature over the period from 1980 to now, this article charts the emerging themes and changes in the tone of dis-course: from when organizations were debating whether to “give women a chance” through attempts to identify and remove “blockages” to women's progress to, most recently, structural changes in the expatriate assignment and claims for women's superior affinity to operating internationally. We highlight gaps in the current literature and propose a platform for future research. We conclude with recommendations for practice. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Black and white and read all over: Race differences in reactions to recruitment Web sites
Author-Name: Goldberg, Caren B.
Author-Name: Allen, David G.
Abstract: Based on signaling theory, this study examines the impact of Web-site design and content characteristics on applicants' intentions to pursue employment, the mediating effects of engagement with the Web site and attitude toward the organization, and the moderating effects of applicant race on these relationships. The design characteristics of ease of use and usefulness impact attraction indirectly through Web-site engagement and attitude toward the organization. Further, Web sites' parasocial interaction (allowance for two-way communication) predicts intentions to pursue both directly and indirectly through engagement and attitude toward the organization. Unexpectedly, diversity statements did not impact attraction in the full sample. Multigroup analyses revealed that many of the paths between the predictors of parasocial interaction and (to a lesser extent) diversity statements and the outcomes differed by race, with stronger effects observed for blacks than whites. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Supporting a diverse workforce: What type of support is most meaningful for lesbian and gay employees?
Author-Name: Huffman, Ann H.

Author-Name: King, Eden B.
Abstract: We examine differences in type of support (i.e., supervisor, coworker, organizational) received by lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) employees and the relationship between type of support and relevant outcomes (job and life satisfaction, outness of sexual orientation). Surveys were administered to 99 LGB individuals, and results indicate that support is best viewed as a multi-dimensional construct composed of supervisor, coworker, and organizational support for LGB employees. Overall, supervisor support was related to job satisfaction, coworker support was related to life satisfaction, and organizational support for LGB employees was related to outness.Thus, support for LGB employees isrelated to important outcomes. Practical suggestions for increasing organizational support for LGB employees are offered. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The retirement of baby boomers along with a smaller cohort group of young people replacing them poses a challenge for employers in the future—where will they find the workers they need? One largely untapped source of human resources is people with disabilities (PWDs). Why have employers mostly ignored this large labor pool? This research used a semistructured interview approach with 38 executives across a broad array of industries and geographic regions to examine why employers don't hire PWDs and what they believe can be done to change this situation. Results show that most employers are not very proactive in hiring PWDs and that most employers hold stereotypical beliefs not supported by research evidence. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Our research explores the idea that formal mentoring relationships that cut across traditional organizational boundaries may facilitate positive interactions among an increasingly diverse workforce. We present interview, Web-survey, and focus-group data across an eight-month period from a pilot test of an interorganizational formal mentoring (IOFM) program sponsored by the Executive Leadership Council (ELC). Results indicate that IOFM provides valuable access to mentoring relationships that include trust and psychosocial support, access to legitimate organizational power, and the sharing of social capital across traditional organizational boundaries. The benefits and challenges of this approach to mentoring and diversity are examined. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Work‐life policy implementation: Breaking down or creating barriers to inclusiveness?
Author-Name: Ryan, Ann Marie
Author-Name: Kossek, Ellen Ernst
Abstract: Although many employers have adopted policies to supportthe integration of work with personal and family life, expected positive gains are not always real-ized. One reason for this gap is that practitioners and researchers often overlook how variation in policy implementation and use by different employee stake-holder groups fosters a culture of inclusiveness. We discuss four ways in which work-life policies are implemented (the level of supervisor support for use, universality of availability, negotiability, and quality of communication) and show how these affect the degree to which policies are seen as promoting inclusion or exclusion.These implementation attributes affect whether an adopted policy is perceived to fulfill work-life needs and act to signal the organization's support for individual differences in work identities and life circumstances. Implications for HR practitioners are discussed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Drawing on the recruitment, marketing, and explanation literatures, we examine how the language used to describe diversity practices in employee recruitment advertisements influences the organizational attractiveness perceptions of white, black, and Asian prospective applicants. Results show that prospective applicants' reactions to advertised support for identity-conscious diversity practices were moderated by applicants' race, applicants' previous discrimination experiences, and the type of explanation a firm used to support its use of diversity practices. The results of this article provide new insights into how firms can effectively attract a diverse applicant pool. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Beyond diversity training: A social infusion for cultural inclusion
Author-Name: Chavez, Carolyn I.
Author-Name: Weisinger, Judith Y.
Abstract: Contemporary organizations, in an effort to reap the benefits of a diverse workforce, continue to spend millions of dollars on diversity training despite the tendency of such training to either fail or result in less than desired outcomes. We introduce an alternative, strategic approach to organizational diversity designed to create a more inclusive “culture of diversity.”This long-term, relational approach emphasizes an attitudinal and cultural transformation, requiring managers to “break barriers” by moving away from “managing diversity” toward “managing for diversity” to capitalize on the unique perspectives of a diverse workforce. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Diverse succession planning: Lessons from the industry leaders

Author-Name: Virick, Meghna
Abstract: Although practitioners and academics alike have argued for succession planning practices that facilitate better talent identification and creation of stronger “bench strength,” there has been little attention to the incorporation of gender and racial diversity with succession planning.We discuss practices and competencies for incorporating diversity with succession planning and identify methods for developing women and minorities as successors for key positions. Improvements in strategy, leadership, planning, development, and program management processes are suggested. Recommendations for process improvement are developed from the diversity and succession planning literatures and interviews of 27 human resource professionals from a broad range of industries. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Making public organizations more inclusive: A case study of the Victoria Police Force
Author-Name: Metz, Isabel
Author-Name: Kulik, Carol T.
Abstract: In contrast to traditional models of change developed in the private sector, change in public-sector organizations often is initiated by noninclusive cultures, and the culture itself is the direct focus of the change effort. This article describes the strategies used by the Chief Commissioner of Police to change the Victoria Police Force's culture to be diversity-inclusive. We first explain how this change effort used traditional change strategies (e.g., organizational artifacts reflecting the new culture). We then analyze how it differs from traditional change models and explain the role of the broader system, such as legislative support, in the change process. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Diversity—Making space for everyone at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center using dialogue to break through barriers
Author-Name: Wong, Sharon
Abstract: Diversity is perhaps one of the most important concepts in today's business environment. Organizations have expended significant resources in this area in an effort to improve the bottom line, to become an employer of choice, to avoid lawsuits, and to “do the right thing.” Diversity is also one of the most difficult initiatives to implement in organizations because there are such diverse views on what diversity is and how deeply it should be woven into an organization's culture. Diversity can be difficult also because the dimensions of diversity are closely tied to an individual's personal beliefs, perceptions, and life experiences. These personal beliefs often present barriers to full inclusion and participation in the workforce. At NASA/Goddard, we are using dialogue and other initiatives to break through these barriers to create and sustain an equitable and inclusive workplace. Our Diversity Dialogue Project has been key in helping us to identify and address the diversity issues and concerns at the Center and in helping us to move confidently toward the future. This article describes the diversity journey at NASA/Goddard thus far and provides insight into the challenges and opportunities of such a journey.

Title: Breaking barriers and creating inclusiveness: Lessons of organizational transformation to advance women faculty in academic science and engineering
Author-Name: Bilimoria, Diana
Author-Name: Joy, Simy
Author-Name: Liang, Xiangfen
Abstract: To increase the representation and participation of women and other minorities in organizations, workplaces must become more inclusive. For such change to be successful and sustainable, organizations must systematically break down the barriers constraining women's participation and effectiveness; improve their prevailing structures, policies, and practices; and engender transformation in their climates. This article presents the experience of 19 U.S. universities, funded by the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE Institutional Transformation program, that have embraced comprehensive transformation for improved gender representation and inclusion in science and engineering disciplines. It describes the facilitating factors, program initiatives, institutionalization, and outcomes of their transformation, and suggests a transformation model that all organizations can use to create an inclusive and productive workplace for a diverse workforce. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Lirio, Pamela
Author-Name: Lee, Mary Dean
Author-Name: Williams, Margaret L.
Author-Name: Haugen, Leslie K.
Author-Name: Kossek, Ellen Ernst
Abstract: Increased interest in reduced-load (part-time) work among professionals who want to have a life beyond work has led to new challenges for managers who must sustain productivity while also supporting employees. However, to date, little attention has been focused on exactly how managers facilitate effective implementation of these alternative work arrangements. This study presents findings from an interview study of 83 cases of reduced-load professionals in 43 organizations in the United States and Canada. Analysis of the interviews with both professionals and their managers surfaced recurrent themes that led to identification of five clusters of behaviors and five clusters of dispositions that capture the nature of managerial support in implementing reduced-load work. The ten categories of behaviors and dispositions expand on existing notions of supervisory support and provide new insight into the role of managers in fostering inclusiveness. Additional quantitative analyses found significant relationships between the success of the reduced-load arrangements and specific managerial behaviors and dispositions. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The glass ceiling in human resources: Exploring the link between women's representation in management and the practices of strategic human resource management and employee involvement
Author-Name: Pichler, Shaun
Author-Name: Simpson, Patricia A.
Author-Name: Stroh, Linda K.
Abstract: Research on sex stereotypes suggests that gender bias is an invisible barrier—the so-called glass ceiling—preventing women from breaking into the highest levels of management in business organizations. Using data from a state-based professional HR organization, we investigated this phenomenon in the field of HR management. Building on the lack of fit model of gender discrimination and previous research, we tested two hypotheses: that women in HR are more likely to be concentrated in lower-level managerial positions in organizations that emphasize employee involvement (because of a related emphasis on stereotypically feminine managerial abilities) and that women in HR also are more likely to be concentrated in lower-level managerial positions in organizations that emphasize strategic human resource management (because of a related emphasis on stereotypically masculine characteristics). Our results support the first but not the second hypothesis. Theoretical and practical implications related to the glass ceiling are discussed. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Time out for family: Shift work, fathers, and sports
Author-Name: Root, Lawrence S.
Author-Name: Wooten, Lynn Perry
Abstract: Shift work is a fact of life for many workers. Almost one in six full-time hourly and salary employees works a shift outside the 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. window that researchers use to define the temporal bounds of the traditional workday. Almost half of those working in restaurants and bars work such alternate shifts, as do more than a quarter of workers in hospitals and manufacturing facilities. Drawing on interviews and observations in a Midwestern auto parts plant, this study explores how individuals in this predominantly male workforce talk about fulfilling family responsibilities in the face of relatively inflexible shift schedules. Interviews and observations reveal how the time pressures of shift work, particularly the afternoon-evening shift, affect the ability of fathers to participate in their children's activities, especially organized sports. Without formal options for scheduling flexibility, workers turn to a variety of informal approaches, such as ad hoc arrangements with sympathetic supervisors or the assistance of coworkers in covering for absences. In extreme cases, workers may engage in independent actions, often placing their jobs at risk. These findings contribute to the literature on work-family conflict and the gender dynamics of work-family life programs. By emphasizing the importance of including fathers in the work-family equation, they have practical implications for both employers and policymakers concerned with addressing the challenges of helping a contemporary workforce strike an equitable balance between work and family life. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: As the use of outsourcing as a staffing strategy continues, it is important to understand how the landscape of human resource management shifts in response to this strategy. Much of the existing outsourcing research in human resource management and organizational behavior has examined individuallevel responses. In this article, we use this research to identify the outsourcing-related challenges facing HR professionals in both the service provider and client organizations as they strive to attract, motivate, and retain high-performing employees and explore HR practices that may help achieve organizational goals. Areas in need of additional research are also identified. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: When less is more: The effect of devolution on HR's strategic role and construed image
Author-Name: Kulik, Carol T.
Author-Name: Perry, Elissa L.
Abstract: This research explores the possibility that devolving people-management activities to line managers might transform an HR unit and improve its reputation within its organization. We examined the effect of devolving people-management responsibilities to line managers on HR managers' construed image—their perceptions of the internal reputation of the HR unit. Results revealed that a devolution strategy had a positive effect on HR managers' perceptions of their unit's reputation among line managers and that this effect was partially mediated by changes in the HR function. Specifically, devolution increased HR's involvement in the operation of business units and in the organization's strategic planning. In turn, this change in HR's strategic role resulted in a more positive construed image for members of the HR unit. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Development and test of a model of external organizational commitment in human resources outsourcing
Author-Name: Lievens, Filip
Author-Name: Corte, Wilfried De
Abstract: Most prior outsourcing studies in the human resources domain have focused on the initial decision for outsourcing HR activities. Hence, little is known about HR managers' commitment to continue an already existing outsourcing relationship. This study constitutes a first step to increase our understanding of the factors related to the continuity of HR outsourcing relationships. We developed and tested a model of HR managers' (N = 186) commitment in outsourcing relationships. Affective commitment or the desire for the outsourcing relationship to continue was related to the depth and frequency of HR outsourcing. Conversely, continuance commitment, which refers to the constraints that keep the outsourcing relationship intact, was not related to the continuity of HR outsourcing. Finally, affective commitment was fostered by HR managers' perception that HR vendors shared the same values for managing people. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The question of when committed employees retire is important to consider under a defined-benefit pension plan, which credits employees with benefits of lower overall value for retiring either too early or too late. We find employees with higher levels of affective commitment more likely to plan to retire later and past the age when it is most financially attractive for them to leave the organization. In contrast, employees with moderate to high levels of continuance commitment plan to retire earlier and at ages when it is most attractive for them to do so.

Title: Women at work: Differences in IT career experiences and perceptions between South Asian and American women
Author-Name: Adya, Monica P.
Abstract: A growing minority representation in the information technology (IT) workforce coupled with a “youth bulge” in developing Asian countries are indicative of increasing diversity in the U.S. IT workforce. For researchers and practitioners, this diversity raises new management concerns. To better comprehend these emerging issues, this study compares career experiences and perceptions of South Asian women in the U.S. IT workforce with those of American women IT professionals. In doing so, it contrasts social, cultural, and individual factors that impact these career experiences. Interviews revealed that while most women from South Asia did not identify career genderization in the workplace, American IT professionals perceived greater stereotyping and discrimination. Although both groups equally felt the pressures of worklife balance, the impact of these pressures on long-term commitment to IT careers was felt differently across the two groups. Differences also are evident in perceptions of IT work, mentoring relationships, and coping mechanisms relied upon by the two groups. The article concludes with recommendations for improved diversity integration in the workforce and provides suggestions for future research in multicultural settings. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A case for sexual orientation diversity management in small and large organizations
Author-Name: Day, Nancy E.
Author-Name: Greene, Patricia G.
Abstract: In the 14 years since the Society for Human Resource Management added sexual orientation to its nondiscrimination statement, many organizations, including a large majority of Fortune 500 companies, have become more accepting of gay and lesbian workers. However, both small and large organizations may not have decided if this diversity is a type they wish to address. This article makes the case that to be competitive in the labor market and maximize the customer base, inclusiveness may be a requirement. We make this point by first describing current practices that create inclusive environments. To explore differences between small and large employers, we then present an exploratory study that shows that small firms may already have advantages in establishing inclusiveness. Interviews are presented that further investigate how work climates may exist for gay and lesbian employees in small and large organizations. Best practices and recommendations for creating and maintaining an inclusive workforce are then presented. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Organizational change cynicism: The role of employee involvement
Author-Name: Brown, Michelle
Author-Name: Cregan, Christina
Abstract: Organizational change efforts can bring about a range of outcomes: some intended, such as organizational survival and profitability, and some unintended, such as heightened levels of organizational change cynicism (OCC) among employees. This article focuses on processes for managing OCC: we examine the role of information sharing and involvement in decision making as ways to lessen employee reports of OCC. While both of these strategies have the potential to be effective, they rest on a significant assumption—namely, that employees will enthusiastically embrace any opportunities to become involved. In this research, we investigate this assumption through an analysis of the relationship between an employee's willingness to become involved (”active orientation”) on employee reports of their OCC. We find, using data from 1,214 public-sector employees, that an active orientation toward involvement plays a significant role as a moderator in reducing employee reports of OCC. The findings suggest that HR practitioners concerned about OCC should encourage their line managers to adopt a participatory style of management (information sharing, involvement in decision making), especially in those workplaces where employees are more likely to embrace the opportunities for involvement. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Strategic HRM in China: Configurations and competitive advantage
Author-Name: Chow, Irene H.
Author-Name: Huang, Jia‐Chi
Author-Name: Liu, Shanshi
Abstract: The strategic HR literature suggests that a firm will perform better through internal appropriate fit among HRM practices (the configuration fit) and through external appropriate fit between a firm's HRM practices and business strategy. The present study adopts a configuration approach to identify unique patterns of HR practices and business strategy that are posited to be maximally effective. The proposed relationships were empirically tested by surveying with a sample of 241 business firms in Guangzhou, South China, to find out the extent that four HR configurations could be successfully adopted in the Chinese context. The results revealed that HR configurations are significantly related to effect in predicting overall outcome performance and turnover, but not significantly related to effect on sales growth and profit growth rates. Research findings showed not only competitive strategies are significantly related to effect on HR configurations. The results also showed significant interaction effects between HR configurations and business strategy in their effect on profit and sales growth. These results further extended support for a contingency perspective in strategic HRM to the Chinese context, with significant practical implications for managing HRM in China. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Macdermid, Shelley
Abstract: Although human resource managers have critical insights into the successful implementation of reduced-load work arrangements, relatively few studies focus on their perspective. These arrangements are a growing work form for employees who choose to work less than full-time with a commensurate decrease in salary. Qualitative data analysis was used to identify key success factors noted in interviews with 52 HR managers in 39 companies. Individual employee characteristics (e.g., self-regulatory work habits) were viewed as most critical. Also important were the design of the arrangement (e.g., clarifying the arrangement in advance) and workgroup relationships (e.g., positive supervisor-employee relationships). We conclude with eight new takeaways for HR managers on how to create and sustain successful reduced-load work arrangements and directions for future research and practice. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Miller, Joseph A.
Abstract: When designing jobs, the degree of specialization is a key consideration. Though functional specialization allows workers to develop deep areas of expertise, it also increases the challenge of coordinating their work. In this article, we propose the concepts of stage- and site-based specialization and posit that together they can counteract the divisive effects of functional specialization. Taking advantage of a natural experiment in physician job design at a Massachusetts hospital, we explore the impact of stage- and site-based specialization on coordination and performance outcomes. Building on recent interest in relational approaches to job design, this study is the first to link relational job design to relational outcomes such as coordination. Our findings have practical implications for job design in professional service settings such as education, consulting, and health care. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of gainsharing under seniority-based pay systems on employee attitudes in Korea. It is hypothesized that gainsharing, which emphasizes performance, employee participation, and cooperation enhances employee perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice, and that this, in turn, produces positive employee attitudes. The participants were a sample of individuals from five firms that combined seniority-based pay and gainsharing incentives and five comparable firms that used only seniority-based pay. The results supported the partial mediation model whereby distributive and interactional justice partially mediated the effects of gainsharing on employee attitudes, but procedural justice did not. The practical implications of this international compensation research include careful consideration of the integration of gainsharing with the total rewards mix in an organization. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The role of corporate culture in the process of strategic human resource management: Evidence from Chinese enterprises
Author-Name: Wei, Li‐qun
Author-Name: Liu, Jun
Author-Name: Zhang, Yichi
Author-Name: Chiu, Randy K.
Abstract: Extant research on strategic human resource management (SHRM) has primarily focused on the content of SHRM (best practices, bundles of practices, etc.) and its effect on firm performance. Little research has examined the SHRM process so as to better understand how SHRM is adopted and implemented and what impact it has on organizational processes and outcomes. This article examines the role of corporate culture in the SHRM adoption and implementation process. Empirical results from a sample of 223 Chinese enterprises indicate that corporate culture has an impact on the adoption of SHRM, and that different types of culture affect the SHRM process differently. Specifically, group and developmental cultures have positive effects on the adoption of SHRM, but the effect of hierarchical culture is not significant. Developmental culture is also found to have a direct effect on firm performance. This study offers significant implications for HRM in China and other dynamic and emerging economies. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Revolutionizing the workplace: A case study of the future of work program at Capital One
Author-Name: Khanna, Shilpa
Author-Name: New, J. Randolph
Abstract: Today's workplace designs are being revolutionized due to the changing nature of work and worker profiles, the impact of technology, and the need for organizational efficiency and flexibility. Our case study of the Future of Work (FOW) program at Capital One highlights how thoughtful segmentation of work styles, supportive HR policy, customized workplace design, and the optimal use of technology can enhance knowledge work. FOW results show clear success in terms of increased employee satisfaction leading to improved organizational performance along with better real estate asset utilization and flexibility. To assist HR leaders and planners, we suggest a practical model that shows the impact of workplace design requirements on employee behavior and ultimately on organizational outcomes. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Preparing for organizational death: Proactive HR engagement in an organizational transition
Author-Name: Marks, Mitchell Lee
Author-Name: Vansteenkiste, Ronny
Abstract: This article describes an HR team's call to action in managing an organization's transition from healthy, vibrant, and financially successful workplace to its death after being acquired. The HR team countered conventional practice in two key ways. First, despite being from the seller's side, it acted unusually early in the company's acquisition and operated proactively throughout the integration process. This constructive approach stemmed from the self-confidence developed in the HR function over years of process improvement and culture change. Second, the HR professionals were motivated (rather than threatened) by the high stakes involved in this organizational transition. Their company—with its industry-leading business results and a loyal, long-tenured workforce—was slated to be closed, dismantled, and auctioned off in pieces to other firms. The HR team's mission was to help people deal with the death of their current employer and prepare for life afterward while maintaining a focus on business results. This article shows how HR helped senior leadership handle the challenge of retaining the talent needed to meet customer commitments and keep the business running while also readying people for an uncertain future with many eventual layoffs. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Like any value-creating staff function, HR departments should operate as a business within a business. Others have focused on the strategy and direction of HR departments. This article examines the next evolution for how HR department organization structure can deliver value based on two premises: (1) HR organization should be structurally aligned with the organization structure of the business and (2) because diversified/allied business models prevail, it is important to lay out the five roles and responsibilities of HR that respond to this organization model: service centers, corporate, centers of expertise, embedded HR, and operational HR. The article lays out the duties of each role, the relationship among these roles, and suggestions for implementing this new HR structure. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Career and international assignment fit: Toward an integrative model of success
Author-Name: Cerdin, Jean‐Luc
Author-Name: Pargneux, Marie Le
Abstract: This article examines how the fit between career and international assignment is likely to affect the success of the international assignment (IA) at its various stages. We propose an integrative model of IA success that encompasses three stages: pre-expatriation, expatriation, and repatriation. The main objective of this article is to contribute to the understanding of how individuals' career characteristics infl uence IA success during expatriation and repatriation. In our model, IA success is considered from both the individual and organizational perspective. In addition to drawing on the theory of fit to examine IA success during the expatriation and repatriation stages, we also use human capital and signal theory to examine the relationship between expatriation success and repatriation success. The propositions of our conceptual research provide practical and theoretical implications. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The influence of expatriate and repatriate experiences on career advancement and repatriate retention
Author-Name: Kraimer, Maria L.

Author-Name: Bolino, Mark C.
Abstract: We address repatriate retention from a career advancement perspective by developing a model that analyzes the effect of expatriate experiences and organizational career support on repatriates' career advancement upon return to the home country. Career advancement, in turn, is expected to affect the repatriate's perceived underemployment and turnover intentions. We collected data from a sample of 84 recently repatriated employees. Results revealed a curvilinear relationship between the number of international assignments and career advancement upon repatriation. Results also showed that developmental expatriate assignments were positively related to career advancement while the acquisition of managerial skills was negatively related to career advancement. Acquiring cultural skills, completing assignment objectives, and organizational career support did not relate to career advancement. In terms of outcomes, we found that perceived underemployment mediated the relationship between career advancement and turnover intentions. A lower level of organizational career support also resulted in greater turnover intentions. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The comparative roles of home and host supervisors in the expatriate experience
Author-Name: Benson, George S.
Author-Name: Pattie, Marshall
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of home and host supervisors on expatriate success. Using survey and archival data on 206 expatriates of a large U.S. professional services firm, we hypothesize that high-quality leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships with home and host supervisors have different outcomes. Relationships with host-country supervisors have greater influence on in-country and short-term outcomes, including adjustment and intentions to complete the assignment. Home-country supervisors, on the other hand, have a greater influence over expatriates' subjective fit with their jobs and longer-term perceptions of how the overseas assignment will impact their career. Using a separate survey of home and host supervisors at the same firm, we found that one reason that home and host supervisors infl uence expatriates differently may be because home supervisors are more likely to see professional development as a goal for expatriate assignments. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Failure to cope with a stressful repatriation transition can derail the global career experience. Repatriate stress-coping behaviors have not been examined empirically, however. This study explores the factor structure of an extensive array of coping strategies and their relation with repatriate adjustment. Data collected from 282 repatriates involved in a boundaryless repatriation experience reveal a factor structure consistent with problem- and emotion-focused dimensions documented elsewhere. Regression analysis finds negative associations between emotion-focused coping strategies and repatriate general, interaction, and work adjustment and positive relations between problem-focused strategies and repatriate interaction and work adjustment. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: International assignments have become an important part of managers' careers and are considered one of the most effective leadership development tools. Yet, studies consistently show that companies fail to integrate international assignments with long-term career development and succession planning and that a substantial percentage of expatriates leave the company upon completion of the international assignment. A total of 1,779 international assignees participated in a study that examined the factors associated with expatriate turnover intentions. The results indicate the importance of differentiating between two types of international assignments—developmental (or learning-driven) and functional (or demand-driven)—to understand expatriates' turnover intentions. While we found turnover intentions to vary depending on whether assignments are developmental or functional, the three sets of predictors of turnover intentions are similar. They are (1) lower satisfaction with company support, (2) higher repatriation concerns, and (3) lower career advancement opportunities within the company (relative to opportunities available outside the company). We discuss the implications for research and practice. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Expatriation outside the boundaries of the multinational corporation: A study with expatriate nurses in Saudi Arabia
Author-Name: Bozionelos, Nikos
Abstract: To date, research has largely neglected individuals who become expatriates on their own initiative and outside the boundaries of multinational corporations. This study, which focused on 206 non-Saudi expatriate nurses employed in a Saudi Arabian hospital, investigated the relationship of job satisfaction and turnover intentions with four factors: cross-cultural training, protégé experience, peer support, and the cultural clusters of the home and host countries. The study also examined the role of gender in the relationship of work attitudes with protégé experience and peer support. Protégé experience had the most consistent relationship with job satisfaction and turnover intentions, while attendance of cross-cultural training before expatriation was not involved in any of the identified relationships. In most conditions, protégé experience and peer support were associated with higher job satisfaction for expatriates of Arab origin. Finally, gender did not play a moderating role in the relationship of work attitudes with mentoring or peer support. These results shed light on the factors that help determine the success of non-corporate-sponsored expatriates and have implications for practice and future research. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The international assignments of peacekeepers: What drives them to seek future expatriation?
Author-Name: Emmerik, IJ. Hetty Van
Author-Name: Euwema, Martin C.
Abstract: From a social learning perspective, factors predicting seeking future international assignments and that are more or less under control of the human resource management department through training were examined. We tested our hypotheses on data from 745 Dutch peacekeepers. It appears that preparation, adventurism, and cultural empathy are important factors in willingness to expatriate again. Peacekeepers scoring high on self-effi cacy are more willing to accept future international assignments than peacekeepers scoring low on self-effi cacy. Further, the relationship between adventurism and seeking future international assignments is stronger for peacekeepers scoring high on self-effi cacy than for peacekeepers scoring low on self-effi cacy. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Hiring for retention and performance
Author-Name: Barrick, Murray R.
Author-Name: Zimmerman, Ryan D.
Abstract: This study evaluated the usefulness of several pre-hire variables to predict voluntary turnover and job performance. Analyses showed that applicants who knew current employees, had longer tenure with previous employers, were conscientious and emotionally stable, were motivated to obtain the job, and were confident in themselves and their decision making were less likely to quit, and had higher performance within six months after hire. Results also indicated that pre-hire attitudes (employment motivation and personal confidence) did not predict turnover and performance beyond biodata (pre-hire embeddedness in the organization and habitual commitment) and the personality traits (conscientiousness and emotional stability). For all predictors but personality, the strength of the relationships weakened over time up to two years after hire. Nonetheless, organizations can avoid voluntary turnover and increase performance by basing hiring decisions on the set of predictors analyzed in this study. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article analyzes the relationship between profit-sharing plans (PSP) and affective commitment and how it is affected by the context of the PSP application. Overall, there is a positive relationship between profit sharing and commitment that is strongest in very small firms. The efficacy of a PSP in improving employees' affective commitment appears to be greatest in firms with low job-related employee participation. Its application in workplaces where employees enjoy high levels of participation appears to have little impact and may even result in slight declines in affective commitment. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using gift exchange theory to explain the growing trend of employers offering employer-supported volunteering (ESV) benefits, this article discusses the creation of exchange relationships between the employer and employee and between the volunteer organization and employee. Hypotheses derived from the employee's perspective are tested with a nationally representative sample of volunteers (n=3,658). Findings suggest that ESV benefits are positively related to hours volunteered by the employee. Volunteer hours predict employee perceptions of skill acquisition, and such perceptions are positively related to perceptions of job success and employer recognition. We discuss the implications of these findings for business, employees, and volunteer organizations, with an emphasis on human resource management policy and practice. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) implies that it may be more efficacious for job performance raters to compare an employee to other employees rather than to use typical “absolute” rating standards. We assessed whether the incorporation of social comparisons into performance appraisals, using the relative percentile method (RPM), would predict criterion variance beyond that predicted by more traditional absolute ratings of performance. A sample (N=170) of managers involved in an assessment center was used, and the center provided criteria by which the relative criterion-related validity of social-comparative versus noncomparative (absolute) appraisals could be assessed. Overall, in consonance with a preponderance of earlier research, social-comparative (RPM) performance appraisals showed incremental criterion-related validity over traditional absolute performance appraisal methods. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: What makes employees stay with a particular employer? To find out, we developed a content model of 12 retention factors in the context of previous theory and research and analyzed open-ended responses from 24,829 employees in the leisure and hospitality industry. Our coding of their comments supported the identified framework and revealed that job satisfaction, extrinsic rewards, constituent attachments, organizational commitment, and organizational prestige were the most frequently mentioned reasons for staying. High performers and nonhourly workers were more likely to cite advancement opportunities and organizational prestige as reasons for staying, whereas low performers and hourly employees were more likely to cite extrinsic rewards. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating human resource management practices when the goal is to retain valued employees. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Effectiveness of organizational efforts to lower turnover intentions: The moderating role of employee locus of control
Author-Name: Ng, Thomas W. H.
Author-Name: Butts, Marcus M.
Abstract: In the current career climate characterized by change and turbulence, employees may demonstrate limited psychological attachment to their employers. Rousseau (1998) suggested that organizations can elicit psychological attachment from employees by reinforcing perceptions of organizational membership and demonstrating care and support for them. The effectiveness of these strategies, however, may depend on individuals' personality traits. In this study, we examined the moderating effect of locus of control in the relationship among four valued aspects of the work environment—information sharing, job significance, opportunity for learning, and availability of rewards for performance—and employees' intentions to stay. In two empirical studies, we found that information sharing, job significance, and locus of control interacted to positively affect intentions to stay and that opportunity for learning, availability of rewards for performance, and locus of control also interacted to increase intentions to stay. Implications of these results for theory building and practice are discussed. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The effects of expatriate demographic characteristics on adjustment: A social identity approach
Author-Name: Olsen, Jesse E.
Author-Name: Martins, Luis L.
Abstract: As demand increases for expatriates to manage far-flung operations in a global economy, scholars and practitioners are focusing their attention on the factors that contribute to expatriate success. One such factor is the support that expatriates receive from host country nationals (HCNs) with whom they work. Researchers interested in understanding expatriate success have not closely examined the phenomenon from an HCN perspective, however. At the same time, although we have gained a significant understanding of the roles of psychological, organizational, and contextual variables in the international assignment, there is still much to be understood about how expatriates' demographic characteristics affect their experiences in international assignments. Current findings regarding the effects of demographic characteristics often are inconsistent, highlighting the need for more complex theorizing. This article reviews recent research on the effects of expatriate demographic characteristics and proposes a social identity approach to understanding how these characteristics affect HCN support for the expatriate. It also seeks to develop a theory that addresses discrepancies in extant empirical findings, provides propositions to guide future research in the study of expatriates, and discusses implications for both researchers and practitioners. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Applying cognitive adjustment theory to cross‐cultural training for global virtual teams
Author-Name: Brandl, Julia
Author-Name: Neyer, Anne‐Katrin
Abstract: Global virtual teams are faced with the challenge of developing trust in a technology-mediated context to overcome anxiety and uncertainty in their interactions. Research shows that adjustment is a function of an individual's ability to manage his or her anxiety and uncertainty in an unknown context (Gudykunst, 1995). We propose that the type of cross-cultural training (CCT) received can influence cognitive adjustment in global virtual teams. Building on phenomenology and sense-making theory, we argue that training needs to develop global virtual team members' capabilities in dealing with the unknown rather than providing ready-made concepts of cultures. Managerial implications of our theoretical discussion of cognitive adjustment and how CCT influences it are discussed, as are directions for future research. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: External labor market strategy and career success: CEO careers in Europe and the United States
Author-Name: Hamori, Monika
Author-Name: Kakarika, Maria
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the career histories of the chief executive officers (CEOs) affiliated with the 500 largest organizations in Europe and the 500 largest in the United States. Our purpose is to determine whether frequent career moves across employers, a phenomenon we label an “external labor market strategy,” brings greater career rewards than moves inside the same organization. The results reveal that an external labor market strategy is negatively related to career success. On both continents, CEOs who have spent a smaller fraction of their career in their current organization or have changed employers more often have taken a longer time from the start of their career to be promoted to the most influential corporate positions. The labor market institutions in the 22 countries sampled do not influence the relationship between an external labor market strategy and career success, while the specific geographic region in which the employers are located has a limited impact on this relationship. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Capital gains: expatriate adjustment and the psychological contract in international careers
Author-Name: Haslberger, Arno
Author-Name: Brewster, Chris
Abstract: This paper argues that the notion of adjustment to careers involving international assignments needs to be developed further than the current literature reflects. An expatriate assignment is an expatriate's opportunity to build career capital and a company's opportunity to generate social and intellectual capital. The extent of the capital gains will depend considerably on the expatriate's adjustment during and after the assignment, which is influenced by the psychological contract. We argue that our understanding of the career impact of expatriation will be enhanced by a more refined picture of the adjustment that expatriates experience during the assignment and during repatriation. In particular, we examine adjustment as process rather than as event. We propose a broad conception of expatriate adjustment and its link to careers. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Learning barriers: a framework for the examination of structural impediments to organizational change
Author-Name: Schimmel, Remco
Author-Name: Muntslag, Dennis R.
Abstract: The body of knowledge on organizational learning is believed to be large and fragmented. Therefore, this knowledge seems to be of limited use to practitioners. We, however, present an alternative review of the most important publications on organizational learning that deals explicitly with learning barriers. The structural causes of problems with organizational learning are related to malfunctioning components of the cybernetic learning system of the organization. Thus, it became clear that the body of knowledge on organizational learning is less fragmented and does not contain any contradictions. This resulted in our construction of a framework in which the major contributions on organizational learning are integrated. It allows practitioners to use strengths of multiple theories to analyze change management problems. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Preventing burnout: the effects of LMX and mentoring on socialization, role stress, and burnout
Author-Name: Thomas, Christopher H.
Author-Name: Lankau, Melenie J.
Abstract: Halbesleben and Buckley's (2004) review of burnout research suggested a lingering need to examine the relationship between social support and burnout. We address that need by investigating Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) and mentoring as sources of workplace social support. We used data from 422 employees in a health care setting to test three structural models investigating the direct and indirect effects of LMX, supervisory mentoring, and nonsupervisory mentoring on organizational socialization, role stress, and burnout. Results suggest that high-LMX supervisors and nonsupervisory mentors serve as resources that minimize emotional exhaustion through increased socialization and decreased role stress. This study advances the literature on burnout by clarifying the effects of different types of social support in reducing burnout. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Moving beyond a legal‐centric approach to managing workplace romances: organizationally sensible recommendations for HR leaders
Author-Name: Pierce, Charles A.
Author-Name: Aguinis, Herman
Abstract: The goal of this article is to encourage human resource (HR) leaders to think more strategically about managing workplace romances. The traditional legal-centric management approach focuses on minimizing risks of workplace romances. We advocate embedding the legal-centric approach within a broader and more strategic organizationally sensible approach that provides a balanced focus on minimizing risks and maximizing rewards of workplace romances. Drawing from the empirical workplace romance literature, we derive a set of organizationally sensible best-practice recommendations that HR leaders can adopt to manage risks and rewards of romantic relationships in organizations. Implementing our more strategic recommendations should provide the added benefit of elevating HR professionals' roles as organizational leaders. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Leaders during a deep and prolonged downturn should introduce organizational practices that build capability in the organization, not only to withstand the uncertainties of rough times better, but also to emerge stronger for the future. We present a set of organization design changes that can create closer connections to the marketplace and better use knowledge in the organization to introduce new ways to deliver value while consuming fewer resources. During rapid change and extreme threats, steering the ship is not sufficient.

Author-Name: Jensen, Susan M.
Abstract: Workplace stress is a growing concern for human resource managers. Although considerable scholarly and practical attention has been devoted to stress management over the years, the time has come for new perspectives and research. Drawing from the emerging field of positive organizational behavior, this study offers research findings with implications for combating occupational stress. Specifically, data from a large sample of working adults across a variety of industries suggest that psychological capital (the positive resources of efficacy, hope, optimism, and resilience) may be key to better understanding the variation in perceived symptoms of stress, as well as intentions to quit and job search behaviors. The article concludes with practical strategies aimed at leveraging and developing employees' psychological capital to help them better cope with workplace stress. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to test how human resources management (HRM) practices and employees' knowledge influence the development of innovative capabilities and, by extension, a firm's performance. Results confirm that HRM practices are not directly associated with innovation unless they take into account employees' knowledge. Specifically, our analyses establish a mediating role for the uniqueness of knowledge between collaborative HRM practices and innovative activity, a positive influence of knowledge-based HRM practices on valuable knowledge, and a positive contribution of innovations to the company's profit. We tested hypotheses in a sample of firms from the most innovative Spanish industries through structural equation modeling. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Knowledge processes and learning outcomes in MNCs: an empirical investigation of the role of HRM practices in foreign subsidiaries
Author-Name: Simonin, Bernard L.
Author-Name: Özsomer, Ayşegül
Abstract: By examining the case of American and European firms operating in Japan, this article contributes to the central debate of how and when multinational corporations (MNCs) learn from their foreign subsidiaries. Through structural equation modeling, we assess how specific human resource management (HRM) practices (critical thinking encouragement, supervisory encouragement, learning incentives, deployment of internal mechanisms and processes, expatriation, and corporate training) enhance (1) knowledge transfer outflows from the subsidiary to other parts of the MNC and (2) the subsidiary's performance in its local market. We find learning orientation to be a key antecedent of all HRM practices we investigated. From a practical point of view, a noticeable finding relates to the lack of effects of critical thinking encouragement on market knowledge acquisition and dissemination when (1) there is a significant presence of expatriates in the subsidiary and (2) when local managers have access to training programs at headquarters (HQ) and other affiliates. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examine the role played by subsidiaries' human resource (HR) practices in the development of subsidiaries' knowledge stocks (defined as human and social capital) and the association of such knowledge stocks with knowledge transfer from subsidiaries to headquarters in multinational corporations (MNCs). Drawing on a survey of 151 Australian subsidiary senior executives of U.S., German, and Japanese MNCs, our findings suggest that the role of subsidiaries' HR practices lies in nurturing ties between a subsidiary and its external stakeholders and in accumulating knowledge of strategic importance not only for the subsidiary but also for its headquarters. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Tomsik, Joshua
Abstract: In this paper we outline an increasingly predominant, “communal,” perspective of the emerging knowledge economy and explore its emphasis on various nonmarket mechanisms of production. Although the communal perspective suggests organizational forms, governance mechanisms, and knowledge processes that may facilitate knowledge creation and knowledge transfer, we argue that it misses the seemingly contradictory trends of organizational disaggregation and the foundational importance of market mechanisms in knowledge creation. We contrast and partly reconcile these two perspectives of the knowledge economy and highlight key considerations related to the microfoundations of knowledge and human capital management. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Interunit interaction contexts, interpersonal social capital, and the differing levels of knowledge sharing
Author-Name: Mäkelä, Kristiina
Author-Name: Brewster, Chris
Abstract: Firms use different structural arrangements to carry out their internal work, and interunit interactions that take place in the context of these arrangements may have different consequences for knowledge sharing. We explore four contexts of such interunit interaction—interunit meetings, project groups, cross-border teams, and expatriate/ repatriate interactions—and we examine the extent to which they are associated with social capital and knowledge sharing. Data from structured interviews with multinational corporation (MNC) managers, which we explored using MANCOVA/ANCOVA and regression analysis, showed that cross-border and expatriate/repatriate interaction contexts are associated with more interpersonal trust and shared cognitive ground than interunit meeting and project group ones, and the expatriate/repatriate context with more shared cognitive ground than all other contexts. The regression results show a significant relationship between the cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing. We also find that affective and cognitive social capital mediate the relationship between cross-border team and expatriate/repatriate contexts and knowledge sharing. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We adopt the social network perspective to develop a conceptual model and examine the relationship among human resource (HR) practices, interpersonal relations, and intrafirm knowledge transfer in knowledge-intensive firms. Our results indicate that work design, along with training and development HR practices, can shape the structural relation. At the same time, both also exhibit potential for shaping affective and cognitive relations within a firm's social network. While the effects of work design along with training and development HR practices on intrafirm knowledge transfer are primarily mediated by interpersonal relations, we found some evidence for arguing that incentives and motivation HR practices directly affect intrafirm knowledge transfer. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Dynamic HR: global applications from IBM
Author-Name: Morris, Shad S.
Author-Name: Calamai, Robert
Abstract: As business leaders increasingly understand the importance of effectively managing a global workforce, attention turns to the human resource (HR) function. But as HR groups focus largely on best practices, they lose sight of the constantly shifting demands of a global environment that requires next practices. We propose a new Dynamic HR framework that allows HR managers constantly to renew and reintegrate their practices throughout the organization in a way that focuses on flexible entrepreneurship and coordinated networking among dispersed HR managers. Such demands require HR managers who not only are connected with one another across the globe, but also are one step ahead of shifting local and global demands. Using practical examples from IBM, we discuss techniques that might help HR become more dynamic. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This paper broadens the conceptualization of multinational corporation (MNC) knowledge management to include the importance of active involvement in a liaison role by host country nationals (HCNs), particularly those working directly with expatriates. Based on our field research and work experience in international settings as well as current research literature, we identify and consider several beneficial components of this liaison role in local knowledge management, including cultural interpreter, communication facilitator, information resource broker, talent developer, and change partner. We also call for future research to help build upon our present model and to provide practical guidance in human resource (HR) policy and practice to help organizations take advantage of this potentially valuable liaison role. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Kulik, Carol T.
Author-Name: Cregan, Christina
Author-Name: Metz, Isabel
Author-Name: Brown, Michelle
Abstract: Toxin handlers are organizational members who help colleagues manage negative emotions in the workplace. Although toxin handling activities help distressed employees remain productive, they put the toxin handler at risk of emotional exhaustion. In this research, more than 400 HR managers described their experience managing emotionally charged employee problems. We found that formalizing toxin handling responsibilities provided a buffering effect: HR managers whose organizations had made handling emotionally charged employee problems a formal part of HR responsibilities experienced lower levels of emotional exhaustion and perceived HR as more effective, even when they engaged in high levels of toxin handling. Formalizing toxin handling responsibilities may protect HR managers from harm and ensure that they maintain the toxin handling function in their organizations. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Generally showing a stable fi ve-factor structure, high test-retest correlations, very high Cronbach's alphas, and almost no social desirability bias in self and peer evaluations, the ICMS is sensitive enough to detect test-retest differences. Thus, socially responsible strategic international HR programs can use this scale to reliably evaluate employees and their families for specifi c international locations. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Thinking strategically about integrating repatriated managers in MNCs
Author-Name: Jassawalla, Avan R.
Author-Name: Sashittal, Hemant C.
Abstract: Although multinational corporations (MNCs) invest considerable resources in sending managers on foreign assignments, too many managers report dissatisfaction with their postrepatriation careers, and a significant percentage leave the firm within a year. This failure to harness learning and develop a cadre of globally trained managers raises questions about the current objectives and strategies that drive the investment in expatriation. A study of managers who had recently completed their expatriate assignment points to underorganized home office operations, poorly defined mentor roles, and large gaps between managers' expectations and reality as key contributors to the problem. This paper calls for a strategic orientation toward managing the expatriate function and proposes a comprehensive configuration of processes, systems, and structures necessary for implementing new strategies for developing the next generation of globally trained managers. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A meta‐analytic investigation of the relationship between HRM bundles and firm performance
Author-Name: Subramony, Mahesh
Abstract: Human resource management bundles consisting of multiple complementary practices are typically considered superior to individual best practices in influencing firm performance. This study investigates the relationship between three such bundles (empowerment, motivation, and skill-enhancing) and business outcomes (retention, operating performance, financial performance, and overall performance ratings). A meta-analysis of 239 effect sizes derived from 65 studies reveals that HRM bundles have significantly larger magnitudes of effects than their constituent individual practices, are positively related to business outcomes, and display effect sizes that are comparable to or larger than those of high-performance work systems. These findings reaffirm the case for firm-level investments in synergistic HRM combinations and highlight the importance of investing in complementary practices. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Perry, Elissa L.

Author-Name: Field, Marina P.
Abstract: Sexual harassment training is a common human resource activity, and the practitioner literature is replete with advice about how to implement it. Little research, however, has specifically explored what makes sexual harassment training effective. This paper uses what we know from general training research and theory and sexual harassment research to assess the extent to which the practitioner literature is making relevant and reasonable recommendations for sexual harassment training. We identify practitioner-research gaps in the literature, including areas that academic research and theory suggest are important for training effectiveness but where the practitioner literature falls short. The practitioner literature may be silent, offer incomplete advice, make recommendations that do not directly link to research findings, or present recommendations that are inconsistent with research findings. We recommend that these gaps be bridged and we provide specific suggestions for how human resource managers can improve the quality of the sexual harassment training they provide. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managerial characteristics and willingness to send employees on expatriate assignments
Author-Name: Benson, George S.

Author-Name: Datta, Deepak K.
Abstract: This paper examines the characteristics of managers that influence their willingness to send employees on expatriate assignments. Data from 336 senior managers in a major U.S. professional services firm indicate that managers who are higher up in the organizational hierarchy are more willing to send employees on expatriate assignments. In addition, our findings show that managers who have more extensive international experience are more inclined to send employees on such assignments and that managers with expatriate experience themselves are much more willing to send their employees overseas, regardless of whether they currently work with international clients. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Encouraging knowledge sharing among employees: How job design matters

Abstract: Job design is one of the most frequently researched practices in the Human Resource Management (HRM) literature, and knowledge sharing has become an important and heavily researched managerial practice. The links between these practices, however, have received little attention in the literature. We argue that job design matters to knowledge sharing for motivational reasons. Specifically, jobs contain characteristics that stimulate different kinds of motivation toward knowledge sharing, which have different effects on individual knowledge sharing behavior. We develop six hypotheses that unfold these ideas and test them on the basis of individual-level data collected within a single firm. The hypotheses are tested in a LISREL model that confirms that job characteristics, such as autonomy, task identity, and feedback, determine different motivations to share knowledge, which in turn predict employees' knowledge sharing behaviors. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Negrini, Alessia
Abstract: Using a sample of 514 French late-career managers representing a variety of occupations and organizations, we investigated the relations among perceived HRM practices, organizational commitment, and voluntary early retirement. We found that the provision of training opportunities was associated with the most favorable outcomes. It was related to higher affective and high-sacrifice commitment, lower lack of alternatives commitment, and reduced voluntary early retirement. On the other hand, we found that flexible working conditions and the assignment of older workers to new roles (for example, mentor or coach) did not have the expected positive effects. In addition, our results highlight the importance of disentangling the components of continuance commitment, as high-sacrifice commitment was associated with reduced likelihood of voluntary early retirement, while lack of alternatives commitment had the opposite effect. These findings suggest that voluntary early retirement should be incorporated as a major outcome in future organizational behavior research. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Why some firms adopt telecommuting while others do not: A contingency perspective
Author-Name: Mayo, Margarita
Author-Name: Pastor, Juan‐Carlos

Author-Name: Cruz, Cristina
Abstract: Using a contingency perspective and data from 122 CEOs of Spanish firms, this paper examines what makes a firm likely to adopt telecommuting. We hypothesized that employer adoption of telecommuting would depend on organizational constraints (age and size of the firm), the international composition of the workforce, and the top executives' leadership style. In turn, we argue that firms adopting telecommuting would emphasize outcome-based control systems. Our empirical evidence showed that telecommuting correlated with small organizational size, a high proportion of international employees, and variable compensation. A contingent reward leadership style at the top moderated the effects of firm age and internationalization on the adoption of telecommuting. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Outsourcing occupational safety and health: An analysis of the make or buy decision
Author-Name: Nuñez, Imanol
Abstract: This paper investigates the factors affecting the outsourcing decision of occupational safety and health (OSH) services. I posit several hypotheses following the three main approaches to the make or buy question: (1) the transaction cost theory, (2) the resource-based view of the firm, and (3) the behavioral decision-making framework. The empirical analysis draws on microdata from 3,047 Spanish firms that are legally obliged to provide organized OSH activities but free to choose the option to outsource. Results show that informational symmetries and increasing transaction costs mainly explain the decision to outsource the OSH activity. Organizational behavior variables, such as management commitment to safety and workers' representation, also relate to the outcome of the decision but not necessarily as hypothesized. Finally, I did not generally observe the strategic value of safety in informing the make or buy decision. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Global firms often struggle to replicate practices among their culturally and geographically dispersed subsidiaries. Part of the reason for this is that certain practices, including human resource management (HRM) practices, are complex and context specific. In this study, we develop a framework to help identify how firms might overcome challenges of practice replication through alignment of information systems, application processes, and people. We find that managerial alignment of formal processes and systems, along with informal alignment of people (shared objectives), improve the capability of a multinational corporation (MNC) to replicate human resource practices across subsidiaries. We also discuss managerial implications. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Rousseau, Denise M.
Abstract: MBA internships are commonly used for training and recruiting management talent. Yet, research overlooks what makes them effective. A longitudinal study investigates the relationships that goal clarity, autonomy, and prior experience have with MBA intern learning and job acceptance intentions. Results show learning partially mediates the relationship of goal clarity to job acceptance intentions, and that less experienced MBA interns learn more under conditions of high goal clarity and low autonomy (i.e., when their roles are more structured). We discuss how role structures and learning can inform effective training and recruiting of interns, and management of short-term workers in general. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Stock based rewards are often used to motivate high-level managers to take actions to increase the stock price of the firm. However, numerous constraints may weaken the perceived link between individual effort and stock price appreciation for many recipients. This study introduces a new construct, stock price expectancy, which we define as individuals' perceptions of influence over their firm's stock price. We examined its antecedents in a sample of 349 high-level U.S. managers and found that employment at corporate headquarters, firm size, hierarchical level, and contact with investment analysts predicted stock price expectancy perceptions. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Considerable attention has focused on how multinational corporations (MNCs) deal with the simultaneous pressures of globalization and localization when it comes to human resource management (HRM). HR function activities in this process, however, have received less focus. The study presented here identifies configurations of the corporate HR function based on international HRM (IHRM) structures, exploring how issues of interdependency shape corporate HR roles. The study is based on 248 interviews in 16 MNCs based in 19 countries. The findings are applied to develop a contextually based framework outlining the main corporate HR function configurations in MNCs, including new insights into methods of IHRM practice design. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The aim of this research was to explore relations between work and family demands and resources, work-to-family conflict (WFC), and work and family outcomes in a cross-cultural comparative context involving Taiwanese and British employees. Two-hundred and sixty-four Taiwanese employees and 137 British employees were surveyed using structured questionnaires. For both Taiwanese and British employees, work and family demands were positively related to WFC, whereas work resources were negatively related to WFC. Furthermore, WFC was negatively related to family satisfaction. More importantly, we found that nation moderated relationships between work resources and WFC, WFC and work, and family satisfaction. Specifically, work resources had a stronger protective effect for Taiwanese than British in reducing WFC, whereas WFC had a stronger detrimental effect on role satisfaction for British than Taiwanese. It is recommended that both culture-general and culture-specific effects should be taken into consideration in designing future WFC research and familyfriendly managerial practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Godkin, Lynn
Abstract: This exploratory study evaluates the ethical considerations related to employees fired for their blogging activities. Specifically, subject evaluations of two employee-related blogging scenarios were investigated with established ethical reasoning and moral intensity scales, and a measure of corporate ethical values was included to assess perceptions of organizational ethics. The first scenario involved an employee who was fired because of innocuous blogging, while the second vignette involved an employee who was fired because of work-related blogging. Survey data were collected from employed college students and working practitioners. The findings indicated that the subjects' ethical judgments that firing an employee for blogging was unethical were negatively related to unethical intentions to fire an employee for blogging. Moral intensity was positively related to ethical judgments and negatively related to unethical intentions to fire an employee for blogging, while individual perceptions of ethical values were negatively associated with unethical intentions. Finally, subjects perceived that terminating an employee for innocuous blogging that did not target an employer was more ethically intense than was firing an employee for work-related blogging. The implications of the findings for human resource professionals are discussed, as are the study's limitations and suggestions for future research. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Way, Sean A.

Author-Name: Thacker, James W.
Abstract: Previous research has suggested that workforce mixing—simultaneously using contingent workers and standard employees—can negatively affect standard employee attitudes and behaviors. In this study, we consider the impact of two reasons employers choose to use contingent workers (to enhance standard employee employment stability and to reduce labor costs) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors (absenteeism and turnover). We posit that when the aim of using contingent labor is to enhance standard employee employment stability (employment stability contingent labor strategy or ESCLS), the effects on standard employee withdrawal behaviors will differ from when the aim is to reduce labor costs (labor cost contingent labor strategy, or LCCLS). Using a sample of 90 firms that employ a mixed workforce, we examine the influence of ESCLS, LCCLS, and high investment HR systems (HIHRS) on standard employee withdrawal behaviors at the firm level. In addition to supporting the hypothesized direct (positive) effect of LCCLS on standard employee withdrawal behaviors, this study's results support the hypothesized moderating effects of HIHRS on the negative relationship between ESCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors and the positive relationship between LCCLS and standard employee withdrawal behaviors. Implications for research and practice and suggestions for further research are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Given the ubiquity, time investment, and theoretical relevance of meetings to work attitudes, this study explored whether organizational science should consider employee satisfaction with meetings as a contemporary, important, and discrete facet of job satisfaction. Using affective events theory, we postulated that meetings are affect-generating events that meaningfully contribute to overall job satisfaction. Two surveys queried working adults: Study 1 used a paper-based survey (n = 201), while Study 2 used an Internet-based survey (n = 785). Satisfaction with meetings was positively related to and significantly predicted overall job satisfaction (p < .05) after controlling for individual difference variables (e.g., participant background variables, negative affect), traditional job satisfaction facets (e.g., work, supervision, pay), and other conceptually relevant constructs (e.g., satisfaction with communication, organizational commitment). Exploratory (Study 1) and confirmatory (Study 2) factor analyses provided evidence that meeting satisfaction is a distinct facet of job satisfaction. Finally, as hypothesized, the relationship between meeting satisfaction and job satisfaction depends in part upon the number of meetings typically attended. The relationship was stronger (more positive) when meeting demands were higher and weaker when meeting demands were lower. Implications for assessment, leadership development, on-boarding, and high potential initiatives are discussed. ©2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Today's workforce encompasses a wide variety of employees with specific needs and resources when it comes to balancing work and life roles. Our study explores whether various types of work-life balance support measures improve employee helping behavior and performance among single employees, employees with a partner, and employees with a partner and children. Using a sample of 482 employees at 24 organizations, the results showed that the organization's work-family culture improved work performance among parents but reduced performance among singles. Singles' work outcomes improved, however, when they had access to flexible work arrangements, whereas couples benefited from their supervisors' social support. The results stress the importance of the employee's household structure when considering appropriate support for balancing work and life roles. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines workplace issues of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) employees. Specifically, we analyze the effect of firm GLBT nondiscrimination policies on that firm's stock market value. Corporate equality index (CEI) is used as a proxy for how firms manage GLBT issues. Results reveal that changes in firms' standardized CEI scores are positively associated with changes in firms' standardized stock price trend during the following year. Our findings suggest that the stock prices of firms with more progressive GLBT nondiscrimination policies relative to competing firms in the same industry outperform otherwise equivalent firms with lower CEI scores. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Recognizing opportunities for new businesses is an important part of the entrepreneurial process, one that researchers seek to explain and human resource managers seek to encourage. In this study, we examined whether the same genetic factors that affect openness to experience also influence recognizing opportunities. We applied bivariate genetics techniques to a sample of twins and found that a substantial part of the heritability of recognizing opportunities is mediated through genetic influences on openness to experience. Evidence of genetic effects on opportunity recognition has important implications for how companies might think about selection and training and raises important ethical issues in human resource management. ©2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Adopting HRM practices and their effectiveness in small firms facing product‐market competition

Author-Name: Cardon, Melissa S.
Abstract: Small firms face many challenges in creating a productive workforce given often severe resource constraints and informal organizational structures. This may be particularly problematic in industries with intense product-market competition. In this study, we focus on the relationship between product-market competition and labor productivity, particularly as influenced by both adopting human resource management (HRM) practices and having a group culture within the organization. We examine our model using data from 145 UK-based small- and medium-sized enterprises. Our findings suggest that having a group culture is a key factor in the extent to which HRM practices are adopted, as well as how effective adopting these practices is for increasing labor productivity. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Sen‐Gupta, Sukanya
Author-Name: Edwards, Paul K.
Author-Name: Blackburn, Robert A.
Abstract: The process of managing a small firm differs from managing a large firm, because small firms face distinct forms of risk and organize their human resources differently, often informally (Kotey & Slade, 2005; Storey, 2002). This paper introduces and tests a new variable, self-reported job quality (SRJQ), as a key link in the causal chain between HR practices and outcomes. In comparing small firms with large ones, we present three key findings: (1) employee reports of job quality are highest in small firms and decrease as firm size increases; (2) in workplaces owned by large firms, job quality is highest in the smallest workplaces; and (3) workers in small workplaces owned by large firms report lower job quality than workers in comparable sized workplaces owned by small firms. Our findings are partially explained by how formally HR practices are implemented. We show that formality increases with firm size and workplace size. Importantly, evidence suggests that employing an HR professional (a key indicator of HR formality) lowers SRJQ in single-site SMEs. Implications for small business owners, HR professionals in large and small firms, and policy makers are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employee perceptions of repatriation in an emerging economy: The Indian experience
Author-Name: Kulkarni, Mukta
Author-Name: Lengnick‐Hall, Mark L.
Author-Name: Valk, Reimara
Abstract: As employees' international mobility has increased, implementing repatriation processes has become a significant human resource (HR) issue. Through an exploratory study using a semi-structured interview method, we examine repatriated employees' views about HR activities that facilitate and hinder the repatriation process in the emerging economy of India. Respondents described lack of formal repatriation assistance, no contact person in HR to help with repatriation, and lack of re-entry culture-related training as characteristic of the repatriation process. Managing employees' expectations, along with creating a more sensitive, structured, and strategic HR function, are recommended to improve the repatriation process. From a theoretical perspective, results point to the multi-dimensionality of the repatriation construct and provide evidence of the context-specificity of HR practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Recruitment and retention in foreign firms in India: A resource‐based view
Author-Name: Holtbrügge, Dirk

Author-Name: Puck, Jonas F.
Abstract: Foreign firms in India currently face two major challenges in human resource management (HRM): personnel recruitment and retention. For this study, we adapted the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and tested which recruitment and retention practices positively impact the number of qualified applicants and the attrition rate in a sample of 80 North-Western European firms. Our findings suggest that a close relationship exists between using recruitment and retention practices shaped according to the RBV and these two efficiency criteria. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice as well as how our findings might transfer to other contexts. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Emerging human resource practices at Aditya Birla Group
Author-Name: Som, Ashok
Abstract: This article describes in detail through a longitudinal case study the emerging nature of human resources (HR) practices at Aditya Birla Group and, more importantly, links it to the strategic redesign that the whole organization underwent from 1995 to 2006. The longitudinal case study provides a snapshot of the dynamic and turbulent nature of the new liberalized Indian economic environment and how an organization such as Aditya Birla Group needed to brace itself from competition through innovative HR practices. The article argues that in challenging liberalizing business environments like India, the nature of HR itself demands that organizations develop new capabilities and that HR's role is to reevaluate its competencies and develop new ones to help in the overall strategic redesign of organizations. The article elaborates on two critical issues: (1) the peculiarities and defining characteristics of HR models unique to India and (2) the main factors that shape people management policies and practices in the liberalized Indian environment. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managing BPO service workers in India: Examining hope on performance outcomes
Author-Name: Combs, Gwendolyn M.

Author-Name: Nadkarni, Sucheta
Abstract: Much attention has been given to the explosion in business process outsourcing (BPO) operations in India. Little concern, however, has been paid to the performance of Indian service workers in these fast-paced and sometimes turbulent environments. Using a sample of 160 service workers from a privately held BPO firm in India, we examine the relationship between Indian service workers' hope and their performance outcomes. Regression and structural equation model analyses indicated a significant positive relationship between Indian service workers' levels of hope and their performance. These promising results highlight the importance of measuring and managing employee hope to maximize employee productivity and performance. By effectively developing and managing levels of employee hope, Indian BPO firms can effectively combat employee problems such as attrition, stress, and burnout that have plagued the BPO industry. Hope may also help mitigate the influence of aspects of Indian culture on human resource management practices in Indian BPOs. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: (How) Does the HR strategy support an innovation oriented business strategy? An investigation of institutional context and organizational practices in Indian firms
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Author-Name: Saini, Debi S.
Abstract: This paper investigates how human resources are managed in firms of different ownership forms in India and the extent to which strategic human resource management (hereafter strategic HRM) techniques have been adopted to support an innovation-oriented business strategy. Based on a qualitative study of 54 Indian managers from different firms, this study highlights the Indian institutional context for strategic HRM. It reveals the extent to which the Western approach to and configuration of high-commitment/performance models of HR practices may differ from those found in Indian firms. This study also has a number of practical implications for HR professionals, HR practices, and organizations in the global context. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Outcomes of intention to quit of Indian IT professionals
Author-Name: Krishnan, Sandeep K.
Author-Name: Singh, Manjari
Abstract: Intention to quit has been getting attention in the context of employee attrition, with focus on its antecedents. A related aspect that needs attention is the outcome of intention to quit, where little research has occurred, especially in the Indian context. The present study explores performance orientation, organizational deviance, and organizational citizenship behavior as outcomes of intention to quit of Indian IT professionals. These factors become critical in the context of human resource management because employees who want to quit may become less productive or even dysfunctional for the organization. Interviews and a questionnaire-based survey were used in this research. The survey was conducted using software professionals with work experience of less than four years, with the results based on 533 responses. The initial results show that as hypothesized, intention to quit does lead to less performance orientation, higher organizational deviance, and less organizational citizenship behavior. Further, exploration using structural equation modeling shows that performance orientation mediates the relationships between intention to quit and organizational citizenship behavior as well as between intention to quit and organizational deviance. This study's findings imply that organizations need to understand that employees with a high intention to quit can prove costly from multiple dimensions. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Diversity management in India: A study of organizations in different ownership forms and industrial sectors
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Author-Name: Saini, Debi S.
Abstract: Strategically managing workforce diversity is a value-adding HR function that enhances organizational performance. Managing diversity is a complex and unique HR issue in India due to its religious and cultural diversity and the use of legislation by the Indian state to tackle societal inequities and complexities. This paper contributes to existing knowledge on diversity management and strategic HRM in the Indian context through an in-depth case study of 24 firms of different ownership forms in a number of industries in India. The main method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with 110 managers at various levels and 102 non-managerial employees. Each interview was conducted individually. This paper takes the U.S.-originated concept of diversity management in the HRM context as a starting point. It uses this as a guide to investigate how the concept is understood and operationalized in several leading business organizations across different ownership forms and industrial sectors in India. Results reveal the differences between Western MNCs and Eastern firms as well as the varying views of Indian managers and employees on issues related to diversity management. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Tymon,, Walter G.
Abstract: This study explores the role of HR practices for individual and organizational success via a survey of 4,811 employees from 32 units of 28 companies operating in India. We report on employee perceptions of the effectiveness of three specific human resource practices within their firms and the relationship of these practices to career success, performance, and potential. Companies operating in India appear to be creating strong human resource climates based on structured HR practices in performance management, professional development, and normalized performance ratings. The perceived effectiveness of these HR practices influences employees' perceptions of career success and, to a lesser extent, organizationally rated performance and potential. We report differences in perceptions of HR practices among national, international, and global companies and among the industries of information technology (IT), manufacturing, and services. The relationship to perceived HR practices and outcomes was partially contingent on firm geographic scope and industry sector. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Linking emotional dissonance and organizational identification to turnover intention and emotional well‐being: A study of medical representatives in India
Author-Name: Kumar Mishra, Sushanta
Author-Name: Bhatnagar, Deepti
Abstract: Influencing customers' perception of service quality through service interaction is becoming imperative for organizations to sustain competitive advantage. As a result, the critical challenge before many organizations is to retain employees in service occupations and promote their well-being. This study examined the relationship of organizational identification and emotional dissonance with turnover intention and well-being among a sample of 468 medical representatives in the Indian pharmaceutical industry. Drawing from the conservation of resource theory, this study shows that apart from its direct effect, emotional dissonance has a mediating effect on the relationship of organizational identification with turnover intention and emotional well-being. Contributions of this study to the theory and practice of human resource management (HRM) are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Dreher, George F.
Abstract: To supplement the extant mentoring literature that has taken a predominantly Western/U.S. perspective, the present study examined the nature of mentoring relationships in a highly power-distant and collectivistic culture such as India. Twenty-nine Indian masters of business administration (MBA) students participated in a qualitative study (using in-depth interviews) regarding Indian conceptualizations of mentors, the dynamics of mentoring relationships, their mentoring experiences in India, and the practice of mentoring as a career management tool. Content analysis revealed that while some aspects of mentoring seem culturally invariant, other aspects might be influenced by careers and socio-cultural contexts. The findings are discussed from relational and cultural perspectives with theoretical and practical implications for cross-cultural management and human resource practice. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Organizations invest substantial resources in research and development (R&D) to increase long-term performance. Despite these investments, contextual contingencies can impact innovation. Our findings show that Chinese manufacturers with cultures emphasizing innovation and teamwork more effectively use financial resources in the innovation process. Findings also demonstrate that the impact of education on innovation is greater with low stability and high teamwork and innovation orientations. Results also indicate that a culture emphasizing outcomes and stability leads to lower levels of innovation irrespective of financial and human resources invested. Finally, we found a negative curvilinear interaction between R&D spending and outcome orientation on innovation. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Boosting corporate entrepreneurship through HRM practices: Evidence from German SMEs

Author-Name: Brettel, Malte
Abstract: Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) is highly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to remain competitive. It is difficult for these organizations, however, to choose relevant SME management practices to induce CE. The goal of this study is to determine which human resource management (HRM) practices promote CE in SMEs. We examined the interrelationships between specific HRM practices (staff selection, staff development and training, staff rewards, specialist assignments) and CE dimensions (innovativeness, risk propensity, proactiveness, new business venturing, and self-renewal). To that end, we analyzed empirical data from a cross-sectional dataset of 214 knowledge-intensive German SMEs. The results provided empirical evidence for the strong impact of staff selection, staff development, and training as well as staff rewards on CE. We contribute to current CE/HRM research, which is generally rather qualitative, by identifying specific productive approaches that SMEs can use to increase entrepreneurial activity through HRM practices and by discussing the positive impacts that such activity can produce. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Datta, Deepak K.
Abstract: This study investigates how internationalization is associated with investing in HRM within entrepreneurial firms from emerging markets. Using a sample of 171 firms from India, China, and South Africa, we show that when firms internationalize either into more economically developed countries or into countries with stronger employment regulations, they also invest more in HRM practices. Moreover, firms led by CEOs with general management experience and those more concerned with meeting international standards invest more in HRM practices. Finally, HRM investments are also greater in entrepreneurial firms characterized by extensive international partnerships. Overall, our findings suggest that internationalization by entrepreneurial firms in emerging markets is associated with developing HRM practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In his blunt and engaging manner, visionary entrepreneur Dwight Carlson has insightful and provocative things to say about leadership, communication and team development, and motivation. We argue that Carlson is an “entrepreneurial leader” who has learned how to create an environment that fosters innovation, hard work, a sense of fun, and “team spirit” and which results in highly motivated and productive staff. At the same time, we recognize that not all entrepreneurs necessarily share Carlson's “bravado.” Nevertheless, his example as founder and CEO of several high-tech start-up companies sheds light on the unique contours of entrepreneurial human resource leadership. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Individual and contextual correlates of managers' attitudes toward depressed employees
Author-Name: Martin, Angela
Abstract: Managers' attitudes toward depressed employees play an important role in effectively managing depression in the workplace. The present study pilot tested a survey measure of managers' attitudes toward depressed employees (n=225). Exploratory factor analysis showed evidence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions in the measure of attitudes. Regression analyses examined relationships between the measure and a range of proposed individual and contextual correlates. Results showed that more negative attitudes toward depressed employees were endorsed by managers who reported a more internal locus of control, higher levels of stress, less familiarity with depression, and greater reticence to seek help. Managers who perceived their organizations to have unsupportive depression disclosure norms reported higher levels of stigma, and those whose organizations had a clear mental health strategy reported lower levels of stigma. The findings have important implications for developing human resource management strategies that deal with the increasing incidence and impact of depression in the workplace. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A missing link in the transfer problem? Examining how trainers learn about training transfer
Author-Name: Hutchins, Holly M.

Author-Name: Berthelsen, Alice May
Abstract: This study describes and reports the methods training professionals use to learn about training transfer. Specifically, this study focused on trainers' use and perceived utility of the literature (research and practitioner-based) to develop their knowledge of how to support training transfer in their organization. Consistent with extant research conducted on human resource professionals, our survey results suggest that training professionals seek knowledge mostly through informal learning (e.g., job experiences, discussions with internal and external training professionals, books, searching the Web), but they prefer to learn about training transfer in discussions with external trainers and academics. As a follow-up to the survey, our interview results indicate that trainers select learning methods based on source quality, motivation, and accessibility, but these differed based on which learning methods were chosen. Ideas to guide future human resource researchers are presented within the framework of information-seeking theory. This paper concludes by discussing practical implications for increasing trainer competencies that support training transfer in organizations. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managing temporary workers by defining temporary work agency service quality

Abstract: This study investigates and defines the concept of service quality of a temporary work agency (TWA) from the perspective of temporary workers as the TWA's internal customers. Specifically, we conducted two surveys using two separate samples of temporary workers to (1) develop a measure of TWA service quality based on service literature and (2) test the newly developed measure's reliability, factor structure, and validity. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis results show that an effective temporary work agency is one that offers reliable placement services, appears interpersonally supportive in interacting with the temporary workers, provides individualized and customized service, is furnished with appealing tangible facilities and equipment, and offers services that are conveniently accessible before, during, and after the temporary job assignments. Structural equation modeling results further suggest that TWA service quality is directly related to temporary workers' customer satisfaction with the TWA and perceived TWA service value and is indirectly related to temporary workers' customer loyalty to the TWA. Research and practical implications of this research are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Swimming against the tide: Outward staffing flows from multinational subsidiaries
Author-Name: Collings, David G.
Author-Name: McDonnell, Anthony

Author-Name: Lavelle, Jonathan
Abstract: Studying the flows of parent country nationals in multinational enterprises (MNEs) to subsidiary operations has a relatively long tradition. Studying flows of subsidiary employees to other subsidiaries, as third country nationals, and to the corporate headquarters, as inpatriates, however, has empirically much less pedigree. Drawing on a large-scale empirical study of MNEs in Ireland, this paper provides a benchmark of outward flows of international assignees from the Irish subsidiaries of foreign-owned MNEs to both corporate headquarters and other worldwide operations. Building on insights from the resource-based view and neo-institutional theory, we develop and test a theoretical model to explain outward staffing flows. The results show that almost half of all MNEs use some form of outward staffing flows from their Irish operations. Although the impact of specific variables in explaining inter-organization variation differs between the utilization of inpatriate and third country national assignments, overall we find that a number of headquarters, subsidiary, structural, and human resource systems factors emerge as strong predictors of outward staffing flows. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using the foundation of social exchange theory, we examined underlying mechanisms linking the relationship of high-performance human resource practices and corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Specifically, we explore why and under what conditions these two concepts are related. A multilevel analysis of data from biotechnology pharmaceutical enterprises in the People's Republic of China revealed that employees' perceived organizational support (POS) mediated the relationship between high-performance human resource practices and CE. Further, organizational culture moderates the relationship between high-performance human resource practices and employees' POS.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in using Web sites to recruit applicants, little theoretical or empirical research has examined how firm attributes influence the effectiveness of recruitment Web sites. We developed and tested a model that examines the relationships among the firm's reputation as an employer, the attributes of the firm's Web site, and applicant attraction using data on business students' reactions to the recruitment Web sites of 144 firms. Results indicated that the amount of company and job attribute information provided on a recruitment Web site, the Web site's vividness, and the firm's reputation as an employer have a three-way interactive effect on prospective applicants' perceptions of the recruiting organization. As such, certain Web site attributes were more effective for firms with poor reputations and others for those with a good reputation. The implications of these results for recruitment research and for firms using Web sites as recruitment tools are discussed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Investigating the impact of organizational culture on supply chain integration
Author-Name: Braunscheidel, Michael J.
Author-Name: Suresh, Nallan C.
Author-Name: Boisnier, Alicia D.
Abstract: Supply chain integration constitutes the major thrust of supply chain management initiatives. In this study, we investigate the effects of organizational culture to determine the types of cultural characteristics that are strongly associated with efforts to integrate the supply chain and delivery performance. Previous researchers have theorized and demonstrated that organizational culture leads to adopting management practices consistent with the culture and that these practices are associated with firm performance. There has been a relative dearth of research, however, on the impact of organizational culture in operations management literature. Thus, this study investigates the effects of organizational culture, measured by the competing values framework (CVF), on two types of supply chain integration efforts: (1) internal integration and (2) external integration with key suppliers and key customers. Employing the CVF, we assess organizational culture along four dimensions—market, hierarchy, clan, and adhocracy. Results indicate that culture does influence firms to adopt internal and external integration practices. Our findings also provide evidence that a firm's adhocracy culture score is positively associated with external integration, while a firm's hierarchy culture score is negatively associated with both internal and external integration practices. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Supporting long‐term workforce planning with a dynamic aging chain model: A case study from the service industry
Author-Name: Größler, Andreas
Author-Name: Zock, Alexander
Abstract: This study demonstrates how a dynamic, aging chain model can support strategic decisions in workforce planning. More specifically, we used a system dynamics model (a modeling and simulation technique originating from supply chain management) to improve the recruiting and training process in a large German service provider in the wider field of logistics. The key findings are that the aging chain of service operators within the company is affected by a variety of delays in, for example, recruiting, training, and promoting employees, and that the structure of the planning process generates cyclic phases of workforce surplus and shortage. The discussion is based on an in-depth case study conducted in the service industry in 2008. Implications are that planning processes must be fine-tuned to account for delays in the aging chain. The dynamic model provides a tool to gain insight into the problem and to improve the actual human resource planning process. The value of the paper lies in the idea of applying a well-known and quantitative method from supply chain management to a human resource management issue. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Linking human capital to competitive advantages: Flexibility in a manufacturing firm's supply chain
Author-Name: Jin, Yan
Author-Name: Hopkins, Margaret M.
Author-Name: Wittmer, Jenell L. S.
Abstract: Flexibility in a manufacturing firm is a strategic choice that advances the firm's superior performance. This is especially true in the emerging supply chain, which makes the firm's environment particularly turbulent. This paper examines the critical relationships between a manufacturing firm's human capital, the firm's flexibility, suppliers' flexibility, and the firm's competitive advantages. Based on questionnaire responses from 201 senior supply chain management professionals in several manufacturing industries, this study establishes direct links between a manufacturing firm's human capital and the firm's superior flexibility, and between a manufacturing firm's flexibility and its competitive advantages. In addition, this research finds that the firm's flexibility mediates the relationship between the firm's human capital and its competitive advantages, as does the connection between the suppliers' flexibility and the firm's competitive advantages. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: An exploratory study of governance in the intra‐firm human resources supply chain
Author-Name: Farndale, Elaine
Author-Name: Paauwe, Jaap
Author-Name: Boselie, Paul
Abstract: The human resource management (HRM) literature has paid insufficient attention to supply chain management (SCM) when exploring the architecture of human resources (HR). Drawing on an SCM perspective, this study develops our understanding of (1) the intra-firm HR supply chain, and (2) how this HR supply chain influences corporate governance processes within large organizations. We argue that the HR function, represented as an internal professional service supply chain, needs appropriate governance principles as it operates through multiple delivery channels and with a wide variety of HRM practices. Exploratory findings from a qualitative empirical study of seven large organizations investigating governance and risk management in the HR supply chain are presented. These in-depth interviews uncover how formal governance is relatively easy for these organizations to achieve, supported by outcome-focused monitoring tools, but informal governance mechanisms can fail due to insufficient attention. Although standardized approaches to HR delivery can maximize the opportunity for HR governance, little evidence was found that the organizations were considering the related governance implications explicitly. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Evolving HR practices in a strategic intra‐firm supply chain
Author-Name: Koulikoff‐Souviron, Marie
Author-Name: Harrison, Alan
Abstract: While there are several studies on human resource management (HRM) at the inter-firm dyadic relationship level, the HR aspects of intra-firm strategic supply relationships have been largely ignored. Yet interdependence requires coordination among functions, sites, and stages of the internal supply chain (SC). Drawing on a case study of a large European pharmaceutical company, which we call Tyrenco, we explore how HR practices evolve within the strategic intra-firm supply relationship. Our findings illustrate the disruptive effects of HR practices when they are focused on site-based objectives and the improved coordination that results from redesigning HR processes to achieve internal operational integration. We highlight the tension between site-based, financial controls and an emergent SC logic. Drawing on recent interest in cooperative approaches to HR practices, this study seeks to operationalize the need to align HR practices with end-to-end objectives at different stages of the intra-firm supply chain. Our findings have practical implications for designing HR practices within multinational corporations (MNCs) that are characterized by complex and fragmented internal environments. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: CEOs with a functional background in operations: Reviewing their performance and prevalence in the top post
Author-Name: Koyuncu, Burak

Author-Name: Hamori, Monika
Abstract: With this study, we update research by Ocasio and Kim (1999) by testing whether the trends that favored the prevalence of CEOs with an operations background in the 1980s and early 1990s continued between 1992 and 2005. Given that supply chain management became a top business priority during this period, we expect a greater prevalence of CEOs with an operations background. This is because, traditionally, executives belonging to the operations function have assumed responsibility for supply chain management issues. Our results, based on a sample of 437 CEOs who lead large-sized U.S. firms in eight industries, provide partial support for the hypothesis that CEOs with a functional background in operations attain higher post-succession performance than CEOs with other functional backgrounds. In addition, we find that the likelihood that newly appointed CEOs have a background in operations is greater in succession events that have taken place more recently and in situations that occurred in the face of poor firm financial performance. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The impact of job embeddedness on innovation‐related behaviors
Author-Name: Ng, Thomas W. H.
Author-Name: Feldman, Daniel C.
Abstract: It has often been argued that low turnover leads to less innovation in organizations, not only because fewer job vacancies are available for outsiders with new ideas, but also because longer-tenured employees might be more resistant to change. In this study, we propose that job embeddedness may actually strengthen employees' motivation to generate, spread, and implement innovative ideas in organizations. In a longitudinal study with a diverse sample, we found that job embeddedness was positively and significantly related to innovation-related behaviors, even after controlling for demographic variables, the job attitudes, and the job perceptions that are frequently associated with job embeddedness. In addition, we found some support for the proposed moderating effects of career stage; that is, the relationship between job embeddedness and implementing innovative ideas was stronger for individuals in the mid- and late stages of their careers than for those in the early stage of their careers. This article concludes with directions for developing future theory. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article demonstrates that a diversity and equality management system (DEMS) contributes to firm performance beyond the effects of a traditional high-performance work system (HPWS), which consists of bundles of work practices and policies used extensively in high-performing firms. A DEMS typically includes diversity training and monitoring recruitment, pay, and promotion across minority or other disadvantaged groups. Our analysis of quantitative data from service and manufacturing organizations in Ireland confirms that HPWS practices are associated with positive business performance and finds specifically that DEMS practices are positively associated with higher labor productivity and workforce innovation and lower voluntary employee turnover. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using a qualitative approach, this study fills a void in the literature on strategic HRM by analyzing Austrian CEOs' perceptions of the role of the HR department in their organizations, and the conditions that affect the development of a strategic role. The results suggest that even if CEOs have an overall positive evaluation of their HR departments and are willing to delegate responsibility for higher-level decision-making, to develop the HR department's role, CEOs must also feel they have the scope to do so.

Title: Reducing burnout in call centers through HR practices
Author-Name: Castanheira, Filipa
Author-Name: Chambel, Maria José
Abstract: Previous research on call centers has demonstrated that human resource (HR) practices can be related to employee stress; however, these studies did not examine the linking mechanisms underlying these associations. Using the job demands–control (JD-C) model as a theoretical framework, we examine perceived job demands (namely, emotional dissonance and quantitative demands) and autonomy as potential mediators in the relationship between HR systems and burnout (exhaustion and cynicism). We distinguish between HR control systems, which include performance monitoring practices, and HR involvement systems, which include training, participation, and performance-related pay. This study samples 811 employees working in 11 call centers. Our findings support the idea that HR systems can help reduce burnout in call centers by verifying that HR control systems associated with more emotional dissonance and less autonomy increase burnout. On the other hand, an HR involvement system decreases workers' burnout because it alleviates the job demands of emotional dissonance and quantitative demands. This study fills a gap in the literature between HR systems and burnout by demonstrating the role job demands and autonomy play in explaining how HR systems improve or decrease workers' exhaustion and cynicism. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Bell, Myrtle P.
Abstract: Questions about diversity training's utility and effectiveness remain despite its widespread use and the significant investments many firms make in such training. As a result, some HR practitioners have doubts about its relevance in the workplace. In this paper, we envision a future state of diversity training whereby diversity is embedded into work practices and programs through direct knowledge transfer, continuous skill development, and accountability for learning. We recommend four specific guidelines that HR leaders can follow to achieve this “future state” called A.G.E.M.—Approach, Goals, Executive Commitment, and Mandatory Attendance. We suggest that following the A.G.E.M. approach will lead to the kind of transformative behavioral changes required for effective diversity training programs.

Title: Does structuring of human resource management processes enhance employee creativity? The mediating role of psychological availability
Author-Name: Binyamin, Galy
Author-Name: Carmeli, Abraham
Abstract: In this study, we develop a theoretical conceptualization and an operational definition of structuring of human resource management (HRM) processes and examine how this structuring enables employee creativity at work. Analyzing the data collected from employees and their managers in knowledge-intensive workplace settings, we examine a mediation model that suggests that the relationship between structuring of HRM processes and employee creativity is best explained in terms of the intervening variables of perceived uncertainty, stress, and psychological availability. Results suggest that structuring of HRM processes is negatively associated with perceived uncertainty and stress. These perceptions produce a sense of psychological availability, which in turn enhances employee creativity. This study offers new insights about diagnosing the level of structuring of HRM processes and the ways managers and HR directors facilitate its implementation in their organization. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Voice, silence, and diversity in 21st century organizations: Strategies for inclusion of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees
Author-Name: Bell, Myrtle P.

Author-Name: Sürgevil, Olca
Abstract: Employee voice has been largely examined as a universal concept in unionized and non-unionized settings, with insufficient attention to diversity of workers (Rank, 2009). As invisible minorities, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) employees provide a valuable focal point from which to examine employee voice mechanisms. Positing that GLBT employees are often silenced by what is perceived as “normal” in work organizations, this paper identifies some of the negative consequences of this silencing and proposes ways in which the voices of GLBT employees and other invisible minorities can be heard. With its relevance to policies and practices in other organizations, the “Don't ask; don't tell” policy of the U.S. military is used as a lens through which to analyze voice, silence, and GLBT employees in other organizations. Heterosexist environments can foster organizational climates of silence, where the feeling that speaking up is futile or dangerous is widespread among employees. Specific recommendations are provided for HR managers to facilitate the expression of voice for GLBT employees in today's increasingly diverse organizations. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Henley, Amy B.
Abstract: Bridging the literature of procedural justice, social identification, and voice, we present a conceptual model of observers' voice responses to injustices perpetrated on coworkers. Based on social identity theory, we contend that similarity to the target of injustice influences observer identification with the target, as moderated by the observer's scope of justice, which then influences the observer's perceptions of injustice and decision to express voice. Additionally, we posit that the link between observers' perceptions of injustice and expressed voice is moderated by the observer's perceived opportunity to express voice. Finally, we propose that the decision to express voice individually or collectively depends on the justice climate along with the costs and benefits associated with each option. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Although many studies have shown that the opportunity to provide input (voice) leads to more favorable employee reactions, fewer studies have examined the boundary conditions for the effect of voice on worker outcomes. Building upon Greenberg and Strasser's (1986) model of personal control in organizations, we hypothesize that the positive effect of voice on intent to remain will be less pronounced for employees with longer organizational tenures. Converging results of national surveys from the United Kingdom and the United States support the anticipated relationships. It appears the beneficial effects of voice on employee attitudes may decrease as employees accrue tenure with their employer. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using exchange theory, this study examines how perceptions of employee voice, the employee–line manager relationship, and trust in senior management are related to organizational commitment. It is hypothesized that the direct relationship between perceptions of opportunities for employee voice and organizational commitment is mediated by the longer-term effects of the perceived employee–line manager relationship and trust in senior management. Multiple regression analysis of a sample of 2,291 employees in organizations undergoing significant change finds some support for this hypothesis, highlighting in particular the importance of trust in senior management as a partial mediator of the relationship between employee voice and organizational commitment. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Assessing human resource practices alignment: A case study
Author-Name: Heneman, Herbert G.
Author-Name: Milanowski, Anthony T.
Abstract: Research has established the link between HR practices and organizational performance, suggesting that the HR system has great strategic potential to drive organizational effectiveness. To capitalize on this potential, the organization must design and deliver HR practices that focus on necessary employee performance competencies, creating an HR system with vertical and horizontal alignment around those competencies. Doing this requires that the organization first assess how its HR practices are currently aligned and then develop ideas for improving HR practice that will be alignment enhancing. We call this diagnostic process Human Resource Alignment (HRA) assessment. We describe an HRA assessment process we developed and applied in a large public school district for the key job of teacher. The assessment was based on the district's formal teacher performance competency model used, and was conducted by a group of human resources and instructional job experts from the district. These experts rated the degree of vertical and horizontal alignment and then developed suggestions for HR practice changes that would improve alignment. After describing the process and results, we present a series of lessons learned and directions for future research. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between employee voice and job satisfaction using data from the 2007 Australian Workplace Representation Survey (AWRPS) of 1,022 employees. Drawing on human resource management and industrial relations literature, we test hypotheses concerning the relationship between direct and union voice arrangements and job satisfaction. This relationship represents a gap in the literature, which is important from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Controlling for a range of personal, job, and workplace characteristics, regression analyses suggest that although evidence of voice complementarity exists, direct voice appears to be the central voice arrangement underpinning employees' job satisfaction.

Title: The effects of downsizing on labor productivity: The value of showing consideration for employees' morale and welfare in high‐performance work systems
Author-Name: Iverson, Roderick D.
Author-Name: Zatzick, Christopher D.
Abstract: Although downsizing remains a topic of great interest to scholars and practitioners, little research has examined the link between the process and organizational performance. The current study examines whether organizations showing greater consideration for employees' morale and welfare in the downsizing process experience increased labor productivity. Further, because downsizing diminishes human capital and interferes with an organization's social exchange relationships, we posit that attention to employees' morale and welfare will be particularly important for high-performance work systems (HPWS) that rely on human capital for competitive advantage. We tested our hypothesis with a sample of organizations that had downsized using survey data matched with secondary data. Results support our prediction that organizations with more extensive HPWS can reduce productivity losses from downsizing by heightening their consideration for employees' morale and welfare. We discuss the implications of these findings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Testing alternate predictions for the performance consequences of middle managers' discretion
Author-Name: Caza, Arran
Abstract: Although discretion among employees at organizations' lower levels seems to be increasing, it is uncertain whether this is a desirable HRM policy. To understand this issue better, this study tests competing organization theory predictions about the performance consequences of middle managers' perceived discretion. Discretion is defined as the freedom of action or decision authority available in managing subordinates. Survey data from a multinational, European sample of research and development (R&D) units were used to assess the effect of managers' perceived discretion on unit performance. The results show that a combination of ecology theory and strategic choice theory best predicts the relationship between discretion and unit performance. Greater perceived managerial discretion was linked to increased unit performance in a relationship moderated by managerial experience and limited by unit size. These findings have implications for HRM theory and practice, particularly regarding policies related to empowerment and leadership development. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: New times for employee voice?
Author-Name: Wilkinson, Adrian
Author-Name: Fay, Charles
Abstract: In this review, which also serves as an introduction to this special section, we briefly discuss the growing interest in employee voice and how and why interest in this topic has emerged over the last few years. “Employee voice” has been used to summarize several different approaches to employee relations, and numerous other terms have been used interchangeably with “employee voice.” In this introduction, we discuss the different approaches to voice, and, relying on the literature of HRM, political science, industrial relations, and organizational behavior, we develop a specific conceptualization of voice useful to scholars and HRM professionals. We discuss the direction of research in this area and summarize the papers in this issue. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The role of calculative attachment in the relationship between diversity climate and retention
Author-Name: Kaplan, David M.
Author-Name: Wiley, Jack W.
Author-Name: Maertz, Carl P.
Abstract: This study enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between diversity and employee retention. The study found that positive perceptions of an organization's “diversity climate” were related to decreased turnover intentions and found support for the proposition that calculative attachment mediated this relationship. In addition, the study considered potential interactions with diversity climate perceptions in predicting calculative attachment and found support for satisfaction with pay as a moderator, but not supervisor effectiveness. Finally, the study determined that the benefits of a positive diversity climate may extend to all employees, including White men. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Inducements, contributions, and fulfillment in new employee psychological contracts

Abstract: This longitudinal study of newly hired Chinese college graduates (N = 143) investigates the effects of contract fulfillment, employee reports of company inducements (organizational support and job rewards), and supervisory reports of individual contributions (job performance and extra-role citizenship behavior) upon changes in the graduates' psychological contracts. Three survey waves were administered a year apart, starting with the recruits' job offer acceptance. Analyses revealed that employee fulfillment and perceived contributions predicted particular changes in employer psychological contract obligations, whereas employer fulfillment and perceived inducements predicted changes in employee obligations. The effects of inducements on employee obligation changes and contributions on employer obligation changes were mediated by their respective fulfillment measures. Changes in obligations were greater in the first year of employment than in the second. This study yields implications for managing newcomers and researching the initial phase of employment. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study tests the effect of age diversity on firm performance among international firms. Based on the resource-based view of the firm, it argues that age diversity among employees will influence firm performance. Moreover, it argues that two contextual variables—a firm's level of market diversification and its country of origin—influence the relationship between age diversity and firm performance. By testing relevant hypotheses in a major emerging economy, that is, the People's Republic of China, this study finds a significant and positive effect of age diversity and a significant interactive effect between age diversity and firm strategy on profitability. We also find a significant relationship between age diversity and firm profitability for firms from Western societies, but not for firms from East Asian societies. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this study's findings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Castro, Stephanie L.
Abstract: This paper reports the results of two studies undertaken in the same Fortune 500 company as it adopted an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program. Study 1 assessed employees' perceptions of fairness, trust, and turnover intentions regarding ADR options. Compared with other options for ADR, a program consisting of mandatory mediation followed by mandatory and binding arbitration (MMBA) resulted in significantly lower levels of procedural fairness perception, organizational trust, and intentions to stay with the firm. Contrary to previous research, no significant effects were found related to respondents' demographic characteristics and their reactions to ADR program characteristics. In Study 2, job-applicant flow data were evaluated and compared by corporate region to determine the effects of an MMBA program installed in one region. Results revealed no significant effects related to the MMBA program on the organization's ability to recruit and ultimately fill key positions. As in Study 1, no significant effects were found in Study 2 for the demographic characteristics of applicant race/ethnicity, gender, or age on applicant recruitment decisions. Although Study 2 results indicated job candidates are unaffected by the existence of an MMBA program, given Study 1's results, practitioners should be cautious about implementing such a program for current employees. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The effect of primed goals on employee performance: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Shantz, Amanda
Author-Name: Latham, Gary
Abstract: Overwhelming evidence in the behavioral sciences shows that consciously set goals can increase an employee's performance. Thus, HR professionals have had little, if any, reason to be interested in subconscious processes. In the past decade, however, laboratory experiments by social psychologists have shown that goals can be primed. That is, people's behavior is affected by goals of which they are unaware. Because a conscious goal consumes cognitive resources, this finding has important implications for employee efficiency in the workplace. This paper discusses the results of priming a performance goal in two organizational settings. Call center employees who were primed using a photograph of a woman winning a race raised significantly more money from donors than those who were randomly assigned to a control group. A meta-analysis revealed that a photograph can prime the subconscious to increase job performance. The results of the present study demonstrate that subconscious motivation is a concept worthy of exploration for both human resource scholars and practitioners. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Effects of the workplace social context and job content on nurse burnout
Author-Name: Lee, Jenny S.Y.
Author-Name: Akhtar, Syed
Abstract: Job burnout is a continuing concern for human resource management, as it affects employee productivity and well-being. In particular, the nursing profession is widely recognized as a stressful occupation that leads to burnout. The present study examines the relative significance of workplace social context in a health care setting and the job content of the nursing profession for influencing the three dimensions of job burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of a random sample of 1,190 nurses working in 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong. The results indicate that although both the workplace social context and job content have significant effects on burnout dimensions, the effects of the workplace social context were significantly stronger. In addition, the workplace social context had a significant negative effect on personal accomplishment, whereas job content influenced personal accomplishment positively. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of devising management interventions for dealing with job burnout in the nursing profession. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Knowledge transfer in multinationals: The role of inpatriates' boundary spanning
Author-Name: Reiche, B. Sebastian
Abstract: Viewing knowledge as rooted in individuals, this study investigates knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs) from an individual-level perspective. Specifically, the author focuses on inpatriates as a particular group of knowledge actors in MNCs and examines the role of inpatriates' boundary spanning between their home unit and the headquarters for transferring their knowledge to headquarters staff. Based on a sample of 269 inpatriates in 10 German MNCs, the author found that inpatriates' boundary spanning is positively related to inpatriates' individual efforts to transfer knowledge and inpatriates' perceptions of HQ staff efforts to acquire subsidiary-specific knowledge. Both perceived HQ absorptive capacity and mentoring by HQ staff moderate these relationships. This study's findings contribute to our understanding of the theoretical mechanisms through which MNC knowledge flows occur and highlight key requirements for the design of international staffing practices. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Alignment, integration, and consistency in HRM across multi‐employer networks
Author-Name: Marchington, Mick

Author-Name: Grimshaw, Damian
Abstract: Most studies of human resource management (HRM) have been conducted within the context of the single employing organization, which is strange given the recent growth in multi-employer networks. In this study, the authors examine whether alignment, integration, and consistency—concepts central to or implicit in most analyses of HRM—has meaning and relevance in the multi-employer context. They focus specifically on networks in which collaboration is intended to deliver high levels of product quality or customer service, precisely where one might expect employers would be attracted to “strong” HRM systems. Data was collected via interviews and document analysis in four networks, spanning both the public and private sectors in the United Kingdom. Despite a set of potentially favorable conditions within these networks to promote alignment, integration, and consistency, implementation was impeded by other equally powerful forces, including differences in employer goals within networks, especially between public and private sector organizations; intraorganizational tensions within internal labor markets for organizations involved in networks; using divergent HR policies between organizations within multi-employer networks; and contradictions between the pursuit of “among employee” or “temporal” consistency for workers. Rather than prescribing a one-size-fits-all solution for these problems, it is argued that detailed analysis of each network is necessary. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The differential effects of job design on knowledge workers and manual workers: A quasi‐experimental field study in China
Author-Name: Yan, Ming
Author-Name: Peng, Kelly Z.
Author-Name: Francesco, Anne Marie
Abstract: When Taylorism was discarded long ago, job enrichment emerged as a good alternative. Recent research, however, has pointed out the ineffectiveness of job enrichment. This study suggests that both approaches could be effective and looks at job nature as the moderator that can affect how the two approaches are applied. The authors' longitudinal quasi-experimental field study in China found a significant interaction between worker type (knowledge workers [KWs] versus manual workers [MWs]) and job characteristics on employee outcomes. After enrichment, KWs experienced higher satisfaction and task performance, whereas for MWs, satisfaction and performance declined. This pattern of results suggests that both job enrichment and Taylorism are applicable depending on the job nature. In addition to contributing to job design theory, the present study also explored the unique attributes of KWs and provides practical suggestions as to how human resource managers can better motivate KWs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In this study, the authors examine the relationship between high-commitment HR practices and firm performance in professional services firms through the mediator of employee effort. In addition, they contribute to the debate in the field of strategic HRM on whether high-commitment HR practices should be used across all employee groups within a firm. Their study's results show that high-commitment HR practices positively relate to firm performance through employee effort for two employee groups within professional services firms. Further, they found that the relationship between effort and performance is contingent on the value of the employee group to firm competitive advantage, suggesting that companies may only want to expend the effort and resources on building a high-commitment HR system for employee groups that are clearly tied to creating firm competitive advantage. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The ambiguities and tensions in creating and capturing value: Views from HRM consultants in a leading consultancy firm
Author-Name: Donnelly, Rory
Abstract: Creating and capturing value in knowledge-intensive organizations is often marked by a high degree of ambiguity. The resource- and knowledge-based views of the firm assume that this ambiguity enhances an organization's competitive advantage, but do not acknowledge or address the problems and tensions it creates for employees. This study contributes to developing these views by providing new insights based on analyzing how HRM consultants perceive their contribution and standing in the context of this ambiguity. These findings shed light on the importance of addressing consultants' perceptions of this ambiguity in seeking to manage and motivate them to maximize the creation and appropriation of value for consultancy practices. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Using coaching practices as a manifestation of such an approach, this study reports on coaching and other career practices that are part of supportive and developmental career management in a Belgium sample (n = 154). Three other types of career management were identified as well. Supportive and developmental career management was most present in organizations that had a past or current prospector strategy, and was the least present in past or current defenders. The type of business strategy organizations indicated to pursue in the future did not have an influence on the type of career management they currently had. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Scholars have suggested that the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance can be moderated by the organizational context in which turnover occurs. However, there are few empirical studies that examine such moderating effects. Using a sample of 161 firms in South Korea, this study investigates how the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance is moderated by three context variables: (1) the degree of organizational usage of employee involvement practices, (2) the degree of organizational investment in employee training and development, and (3) the availability of potential workers. The results demonstrate that employee involvement practices significantly amplify the negative relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance, give marginal support for moderation from the availability of potential workers, and provide no support for moderation from the degree of organizational investment in employee training and development. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of this study for enriching our understanding of the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employees' attitudes toward organizational change: A literature review
Author-Name: Choi, Myungweon
Abstract: Organizations are increasingly required to improve their ability to enhance employees' support or acceptance for change initiatives. In studies that have examined the conditions in which employees support organizational change, researchers have focused on various attitudinal constructs that represent employees' attitudes toward organizational change. The constructs, which frequently serve as key variables in these studies, include readiness for change, commitment to change, openness to change, and cynicism about organizational change. These constructs have distinct meanings and emphases and therefore they can provide us with different information regarding employees' evaluation of and concerns about particular change initiatives. In this literature review, the author discusses how the constructs are defined in the organizational change literature and synthesizes the antecedents of each construct. Based on the discussion, it is proposed that the constructs are susceptible to situational variables, and may change over time as individuals' experiences change; therefore, they are better conceptualized as states than as personality traits. ©2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Socialization has crucial outcomes for both the employee and the employer. Through an exploratory qualitative study conducted in India, we examined how people with disabilities (PWD) viewed various aspects of their socialization process. Specifically, we looked at the role of coworkers, supervisors, organizational practices, and employee proactive behaviors in influencing organizational integration. We found that integration was most influenced by coworkers and supervisors. Organizational practices and employee proactive behaviors were less important. Respondent gender and tenure also influenced certain findings. Specifically, PWD with less tenure sought and accepted more help from coworkers and supervisors. Further, more men with disabilities than women with disabilities indicated that they were proactive in terms of obtaining training to make themselves employable, and more men with disabilities indicated that having coworkers with a disability helped them during socialization. We discuss both theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions based on our findings. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines whether the appointment of women into senior leadership positions has a more positive effect on share price than the appointment of men into equivalent positions. Our dependent variable is the degree of change in share price following the announcement of men and women into senior leadership positions. Although market reactions to corporate events represent a complex process, we argue that changes in stock price represent a barometer for how investors assess the decision's potential effect on a corporation's short- and long-term economic viability. We find a significant spike in stock price following the announcement of women into top leadership positions. The size and direction of change in stock price, however, is moderated by the gender composition of the industry. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A framework for the human resources role in managing culture in mergers and acquisitions
Author-Name: Marks, Mitchell Lee
Author-Name: Mirvis, Philip H.
Abstract: Scholars, business people, and change agents agree that culture matters in eventual merger and acquisition (M&A) success. Researchers have generated many insights and practitioners have developed many interventions regarding culture in M&A. Managing culture, however, is often a low priority when executives are consumed with the deal's financial and strategic aspects. The authors propose a framework for how Human Resources (HR) can work with business partners in managing acculturation in M&A. They first examine the relationship between cultural differences and M&A outcomes, how culture manifests itself in combinations, and the causes and stages of culture clash. They then highlight the value of a clear “cultural endstate” in M&A and apply classic change management theory to identify actions that unfreeze current cultural mind-sets, move people toward the desired endstate, and refreeze the desired culture. Their framework specifies HR actions for four distinct cultural endstates—pluralism (in which the partner companies coexist), integration (in which the partners blend current cultures together), assimilation (in which one company absorbs the other), and transformation (in which the partner companies abandon key elements of their current cultures and adopt new values and norms). © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Cultural clashes in a “merger of equals”: The case of high‐tech start‐ups
Author-Name: Drori, Israel
Author-Name: Wrzesniewski, Amy
Author-Name: Ellis, Shmuel
Abstract: Mergers of equals are often considered simply symbolic. Whereas existing literature on the topic views equality as underscoring the importance of distributive justice, power, or identity, the role of culture remains relatively obscure. In this study, the authors explore equality as a dynamic construct associated with two major processes in mergers of equals: cultural clash and cultural construction. The authors employ a qualitative case study with interviews and analysis of company materials from BroadBand, a wireless Internet access provider, to address the role of culture and equality in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The results shed light on how and why social actors entering into mergers may enact a culture of equality. First, firms may develop new aspirations and patterns of appreciation and initiate practices and strategies that construct equality as an integral part of the merger. Second, when distributive equality becomes a liability, it incites change. In the context of equality, this change results in strategic action that transforms the meaning of “a merger of equals” to a more practical, pragmatic, and integrative equality, which takes into account the interests and the needs of the merged firm. Third, contrary to the common skeptical and cynical portrayal of mergers of equals, this study found equality to be a crucial factor during postmerger integration. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Postacquisition cultural integration in mergers & acquisitions: A knowledge‐based approach
Author-Name: Lakshman, C.
Abstract: The author proposes a knowledge-based theoretical approach to cultural integration in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The model proposed in this article examines the nature and features of the integration process using a knowledge lens to view the cultural and organizational integration mechanism leading to integration effectiveness. Drawing from advances in the acquisition, strategic HRM, knowledge management, and leadership literatures, the model identifies knowledge leadership, cultural knowledge integration, early involvement in integration process design, and variables related to causal ambiguity as key components of an effective set of practices for integration in these contexts. It does so under the rubric of a relational HR archetype for managing knowledge flows. The model explains the processes through which these constructs impact integration effectiveness. The contributions of this approach, limitations, and directions for future theoretical and empirical research are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Trust dynamics in acquisitions: A case survey
Author-Name: Stahl, Günter K.
Author-Name: Larsson, Rikard
Author-Name: Kremershof, Ina
Author-Name: Sitkin, Sim B.
Abstract: Drawing on the organizational trust literature and research on postmerger integration, the authors develop a model that conceptually synthesizes the antecedents and consequences of trust in acquired organizations. The model proposes that the acquiring and target firms' relationship history, the interfirm distance, and the acquirer's integration approach will affect target firm member trust in the acquiring firm's management. Target firm member trust, in turn, may influence several sociocultural integration outcomes as well as postacquisition performance. The results of a case survey suggest that certain aspects of the relationship history and interfirm distance, such as the firms' collaboration history and preacquisition performance differences, are poor predictors of trust, whereas integration process variables, such as speed of integration, communication quality, and acquirer multiculturalism are major factors influencing trust. The implications for postmerger integration research and practice are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Integration managers' value‐capturing roles and acquisition performance
Author-Name: Teerikangas, Satu
Author-Name: Véry, Philippe
Author-Name: Pisano, Vincenzo
Abstract: Although the significance of managing the acquisition process is acknowledged, little evidence exists as to the ways in which managerial action throughout this process impacts acquisition performance. In this article, the researchers draw attention to the central, yet largely neglected figure responsible for implementing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), namely “the integration manager.” Drawing from an extensive study of nine related, friendly acquisitions involving 166 interviews, the authors find that integration managers affect acquisition performance by capturing value derived from (a) the preacquisition phase, (b) the acquiring firm, and (c) the acquired firm. Through their in/;action, integration managers affect two sources of economic performance: the extent of additional value created and the extent of value leaked. The findings contribute to enriching our knowledge of managing the acquisition process and are a call for more actor-based, micro-level studies on the ways in which managing the acquisition process and the actors therein affect acquisition performance. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc

Abstract: The present study examines the effect of the physical work environment on the creativity of knowledge workers, compared with the effects of creative personality and the social-organizational work environment. Based on data from 274 knowledge workers in 27 small and medium-sized enterprises, we conclude that creative personality, the social-organizational work environment, and the physical work environment independently affect creative performance. The relative contribution of the physical work environment is smaller than that of the social-organizational work environment, and both contributions are smaller than that of creative personality. The results give support for human resource practices that focus on the individual, the social-organizational work environment, and the physical work environment in order to enhance knowledge workers' creativity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Unlocking the value of Web 2.0 technologies for training and development: The shift from instructor‐controlled, adaptive learning to learner‐driven, generative learning
Author-Name: London, Manuel
Author-Name: Hall, MJ
Abstract: Traditional instruction is adaptive—that is, instructor-driven, face-to-face and/or online training to teach skills and knowledge and convey information, policies, and procedures. In contrast, generative learning is learner-driven, collaborative, and problem-focused. Web 2.0 technologies can support both types of learning but are especially valuable for generative learning. This article reviews learning processes and Web 2.0 capabilities, describes two case examples, outlines ways to design Web 2.0 training applications, and discusses the changing role of learning professionals from delivering structured, one-way adaptive learning to designing and facilitating generative learning opportunities. The article concludes with ideas for corporate education and research on Web 2.0–based learning processes, including utilizing the technology to track and improve learning. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Distributive justice, procedural justice, exemplarity, and employees' willingness to cooperate in M&A integration processes: An analysis of the Air France‐KLM merger
Author-Name: Melkonian, Tessa
Author-Name: Monin, Philippe
Author-Name: Noorderhaven, Niels G.
Abstract: Although employees' willingness to cooperate is acknowledged as a critical success factor for post-M&A (merger-and-acquisition) integration, we still know little about the psychological mechanisms that lie beneath employees' cooperative attitudes and behaviors in this context. Building on the premises of fairness heuristic theory, this longitudinal study explores how the relative importance of distributive and procedural justice judgments for employees' willingness to cooperate shifts over time. We suggest that when employees lack justice-relevant information on both distributive and procedural aspects of decisions, they will use another temporary heuristic to reduce uncertainty by scrutinizing the M&A-related cooperative behaviors of authority figures. We test our hypotheses on data from a four-time repeated cross-sectional survey of employee responses in a post-M&A integration process. The findings provide important insights into how merging firms can enhance employees' willingness to cooperate through the subtle exercise of justice and exemplarity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Postacquisition evolution of the appraisal and reward systems: A study of Chinese IT firms acquired by US firms
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Author-Name: Huang, Kun
Abstract: This study investigates changes and continuity in the performance appraisal and reward systems of four Chinese IT firms after they were acquired by US-owned multinational corporations. Drawing on different perspectives, it examines changes in the appraisal and reward systems of the acquired units and the extent to which they may be influenced by the interplay of business strategy, organizational structure, resource-based power of the acquiring and acquired partners, management competence, labor market factors, and the cultural norms of China. The study reveals that the guiding principle of performance management and reward policy of the acquired firms have experienced changes. However, the structure of compensation remains largely unchanged. There is a high level of resistance from the Chinese managers to adopt more sophisticated performance appraisal techniques and to widen the wage band to differentiate employees' performance. The foreign acquirers have taken a cautious and pragmatic approach to implement changes. As a result, the relatively slow speed of change and limited substantive changes in the performance and reward practices make it impossible to achieve a full strategic alignment of human resource practices at the corporate-level post-acquisition. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Peer interaction in mergers: Evidence of collective rumination
Author-Name: Marmenout, Katty
Abstract: Following abundant anecdotal evidence of low morale in mergers and its important detrimental effect on postmerger performance, the purpose of this multimethod experimental study was to find out how employee reactions to a merger evolve over time following peer interaction (i.e., discussion with colleagues). Using a scenario study, initial reactions to a merger announcement were compared with socially influenced reactions. As anticipated, an overall strong detrimental effect of peer interaction on employee reactions was observed. Next, findings indicate that deal characteristics (culture clash potential, announced degree of integration, and position in deal structure) play a moderating role. Indeed, how peer interaction affects outcomes depends on the position in the deal structure. Qualitative data analysis of the group discussions sheds light on how employee reactions become more detrimental. This process is conceptualized as “collective rumination,” defined as repetitively and passively discussing organizational problems and their negative consequences with a group of peers. The study concludes with implications for practice and identifies three powerful levers (active involvement, distraction, and positive leadership) to influence the way in which employees react to the event. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The diverse organization: Finding gold at the end of the rainbow
Author-Name: Scott, Kristyn A.
Author-Name: Heathcote, Joanna M.
Author-Name: Gruman, Jamie A.
Abstract: The breadth and depth of research on organizational diversity reveals the complex nature of diversity in organizations. Indeed, research in the realm of human resource management focuses on diversity applied to a variety of topics, including recruitment, retention, succession planning, and work-life management, among others. In this article, we use Cox and Blake's (1991) advantages as a framework to review the diversity literature and suggest that organizational culture may be key to understanding when organizations will benefit from a diverse employee base. Specifically, organizations that emphasize inclusion and integrate diversity into all policies and practices may benefit to a greater extent compared with organizations focusing on diversity as a stand-alone practice. Through an examination of academic research and the award-winning diversity program of Campbell Soup Company (Catalyst, 2010), we make culturally based propositions to further diversity research in, and the practice of, human resource management. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Theory‐driven development of a comprehensive turnover‐attachment motive survey
Author-Name: Maertz, Carl P.
Author-Name: Boyar, Scott L.
Abstract: Recent studies propose a theoretical framework of “eight forces” that purportedly captures all the distinct motives causing voluntary turnover decisions. Based on this framework, we develop the Turnover-Attachment Motive Survey (TAMS) consisting of 18 scales, the most comprehensive model-based turnover antecedent survey to date, facilitating more fully specified research models and more systematic diagnoses of turnover causes. Moreover, findings support behavioral inertia against quitting, psychological dissonance costs of quitting, supervisor continuance attachment, and coworker continuance attachment as significant predictors of turnover behavior for the first time in the literature. Overall, findings do suggest that our 18-scale survey demonstrated adequate psychometric properties to justify its further use and development. We finally discuss the many uses of the TAMS for both turnover researchers and practitioners. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Small is beautiful: Implications of reliability and statistical power for testing the efficacy of HR interventions
Author-Name: Horwitz, Sujin K.
Author-Name: Horwitz, Irwin B.
Abstract: The development of optimal human resource practices is often contingent on the accurate statistical testing of potential interventions. Testing the efficacy of HR interventions can be enhanced by taking additional measures to improve statistical power, but the traditional means of increasing power through sample size are often beyond the cost and ability of HR professionals to pursue. This article, therefore, focuses on measurement procedures as an alternative way to increase statistical power for detecting HR intervention effects. Selection of reliable and appropriate measures and subsequent instrumentation are examined as efficacious and cost-beneficial techniques that can be employed during the planning and designing stage of a study for augmenting statistical power to optimize business decision making. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Kulik, Carol T.

Author-Name: Bordia, Prashant
Abstract: The unfolding model emphasizes the role of shocks (jarring events that initiate exit cognitions) in the turnover process. In contrast to earlier survey-based research, we used exit interviews to classify organizational leavers along the model's paths. The data provide support for the model but highlight several aspects of shocks not addressed by previous research. Employees on the same path may experience distinctly different shock subgroups (e.g., work or nonwork), some employees require shock combinations (e.g., push and pull shocks) to motivate leaving, and some dissatisfied employees experience shock-like events (final straws) that confirm previous exit cognitions rather than initiate them. The research demonstrates how organizations can use exit interviews to better understand their employee exit patterns. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Strategic participation is important for HR professionals who wish to have increased influence in their organizations. While a number of previous studies have suggested a link between strategic human resource management and firm performance, few have explored the specific factors enabling HR strategic participation. This study examines the impact of HR service quality and expectations of HR contributions on HR strategic participation. A total of 244 survey responses were received from 42 companies in Taiwan. All hypotheses were supported, thus signifying significant relationships between HR service quality, expectations of HR contributions, and HR strategic participation. The study results also indicate that HR professionals are able to proactively increase the value of HR in organizations by enhancing HR service quality and addressing potential internal customers' needs accordingly. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Why does firm reputation in human resource policies influence college students? The mechanisms underlying job pursuit intentions
Author-Name: Wayne, Julie Holliday
Author-Name: Casper, Wendy J.
Abstract: Business periodicals, such as Fortune magazine, rank organizations in lists such as the “Best Companies to Work For,” providing applicants with information about firms' human resource practices, including pay, benefits, work-life, and diversity practices. It is not clear what influence this reputational information about HR practices has on applicant interest in pursuing employment or, more important, why it does so. Given that firms invest substantial resources in HR practices to vie for positions on these lists, the current study sought to fill these gaps in the literature. In the 2 (compensation) × 2 (work-family) × 2 (diversity) factorial design, 232 college students read about magazine rankings in which a firm's reputation in each HR practice was manipulated as ranking either high or low relative to competitors. We examined perceptions of organizational prestige, anticipated organizational support, and anticipated role performance as mechanisms that explain the influence of HR practice reputation on job pursuit intentions. Our results indicate that a firm's reputation in compensation, work-family, and diversity efforts increase college students' intentions to pursue employment with a firm. They do so because college students perceive that the organization is prestigious, will be supportive, and will foster their job performance. Our results suggest that a strong employer brand derived from employee-centered HR practices is important for recruiting college students. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Both researchers and managers are increasingly interested in how firms can pursue ambidextrous learning—that is, simultaneously exploring new knowledge domains while exploiting current ones. In this study, we attempt to bring human resource management into this forum by introducing and testing how high-involvement human resource practices shape the social climate that affects the firm's ambidextrous learning and subsequent performance. A field study of 198 companies from Spain showed that high-involvement human resource practices were positively related to the social climate that, in turn, facilitates ambidextrous learning and improved performance. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study investigated the relationship between perceived training intensity and knowledge sharing, including the moderating roles of intrinsic motivation and social and economic exchange perceptions. Data from 310 employees working in three organizations located in Norway revealed a positive relationship between perceived training intensity and knowledge sharing for employees with low levels of intrinsic motivation and economic exchange perception, and high levels of social exchange perception. These findings suggest that perceived training intensity increases knowledge sharing only under specific motivational influences.

Abstract: In this article, the authors used a within-person design to examine the relationship between job insecurity and employee in-role and extra-role performance, and the buffering role of time-varying work-based support (i.e., supervisor and colleague support) in this relationship. Weekly diary data gathered over the course of three weeks from 56 employees confronted with organizational restructuring and analyzed with a hierarchical linear modeling approach showed that weekly fluctuations in job insecurity negatively predicted week-level in-role performance. As predicted, supervisor support moderated the intra-individual relationship between job insecurity and in-role performance, so that employees' in-role performance suffered less from feeling job insecurity during weeks in which they received more support from their supervisor. No relationship between job insecurity and extra-role performance was observed. This within-person study contributes to research on job insecurity that has primarily focused on inter-individual differences in job insecurity and their associations with job performance. Theoretical and practical implications for human resource management are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Training older workers: Lessons learned, unlearned, and relearned from the field of instructional design
Author-Name: Williams van Rooij, Shahron
Abstract: Changing workforce demographics have highlighted the need to provide training and development opportunities for older workers. This article critically examines the current state of research on the use of systematic instructional design procedures to develop work-related training that is inclusive of older workers. The review reveals a disconnect between what the literature recommends to achieve age-inclusive design and what is offered as evidence of age-inclusive design. Age-related generalizations about cognition and learning capacity often serve as the basis for design decisions, with little attention paid to the role of training context and content. The article recommends that this disconnect be resolved and offers some specific suggestions about how human resource managers can integrate sound instructional design principles into the training and development component of their talent management strategies. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Enhancing employee and organizational performance through coaching based on mystery shopper feedback: A quasi‐experimental study
Author-Name: Latham, Gary P.
Author-Name: Ford, Robert C.
Author-Name: Tzabbar, Danny
Abstract: Based on reinforcement theory, a quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of (a) feedback obtained from (b) a relatively neutral third party (namely, mystery shoppers) that was obtained on a (c) variable interval schedule for managers to use to (d) coach their employees. An interrupted time-series design showed that both employee and organizational performance increased as a result of this intervention. Performance dropped when this intervention was cut back and, subsequently, discontinued. These results were replicated in two additional restaurants. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Do conflict management systems matter?
Author-Name: Roche, William
Author-Name: Teague, Paul
Abstract: The most influential current idea in the theory of conflict management concerns the design features and supposed superior outcomes of conflict management systems combining interest-based and rights-based practices for resolving conflict in organizations. Yet much of the literature in the area is highly prescriptive and draws heavily either on exemplary case studies or descriptive data. Using focus groups of HR practitioners and experts in conflict resolution to develop a questionnaire covering the main conflict management practices associated with the theory of conflict management systems, the study analyzes data from a survey of firms in the Republic of Ireland to examine quantitatively the effects of conflict management systems on organizational outcomes. While proactive line management and supervisory engagement in conflict resolution as a key dimension of conflict management systems is found to be positively associated with a range of organizational outcomes, no evidence is found for the kind of system effects proposed in the theoretical and prescriptive literature. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A comparison of adverse impact levels based on top‐down, multisource, and assessment center data: Promoting diversity and reducing legal challenges
Author-Name: John Bernardin, H.
Author-Name: Konopaske, Robert
Author-Name: Hagan, Christine M.
Abstract: We compared levels of adverse impact (AI) against minorities and women based on three promotional decision methods for 428 associate store managers of a Fortune 500 retailer: top-down appraisal (TDA), multisource appraisal (MSA), and an assessment center (AC). We found significant effects for race and minority status (favoring whites) but no significant effects for gender across all three methods. Comparisons were analyzed using two definitions of AI (four-fifths rule and the Fisher Exact Test) with a selection ratio (SR) of .25. No evidence of AI was found against blacks for any of the methods. For Hispanics, AI was found under the four-fifths rule for the AC. For women, the four-fifths rule was violated using TDA. Results provide some partial support for the argument that diversity goals are more likely to be met using assessment centers compared to TDA when the preponderance of raters are white men. Our data also suggest that carefully crafted, job-related, top-down appraisal, combined with rater training, may be effective in facilitating the promotion of more women and minorities and reducing the probability of legal problems. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How to identify leadership potential: Development and testing of a consensus model
Author-Name: Dries, Nicky
Author-Name: Pepermans, Roland
Abstract: Building on two studies, the current article responds to urgent calls in the literature for more empirical research on how to identify leadership potential. Based on an extensive review of the 1986–2010 literature, and applying a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, we developed a model of leadership potential consisting of four quadrants: Analytical skills (containing the factors Intellectual curiosity, Strategic insight, Decision making, and Problem solving); Learning agility (containing the factors Willingness to learn, Emotional intelligence, and Adaptability); Drive (containing the factors Results orientation, Perseverance, and Dedication); and Emergent leadership (containing the factors Motivation to lead, Self-promotion, and Stakeholder sensitivity). Notably, the developed model steers clear from some of the typical issues that tend to hinder valid assessments of leadership potential (i.e., the confound between performance and potential, as well as that between leadership potential and successful, mature leadership). Furthermore, high consensus was found between top managers, line managers, and HR managers about the practical relevance of the proposed model. The article concludes with some specific future avenues for research and practice. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Explaining organizational responsiveness to work‐life balance issues: The role of business strategy and high‐performance work systems
Author-Name: Wang, Jing
Author-Name: Verma, Anil
Abstract: This article applies new insights into business strategies and high-performance work systems (HPWSs) to examine why organizations adopt work-life balance programs (WLBPs). Results indicate that a product leadership business strategy is positively related to the likelihood of adopting WLBPs, whereas a cost leadership business strategy is negatively related to the adoption of these programs. Moreover, our analyses establish a mediating role of HPWSs in the relationship between business strategies and the adoption of WLBPs. Our results also demonstrate that different industries vary in adoption of work-life balance programs. This supports the institutional theory of organizational responsiveness to work-life balance issues. We tested our hypotheses with two waves of the nationally representative Canadian Workplace and Employee Survey. Implications and specific suggestions for human resource practitioners are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The role of leadership in successful international mergers and acquisitions: Why Renault‐Nissan succeeded and DaimlerChrysler‐Mitsubishi failed
Author-Name: Gill, Carol
Abstract: This article compares and contrasts the Renault-Nissan and DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi mergers to consider the relative and combined effects of national and organizational culture on the performance of Nissan and Mitsubishi. It also examines the reasons why the Renault-Nissan merger was successful and the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi merger failed. It finds that Japanese national culture influenced organizational culture and HRM practices, which created organizations that had no sense of urgency, profit orientation, or accountability and led to poor market and financial performance. It also finds that leadership was a major factor impacting on the success of the turnaround efforts of these two organizations. These findings have implications for leaders and human resource management practitioners engaged in international business and are of particular relevance to Western organizations working with organizations in high-context countries with a collectivist rather than individualist orientation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Screening‐oriented recruitment messages: Antecedents and relationships with applicant pool quality
Author-Name: Dineen, Brian R.
Author-Name: Williamson, Ian O.
Abstract: The ability of firms to attract qualified job applicants is a critical component of the human resource management process. However, while a large body of research has examined the relationship between firm recruitment practices and applicant pool attributes, very little research has investigated what factors are associated with organizational decision makers' utilization of specific recruitment tactics. We draw on labor economics, sociological, and agency theoretical perspectives to make predictions regarding the use of screening-oriented recruitment messages in actual web-based job advertisements. Results suggest that perceptions of labor supply, recruiting firm reputation, and the use of quality-based compensation incentives are associated with use of screening-oriented messages, which in turn are associated with applicant pool quality. These findings hold important theoretical insights into the factors shaping firm recruitment activity and provide practical strategic implications for managing firm recruitment objectives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Linking HRM and knowledge transfer via individual‐level mechanisms

Author-Name: Rabbiosi, Larissa
Abstract: In response to recent calls for more research on micro-foundations, we seek to link human resource management (HRM) and knowledge transfer through individual-level mechanisms, arguing that individual-level conditions of action influence the extent to which employees engage in knowledge exchange. We examine four such conditions empirically using data from 811 employees in three Danish multinational corporations (MNCs). Our findings suggest that individual-level perceptions of organizational commitment to knowledge sharing, and extrinsic motivation, directly influence the extent to which employees engage in firm-internal knowledge exchange. We also find that intrinsic motivation and engagement in social interaction significantly mediate the relationship between perceived organizational commitment and knowledge exchange. Given that HRM can influence such conditions through an overall signaling effect and various practices, an understanding of these micro-foundations will shed light on how organizations can effectively enhance knowledge transfer through HRM. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Options‐based HRM, intellectual capital, and exploratory and exploitative learning in law firms' practice groups

Abstract: The current study intends to uncover the strategic contribution of human resource management by introducing a unique construct of options-based (vis-à-vis project-based) HRM and examining its links to intellectual capital and exploratory and exploitative learning in the context of law firms' practice groups. Empirical results show that options-based HRM is positively related to the practice group's explorative and exploitative learning. The intellectual capital mediates the relationships between options-based HRM and the practice group's learning for exploration and exploitation. This study makes a valuable contribution to the HRM literature by establishing the mechanisms by which HRM enables organizational learning and extending the scope of HRM research to professional service firms. Our findings also provide valuable implications for the literature of organizational learning. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: While it is well established that high-performance work systems (HPWSs) affect firm-level outcomes within large, complex organizations, less is known about how they create benefits for firms within the small-business sector. Using a knowledge-creation perspective, this study examines the impact of HPWSs in small and medium enterprises and examines whether the impact observed depends on the small-business leader's capacity to obtain additional HR knowledge from an external expert, as well as the leader's HR background and knowledge. Archival and survey data were obtained from 294 small-business organizations, with survey responses obtained from both the small-business leader and an HR consultant assigned to the small business. Findings suggest that leader perceptions of HR effectiveness are positively related to the use of HPWSs and that this relationship is moderated both by the communication patterns between the small-business leader and the HR consultant assigned to the firm and the small-business leader's HR knowledge. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The effect of context‐specific versus nonspecific subconscious goals on employee performance
Author-Name: Latham, Gary P.
Author-Name: Piccolo, Ronald F.
Abstract: We investigated the effect of context-specific versus general subconscious goals on job performance in a call center. Employees (n = 54) were randomly assigned to a condition where they were primed by (a) a photograph of people making telephone calls in a call center, (b) a woman winning a race, or (c) a control group. Job performance was measured by the (1) number of and (2) monetary value of pledges from donors. None of the participants in the two experimental conditions showed conscious awareness of a prime. Analysis of variance indicated that both a subconscious context-specific and a subconscious general goal aroused the implicit need for achievement as assessed by a projective measure, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Both types of primed goals led to a significant increase in the number of pledges during a four-day workweek. Consistent with goal-setting theory, employees in the context-specific condition raised more money than those in the general achievement (one-tailed t-test) and control (two-tailed t-test) conditions. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Gender diversity in leadership succession: Preparing for the future
Author-Name: Virick, Meghna
Author-Name: Greer, Charles R.
Abstract: The development of gender diversity in leadership positions is a critical need for many companies as they develop strategies for how they will compete in the future. In this article, we test hypotheses about diverse leadership succession, using survey and archival data. Survey data were collected from executives and managers who responded to questions about their succession planning, successors, and the context of diversity in their work environments. Results indicate that the nomination of women as successors was positively associated with more favorable diversity climates for women. Furthermore, we found that the nomination of female successors was positively associated with the performance of incumbent managers who nominated them as their successors. We also found that the performance of incumbent managers moderated the relationship between diversity climate and the nomination of female successors. Lower-performing incumbents were less likely than higher-performing incumbents to nominate women as successors when the diversity climate was unfavorable. When the diversity climate was favorable, lower performers were more likely and higher performers were equally likely to nominate women as successors. We found no differences in the degree of objectivity in incumbents' descriptions of the strengths of female successors versus their male counterparts or in the degree of subjectivity in their developmental needs. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Companies increasingly make use of geographically dispersed teams to capture knowledge residing at different locations. In this context, shared leadership is considered a key enabler of team performance. Taking a functional perspective on shared leadership, we thus investigate the relationship between shared leadership behaviors and team performance in dispersed teams. Furthermore, we analyze how socio-demographic factors that are characteristic for dispersed teams (i.e., high female-to-male ratio, high mean age, and high levels of national diversity) affect shared leadership behaviors. Based on data from 96 dispersed teams, we show that shared leadership behavior fosters team performance. Further, we find the socio-demographic characteristics typical for dispersed teams to foster shared leadership. Theoretical and managerial implications for human resource management are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Reverse mentoring at work: Fostering cross‐generational learning and developing millennial leaders
Author-Name: Marcinkus Murphy, Wendy
Abstract: Reverse mentoring is an innovative way to encourage learning and facilitate cross-generational relationships. It involves the pairing of a younger, junior employee acting as mentor to share expertise with an older, senior colleague as mentee. The purpose is knowledge sharing, with the mentee focused on learning from the mentor's updated subject or technological expertise and generational perspective. In addition, there is an emphasis on the leadership development of the mentors. Reverse mentoring is situated in the mentoring literature as an alternative form of mentoring, with unique characteristics and support functions exchanged that distinguish it from other developmental relationships. A model is developed that focuses on key variables to consider and how reverse mentoring may benefit individuals and organizations. Generational differences are also presented, and the ways in which reverse mentoring capitalizes on millennial capabilities and preferences are highlighted throughout. Finally, theoretical and practical contributions are discussed, including essential components for creating a reverse mentoring program. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Results provide support for negative effects of the extent of RPO on graduates' satisfaction with the recruitment process and company attractiveness. More-over, mediated by graduates' satisfaction with the recruitment process and company attractiveness, an increasing extent of RPO negatively influences job-acceptance intentions. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Merriman, Kimberly K.
Author-Name: Sen, Sagnika
Abstract: Research to date has identified CEO pay structure as an important factor in the environmental and social performance of the organization but has not considered how pay may influence these sustainability efforts at the middle-management level. We address this void with an experimental manipulation of direct and indirect pay incentives for an environmental sustainability project and production cost savings project. Counter to our predictions, investment in sustainability versus cost savings is significantly lower when incentives for both projects are equivalent, and investment is only comparable when incentives for the sustainability project are superior. Further investigation using qualitative data attributes this to differences in the salient social norms that individuals hold and an apparent undervaluing of the indirect incentive derived through sustainability's contribution to cost savings. The results shed light on primary ways in which human resource management practices may be used to embed support for sustainability initiatives throughout the organization.

Title: Mothers' psychological contracts: Does supervisor breach explain intention to leave the organization?
Author-Name: Botsford Morgan, Whitney
Author-Name: King, Eden B.
Abstract: Recent evidence suggests mothers with infants are leaving the workforce (Cohany & Sok, 2007; Johnson, 2007), but research has not yet clarified why mothers make such a decision. The current research proposes that mothers form psychological contracts including content related to family that supervisors do not fulfill, resulting in intention to leave the organization. In a study of first-time mothers, participants reported experiencing contract breach. Findings also suggested supervisors may have an opportunity to control the outcomes of breach and retain mothers by effectively managing perceptions of fair treatment (i.e., interactional justice). This is the first empirical research to indicate that mothers' intentions to leave depend on fulfillment of their psychological contracts related to family and fair treatment from their supervisor.

Title: Discretionary and transactional human resource practices and employee outcomes: The role of perceived organizational support
Author-Name: Gavino, Monica C.

Author-Name: Erdogan, Berrin
Abstract: Utilizing perceived organizational support (POS) as the mechanism linking HR practices to employee behaviors in the workplace, we examine a broad set of HR practices in order to understand the relative importance of each HR practice (i.e., those that explain incremental variance over other practices) in influencing employee behaviors. We differentiate between discretionary and transactional HR practices to test the discretionary investment requisite of POS theory. The results show that of the eight discretionary practices, only participation and decision making directly influenced the extra-role behaviors that employees exhibit, and only training and development directly impacted the customer-oriented behaviors. Furthermore, one of the transactional HR practices was found to have a direct effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Our findings indicate that the performance management process, promotional opportunities, participation, and involvement in decision making affect how employees behave toward the customer and the extra-role behaviors they exhibit. Furthermore, this occurs through the view employees develop of the organization as a place to work. That is, these four HR practices demonstrate to employees that they are valued, and, in turn, this feeling of being appreciated impacts their commitment to delivering high-quality service to the customer and going beyond their job responsibilities. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Perceived supervisor support climate, perceived investment in employee development climate, and business‐unit performance
Author-Name: Dysvik, Anders
Author-Name: Kuvaas, Bård
Abstract: Perceived supervisor support (PSS) has been found to predict employee in-role and extra-role performance at the individual level of analysis. With respect to the unit level of analysis, the research on the predictive role of PSS remains limited. In particular, calls have been made for research on the role of leadership in facilitating perceived HR practices at the business-unit level and on the role of line managers as implementers of such systems. In response to such calls, this study investigated the associations between PSS climate, perceived investment in employee development (PIED) climate, and business-unit performance among 75 gas stations located in Norway. The results showed that the PSS climate was positively related to both the PIED climate and the business-unit performance. This study contributes to research on PSS by extending the prior findings at the individual level to the unit level of analysis. Also, the study contributes to the research on perceived HR practices by demonstrating the facilitative role of the PSS climate. Finally, the study contributes to the research on shared perceptions of HR practices generally and the concept of the “strength” of the HRM system in particular. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Performance implications of knowledge and competitive arousal in times of employee mobility: “The immutable law of the ex”
Author-Name: Pazzaglia, Federica
Author-Name: Flynn, Scott
Author-Name: Sonpar, Karan
Abstract: This article elaborates on extant literature on employee mobility by focusing on how the movement of personnel between competitors affects their competitive positions. Our mixed-methods study of 402 head-to-head encounters from the English Premier League (2000–2005) reveals that transferred players improve the performance of the recipient team in head-to-head encounters against the donor. We also provide evidence that competitive arousal, as triggered by anger and pressures for proving loyalty to the recipient organization, as well as knowledge of the donor team's routines, explain the superior performance of transferred players. These results question the traditional view that organizational routines are not transferable through employee mobility.

Title: A reexamination of the web‐based job demand for PHR and SPHR certifications in the United States

Author-Name: Meyers, Aaron J.
Abstract: Over the past decade, the exponential growth in Professional in Human Resources (PHR) and Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR) certifications awarded by the Human Resource Certification Institute substantiates the need to reexamine the base rate of HR job announcements that require or prefer such certification. Based on a sample of Web-based job announcements in 2002, Aguinis, Michaelis, and Jones (2005) reported that only 1.4 percent required or preferred PHR/SPHR certification. Using a similar design, the current study found that 15.6 percent of job announcements required or preferred PHR/SPHR certification, which is nearly 11 times the rate found in the Aguinis et al. (2005) study. Results also suggested the demand for PHR/SPHR certification was positively related to experience, educational level, and job title level, with the base rate reaching 25.1 percent for managerial HR roles.

Title: Transfer of training: Written self‐guidance to increase self‐efficacy and interviewing performance of job seekers
Author-Name: Shantz, Amanda
Author-Name: Latham, Gary P.
Abstract: Subsequent to training IT professionals ( n = 35) in skills for performing effectively in a selection interview, 16 were randomly assigned to a transfer of training intervention, written self-guidance (WSG). This methodology is based on social cognitive and self-persuasion theories. The results showed that WSG resulted in significantly higher ratings from an interviewer than did those in the control group. Self-efficacy for interviewing skill mediated the relationship between WSG and performance. A content analysis of the WSG letters showed that the use of self-affirming and self-relevant statements was positively related to performance in the selection interview. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of servant leadership as perceived by followers on their work-to-family enrichment (WFE) by focusing on the mediating role of organizational identification and the moderating role of work climate for sharing family concerns. The results from a field survey of 230 married managers in China provide full support for our hypotheses, indicating that perceived servant leadership is positively related to WFE; this relationship is also mediated by organizational identification. In addition, work climate for sharing family concerns attenuates the effects of servant leadership on organizational identification and WFE. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The social context of performance appraisal and appraisal reactions: A meta‐analysis
Author-Name: Pichler, Shaun
Abstract: This study reviews and meta-analyzes the literature on the social context of performance appraisal. Results indicate that aspects of rater-ratee relationship quality (i.e., supervisor satisfaction, supervisor support, supervisor trust) are strongly related to ratee reactions to performance appraisals. Rater-ratee relationship quality is more strongly related to appraisal reactions than appraisal participation or performance ratings. Integrating social exchange theory with procedural justice theory, this article tested whether or not the relationship quality–appraisal reactions relationship was due to relationships between relationship quality and instrumental resources for the ratee (i.e., appraisal participation and rating favorability). When controlling for relationships between these resources and appraisal reactions, a direct path between relationship quality and reactions was significant, supporting a relational model of the exchange between appraisal partners. The relationship quality–appraisal reaction relationship was not moderated by performance rating favorability or appraisal participation. In total, these results highlight the importance of relationship quality to employee reactions to performance appraisal—and the importance of ratee reactions as an important resource in the social exchange between appraisal partners. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: High‐involvement work practices and environmental capabilities: How HIWPS create environmentally based sustainable competitive advantages
Author-Name: Martínez‐del‐Río, Javier
Author-Name: Céspedes‐Lorente, José
Author-Name: Carmona‐Moreno, Eva
Abstract: We study how high-involvement work practices (HIWPs) may enhance a firm's economic performance through the development of a proactive environmental strategy (PES). HIWP systems facilitate the implementation of a PES by promoting employees' ability, motivation, and opportunities to behave in ways consistent with environmental management goals. In turn, PESs contribute to the development of strategic competitive advantages and drive superior performance. The results of our empirical analysis of 233 firms broadly confirm our hypotheses and suggest that although the direct effect of HIWPs on performance was not signifi cant in our sample, HIWPs do have a significant indirect effect through a PES as a mediator.

Author-Name: Stahl, Günter K.
Abstract: In this article, we discuss how the human resource development (HRD) function can support corporate sustainability strategy by designing and implementing leadership development programs incorporating international service learning assignments. We describe “Project Ulysses,” an integrated service learning program that involves sending participants in teams to developing countries to work in cross-sector partnerships with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and social entrepreneurs, supporting them in their fight against pressing global problems. We present the findings of a narrative analysis of learning stories produced by Ulysses participants. Understanding how participants make sense of, and learn from, their experiences abroad provides us with insights into how service learning programs can help managers to develop the knowledge, skills, and mind-set that will enable them to successfully support a company's global sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts. We conclude by discussing the implications for leadership development, specifically how organizations can incorporate a responsibility and sustainability focus in their management development programs.

Title: Human resource management and developing proactive environmental strategies: The influence of environmental training and organizational learning
Author-Name: Vidal‐Salazar, María Dolores
Author-Name: Cordón‐Pozo, Eulogio
Author-Name: Ferrón‐Vilchez, Vera
Abstract: The need to implement advanced approaches to protect the environment is forcing companies to refocus their internal procedures and actions. To match employees' capabilities and the organization itself to these new requirements, the human resource management department can offer some key tools. This article analyzes whether environmental training (ET) and organizational learning (OL) positively influence the development of proactive environmental strategies (PESs) and compares the two processes, which differ in the time, costs, and difficulty required to implement them. Companies in the tourism sector are currently facing a highly dynamic environment where innovativeness is a decisive factor for achieving competitiveness. As such, we analyze whether the presence or absence of innovativeness influences the development of these two mechanisms. Using a sample of 252 tourism companies, we tested these relationships using structural equation modeling. The findings showed that (1) innovativeness is an antecedent of implementing ET and OL in the companies sampled, (2) both mechanisms promote implementing PESs, and (3) ET is equally as effective as OL for this purpose. Managers should take these findings into account when deciding which mechanism to apply when striving to achieve environmental proactivity.

Abstract: This article examines the role played by line managers in the link between HRM practices and individual performance outcomes. Drawing on social exchange theory, the authors test a mediated model linking perceived line manager behavior and perceived human resource management practices with employee engagement and individual performance. The study focuses on two self-report measures of individual performance; task performance and innovative work behavior. Two studies with a total of 1,796 participants were conducted in service-sector organizations in the United Kingdom and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The data reveal that perceived line manager behavior and perceived HRM practices are linked with employee engagement. In turn, employee engagement is strongly linked to individual performance and fully mediates the link between both perceived HRM practices and perceived line manager behavior and self-report task performance (study 1), as well as self-report innovative work behavior (study 2). The findings show the significance of the line manager in the HRM-performance link, and the mediating role played by employee engagement. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study considers workplace ostracism as a source of stress and examines its spillover effects on the family. By integrating the work-family interface model with boundary theory, we investigate the impact of workplace ostracism as perceived by employees on their family satisfaction by examining the mediating role of work-to-family conflict and the moderating role of work-home segmentation preferences. The results from a three-wave field survey of 233 employees in China indicate that workplace ostracism is negatively related to family satisfaction; this relationship is also mediated by work-to-family conflict. In addition, work-home segmentation preferences attenuate the mediating effect of work-to-family conflict on the relationship between workplace ostracism and family satisfaction. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

Abstract: This article presents two studies that examine whether leader supportive behaviors facilitate knowledge sharing and employee creative problem-solving capacity, thereby enhancing creative performance. The findings from both studies indicate that leader supportive behaviors are directly and indirectly related, through both internal and external knowledge sharing, to employee creative problem-solving capacity. In addition, creative problem solving was related to the two dimensions of creative performance—fluency and originality. However, a test of the mediation model indicated that creative problem solving only mediated the relationship between internal knowledge sharing creative performance and originality. These findings highlight the complex process by which leaders facilitate both internal and external knowledge sharing and employee creative problem-solving capacity, thereby improving employee creative performance.

Abstract: Previous research on employee-turnover intention has focused mostly on a single level of analysis. This multilevel study of 1,149 employees and 144 managers from a 21-store Taiwanese retail home improvement chain demonstrated that individual and store-level factors were significantly associated with employee-turnover intention. Job characteristics explain within-store variance. In addition to age and tenure similarity among employees, transformational leadership and compensation explain between-store variance. Theoretical and practical implications of the research are also discussed.

Abstract: While strategic human resource management (SHRM) theory has largely supported the importance of “fit,” the empirical research evidence has been mixed. In this study, we employ an ethnographic, case-study approach to provide a more comprehensive assessment of fit and consider key contextual factors influencing HRM in the organization. Our findings suggest that the misalignment of HR practices can produce conflicting signals for employees, leading to reduced motivation and commitment. Furthermore, our study suggests that attempts to adopt isolated best practices without sufficient consideration of fit can have negative consequences. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications.

Abstract: Extant literature on diversity training programs continues to yield little evidence of their overall effectiveness. Whereas the most common approach to diversity training entails justifying the value of diversity on the basis of its contribution to the organization's bottom line, we argue that approaching diversity training from an ethical perspective may bolster the effectiveness of traditional approaches. Specifically, to the degree that traditional bottom-line justifications are enhanced with social justice arguments, training effectiveness will increase. In the following article, we discuss traditional approaches to diversity training, provide a general overview of ethics, discuss how theory and research from behavioral ethics literature might help to address some of the challenges faced in diversity training, and draw from ethics literature to make specific, novel suggestions about the implementation and presentation of diversity training.

Title: Employee Responses to Changing Aspects of the Employer Brand Following a Multinational Acquisition: A Longitudinal Study
Author-Name: Edwards, Martin R.
Author-Name: Edwards, Tony
Abstract: This study examines changing employment brands in the context of a multinational acquisition, specifically the implications for current employees. Using a sample (N = 251) from both the acquired and acquiring workforces, employees are tracked across 12 months following acquisition. The study explores predictors of identification with the acquiring organization, intent to quit, and discretionary effort. We focus on employment brand–related predictors, specifically perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences, organizational identity strength, perceived prestige, and judgments of whether the acquiring organization acts in accordance with its corporate identity claims. The study showed that perceptions of prestige immediately after acquisition predict identification 12 months hence, as do judgments of whether the organization acts in accordance with its corporate social responsibility–based corporate identity claims. These judgments also predict subsequent levels of discretionary effort and long-term intent to leave, as do perceptions linked to the provision of unique employment experiences. Perceived change in these unique employment experiences is also related to change in identification and intent to leave across time. Importantly, these elements have a varied effect on the adjustment outcomes when comparing the two workforces.

Abstract: In this study, the authors examine the effects of commitment-based human resource management practices on the performance of small businesses. These effects are examined through the mediators of employee involvement and quit rates. In addition, they contribute to arguments that the effect of human resource management practices on performance takes place through the establishment and support of exchange relationships with employees. Using responses from CEOs and employees of small businesses, their results indicate that human resource practices in small businesses that are based on leaders' views of employee commitment are positively related to revenue growth and perceptions of performance. Further, the authors found that employee involvement and quit rates mediate these relationships.

Abstract: Organizations must target talented applicants, who will often be demographically diverse, to attract the most competent and competitive workforce possible. Despite the bottom-line implications of attracting the best and brightest, surprisingly little is known about how and why diversity recruitment strategies affect recruitment outcomes (e.g., job-pursuit intentions). To gain insight into this question, we conducted an initial experimental study (N = 194) to test the premise that other-group orientation moderates the relationship between perceived organizational value of diversity and job-pursuit intentions. In a follow-up experiment (N = 255), identity affirmation was examined as the mediating mechanism for the interaction observed in the first study. Mediated moderation analyses supported the proposed model. Collectively, the studies indicate that job seekers high in other-group orientation are more intent on pursuing employment with organizations deemed to value diversity because they feel that their salient identities are likely to be affirmed. No such indirect effect is present for those lower in other-group orientation.

Abstract: In this article, we examine the effect of talent identification on employee attitudes. Building on social exchange theory, we analyze the association between employees' perceptions about whether or not they have been formally identified as “talent” and the following attitudinal outcomes: commitment to increasing performance demands, building skills, and supporting strategic priorities; identification with the unit and the multinational enterprise; and turnover intentions. Our analyses of 769 managers and professionals in nine Nordic multinational corporations reveal a number of differences between employees who perceive that they have been identified as “talent” and those who either perceive that they have not been identified or do not know whether they have been identified. We found only limited differences between the two latter categories.

Abstract: This study examines the demographic, economic, and psychographic characteristics of 324 blue-collar workers who were offered four options for either retirement or severance from the organization. Consistent with previous research, individuals who accepted retirement options have more organizational tenure and believed that the packages would provide stable financial futures. A key finding for those who accepted the nonretirement options is that comparable employment would be available. The study concludes with research limitations and suggestions for future research.

Abstract: Complementing previous research that showed a positive effect of general human resource management (HRM) systems on general firm performance, this article undertakes an integrative approach to compare the main effects and examine the interaction effects of two particular HRM systems on influencing firm innovation and performance. Using data from 179 organizations in China, we found that both the commitment-oriented system, which emphasized internal cohesiveness, and the collaboration-oriented system, which was intended to build external connections, contributed to firm innovation and, subsequently, bottom-line performance. We also found an attenuated interaction between the two HRM systems in predicting firm innovation. We employed a mediated-moderation path model to extricate the relationships. Results suggested that organizations that implemented both HRM systems to promote innovation might face ambidexterity challenges. Ideas for future research and practical implications are discussed.

Title: The Link Between Diversity and Equality Management Practice Bundles and Racial Diversity in the Managerial Ranks: Does Firm Size Matter?

Abstract: Invoking strategic human resource management (SHRM) theory and tenets of the resource-based view of the firm, we explore how two bundles of diversity and equality management (DEM) practices influence racial diversity in the managerial ranks. By considering the conceptualization of DEM practices and the moderating role of firm size, our study disentangles subtle nuances in the DEM practices–racial diversity in managerial ranks relationship. Based on a sample of 137 Fortune 1,000 firms over a two-year period, our results suggest that minority opportunity-based DEM practices and manager accountability DEM practices positively relate to racial diversity in managerial ranks, and these relationships are stronger in smaller companies than large ones. Theoretical and practical implications for a strategic perspective on future diversity management research are elaborated.

Title: Promoting Effective Psychological Contracts Through Leadership: The Missing Link Between HR Strategy and Performance
Author-Name: McDermott, Aoife M.

Author-Name: Flood, Patrick C.
Abstract: This article offers line managers and HR professionals an actionable, research-based framework for developing psychological contracts with employees that suit their organizational and human resource (HR) strategy. Leadership styles supporting the firm's HR strategy are key to making psychological contracts that benefit both the firm and its members. When managers' styles are out of sync with HR strategy, this mismatch can lead to poorer performance through ineffective and unfulfilled psychological contracts with workers.

Title: Who Will We Recruit? Targeting Deep‐ and Surface‐Level Diversity with Human Resource Policy Advertising
Author-Name: Casper, Wendy J.

Author-Name: Manegold, Jennifer Grace
Abstract: Research on targeted recruitment has focused on targeting applicants with surface-level attributes such as underrepresented demographic groups. The present study extends targeted recruitment research by examining how advertising human resource policies might be useful for targeting both surface- and deep-level attributes. Specifically, the current study uses an experimental design to examine the impact of work-family, diversity, and employee development policies on the job-pursuit intentions of working adults in the United States. We examined surface- (demographic characteristics; e.g., race) and deep-level differences (attitudes or values; e.g., diversity values) as predictors of whether participants intend to pursue jobs with firms advertising these human resource (HR) policies. Deep-level differences consistently predicted job-pursuit intentions for all three HR policies, but only marginal support was obtained for surface-level variables as predictors. Findings suggest that targeted recruitment based on deep-level attributes may be more successful than targeted recruitment based on surface-level factors.

Title: The Dimensions of Expatriate Adjustment
Author-Name: Haslberger, Arno
Author-Name: Brewster, Chris
Author-Name: Hippler, Thomas
Abstract: A narrow and partial theoretical base has limited current concepts of expatriate adjustment and the research based upon them. This conceptual article explores one of the less theorized aspects of expatriate adjustment: the fact that it has multiple dimensions. We conceive of adjustment as a person-environment relationship that takes place in the three dimensions of cognitions, feelings, and behaviors. Combining these elements takes us one step closer to a comprehensive and more realistic understanding of the nature of expatriate adjustment. We include suggestions for future research that follow from our reconceptualization.

Title: The Reciprocal Relations of Pressure, Work/Family Interference, and Role Satisfaction: Evidence from a Longitudinal Study in Taiwan
Author-Name: Lu, Luo
Author-Name: Kao, Shu‐Fang
Abstract: The aim of this longitudinal study was to explore reciprocal relationships between work/family pressure, work/family interference, and work/family satisfaction among Taiwanese employees (N = 310). All study variables were assessed three times. We found that within the work domain, earlier work pressure caused later work-to-family conflict (WFC), while earlier WFC reduced later job satisfaction. We also found that earlier WFC caused later work pressure, while earlier job satisfaction reduced later WFC. Similarly, we found that within the family domain, earlier family pressure caused later family-to-work conflict (FWC), while earlier FWC reduced later family satisfaction. We also found that earlier FWC caused later family pressure. In addition, family pressure and family satisfaction had reciprocal relationships over time. Together these longitudinal and reciprocal relations strongly support our hypothesized feedback loops linking pressure, work and family conflict, and role satisfaction, within each of the work and family domains. We made specific suggestions on breaking these vicious cycles to effectively manage both the work and family roles.

Abstract: The present study examined employee-involvement climate (i.e., information-sharing and decision-making climate) as a moderator of the relationship between pay-level satisfaction and employee outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, affective commitment, and turnover intention). Survey data were collected from 22,662 Belgian employees, representing 134 organizations. The hypotheses derived from distributive justice theory and from research on the meaning of pay received partial support. Multilevel analyses revealed that a decision-making climate buffered the negative effects of low pay-level satisfaction, and that an information-sharing climate exacerbated the negative effects of low pay-level satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of this differential moderating effect are discussed.

Author-Name: Gatenby, Mark
Abstract: We theorized that absence from work is a resource-based process that is related to perceived meaningfulness of work, well-being, and engagement. Broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) and engagement theory (Bakker, Schaufeli, Leiter, & Taris, 2008; Kahn, 1990) were used to develop a framework for explaining absence. Results of a study of 625 employees and human resource records of subsequent absenteeism data for a three-month period supported our hypotheses that meaningful work increases engagement with work, and that engagement is associated with low levels of absenteeism. Furthermore, data showed that engagement fully mediated the relationship between meaningfulness and absence, and that well-being strengthened the relationship between meaningfulness and engagement. The results have implications for understanding the role of individual-level resources in the workplace, and how meaningfulness, well-being, and engagement influence absence.

Title: Tournament Compensation Systems, Employee Heterogeneity, and Firm Performance
Author-Name: Backes‐Gellner, Uschi
Author-Name: Pull, Kerstin
Abstract: Tournament compensation systems are widely used in practice and have been extensively analyzed theoretically. However, one major problem has hardly been studied in a company context so far: Although it is theoretically well understood that tournament compensation systems are only effective when employees are homogeneous, it has rarely been analyzed what companies can do when they are confronted with employee heterogeneity. In our article, we derive hypotheses on the performance effects of tournament compensation systems in a context of employee heterogeneity based on tournament and expectancy theory. Using personnel records from incentive travel contests, we are able to show that performance is lower in a situation with employee heterogeneity, but that in heterogeneous tournaments, incentives may still work for a subgroup of employees whom we term the “threshold group.” In addition, we also show how companies manage to design the information disclosure systems necessary to install effective “handicapping” or “league-building” systems in order to increase the effort-performance expectancy.

Abstract: We want to create a new narrative about the human resource (HR) profession. HR professionals have often been plagued with self-doubts, repeatedly re-exploring HR's role, value, and competencies. If HR is to fully (and finally) become a profession, these self-doubts need to be replaced with informed insights. These informed insights should be based more on global data than personal perceptions so that the emerging narrative for the HR profession has both substance and meaning.

Title: Firm Productivity Moderated Link Between Human Capital and Compensation: The Significance of Task‐Specific Human Capital
Author-Name: Schulz, Eric
Author-Name: Chowdhury, Sanjib
Author-Name: Van de Voort, David
Abstract: The human capital of a firm as manifested by employee knowledge and experience represents a key resource of a firm's capabilities. Prior empirical studies have found that firms composed of high levels of human capital experience superior firm performance. Human capital theory proposes that an individual's general or firm-specific human capital is positively related to compensation. However, empirical studies examining firm-specific human capital's association with higher employee compensation have been inconclusive. The current study proposes that firm-specific human capital be categorized as task-specific and non-task-specific. Employees accumulate task-specific human capital through duties conducted in their current position. Non-task-specific human capital represents experiences gained in prior positions to an employee's current job within the firm. Utilizing human capital data from 38,390 employees representing 76 firms in the IT sector, this study examines the association between forms of human capital and employee compensation at different levels of firm productivity. Results show that task-specific human capital is associated with higher employee compensation. In addition, firm productivity moderates this association.

Title: The Effect of Relational and Team Characteristics on Individual Performance: A Social Network Perspective
Author-Name: Carboni, Inga
Author-Name: Ehrlich, Kate
Abstract: Increasingly, researchers in human resource management are recognizing the impact of relational characteristics of work design on performance outcomes. In particular, complex task interdependencies associated with loosely structured teams call for an approach to work design that incorporates interpersonal relationships and informal communication to help individuals adapt to changing demands. Taking a social network perspective, we propose that position in the structure of informal communication networks shapes the opportunities and constraints to action for individuals and determines their informal roles. We present a multilevel model in which the relationship between position within a social structure and individual performance was examined within the context of team performance and team tenure. Hypotheses were tested using network data collected from nearly 300 employees in 30 sales teams. Results indicated that individuals close to the core of a team outperformed more peripheral individuals, but only to the extent that teams were high-performing or had been together longer as a team. The article concludes with a general discussion of the implications for HR theory and practices targeted at improving individual performance outcomes.

Title: Psychological Contracts and Informal Networks in Organizations: The Effects of Social Status and Local Ties
Author-Name: Dabos, Guillermo E.
Author-Name: Rousseau, Denise M.
Abstract: Informal social networks in organizations shape how employees understand their employment relationship. Networks can aid or undercut HR efforts to promote psychological contracts that benefit both employees and the employer. Data collected from 96 university faculty members demonstrate that network influence from both social status in the organization's larger informal structure and local ties with socially proximate colleagues shape psychological contract beliefs. Specific effects, however, vary by type of contract term. When contract terms involve resources employees compete for (e.g., opportunities for career advancement), effects are found for social status, such that those who are better positioned in the advice network hold more positive beliefs regarding the extent of the employer commitment. When contract terms involve noncompetitive resources broadly available to all employees (e.g., concern for employee well-being), network effects reveal comparable beliefs between those who share a direct friendship tie (cohesion) or the same friends in common with other faculty members (structural equivalence). Implications for research and HR practice are discussed.

Title: A Social Network Approach to Peer Assessment: Improving Predictive Validity
Author-Name: Luria, Gil
Author-Name: Kalish, Yuval
Abstract: Our premise is that the simple measure used in peer assessment (i.e., number of peer nominations) does not capture the complexity of social information processing and therefore has limited predictive validity. Based on indicators derived from social network analysis and social information processing theories, we suggest new measures (nominations-by-nominees and nominations-not-returned) to enhance the predictive validity of peer assessment. We then compare the validity of existing measures with ours, using a longitudinal sample of 249 soldiers, divided into 18 groups. The soldiers first assessed each other on friendly behavior and instrumental contribution to the team. More than six months later, the commanders of the 132 soldiers in the unit under review provided evaluations of their performance in regard to stress, engagement, and leadership. We found that our new, complex measures predicted performance above and beyond the traditional measure. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

Author-Name: Soltis, Scott M.

Author-Name: Labianca, Giuseppe (Joe)
Abstract: Organizations are increasingly concerned about retaining human talent, particularly within knowledge-based industries where turnover is expensive. Our study employs a social network perspective to explore the influence of employees' formal and informal workplace relationships on their turnover intentions. We do this in a life sciences organization experiencing employee turnover at over twice the rate of the industry average. Drawing on extant work on the effects of distributive justice at work, we argue that employees who are heavily sought out for advice see themselves as being under-rewarded for the time and effort that goes into providing advice, thus increasing turnover intentions. Additionally, we argue that employees see the ability to seek out advice as a form of social support that embeds them into the organization and decreases intention to quit. By exploring the network positions of individuals in the workflow and advice networks, we demonstrate that when employees are either providing advice to someone they are obligated to work with or are able to seek out advice from others who are not required to work with them, the relationship with turnover intentions is most intense. We conclude by discussing contributions to the theory and practice of human resource management.

Author-Name: Chen, Yang
Abstract: Recognizing that managing the outsourcing relationship is critical to the success of a human resource outsourcing (HRO) strategy, we draw on two theoretical perspectives in social network research, integrating open- and closed-triad network structures, to develop a balanced HRO network framework through the moderating impact of HR interdependence. We use this framework to identify the relationships among the HR department that outsources certain HR functions, the groups of internal employees served by the HRO programs, and HR service vendors providing these outsourced HR services. We also consider strategies on how to manage HRO relationship structure to achieve competitive advantage in HR practice. The present study is an attempt to advance the HRO literature from a focus on a “make or buy” decision to a broader model of HRO relationship management.

Title: Developing Organizational Social Capital or Prima Donnas in MNEs? The Role of Global Leadership Development Programs
Author-Name: Espedal, Bjarne
Author-Name: Gooderham, Paul N.
Author-Name: Stensaker, Inger G.
Abstract: The aim of this article is to identify those aspects of global leadership development (GLD) programs that promote social capital and knowledge sharing in multinational enterprises (MNEs). The analysis is conducted within the context of two Scandinavian MNEs. Both MNEs had aimed at the development of inter-unit social networks and knowledge sharing. In the one program, participants bonded with other participants while remaining socially embedded in their business units of origin. As a consequence, bridging social capital was developed, and knowledge sharing across the MNE increased. For the other program, despite apparent similarities in design and goals, we found the reverse. In addition to differences in the selection mechanisms employed by the two programs, our research identified contrasting modes of organizing the in-program learning processes and dissimilarities in the roles played by top management and GLD consultants during the programs. Overall, while the one program was congruent with the Scandinavian corporate culture context, the other was at odds with it, and instead of developing social capital it turned out prima donnas. We argue that MNEs aiming to use GLD programs for developing social capital across their operations must be highly sensitive to the issue of congruence with the established corporate culture.

Title: Predicting Retirement Upon Eligibility: An Embeddedness Perspective
Author-Name: Bamberger, Peter A.
Author-Name: Bacharach, Samuel B.
Abstract: Concern over the impact of baby-boomers' retirement on needed skills and proprietary knowledge has stimulated an interest in identifying workplace factors associated with retirement upon eligibility. Drawing from embeddedness theory, the authors identify work-based antecedents potentially underlying a related, but distinct, form of withdrawal—retirement upon eligibility. The authors generate and test hypotheses regarding the impact of fit-, sacrifice-, and links-related antecedents using a prospective study design and a national probability sample of some 500 older individuals who, at the time of the initial interview, were within months of becoming—for the first time—eligible to receive such benefits. The findings indicate that, beyond the effects of person-based antecedents (e.g., age, health, assets, expected retirement income), a combination of fit- (i.e., job challenge), sacrifice- (i.e., perceived organizational support), and links-related factors (i.e., stability of close workplace peer relations) have a substantial influence on the decision to retire upon eligibility. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The interests of organizations and unions are often seen to be in competition. However, the union-voice hypothesis suggests that unions can provide a distinctive mechanism to lower organizational costs by reducing exit behavior. This study looks at union citizenship behavior as a form of voice and examines its effect on employee absence. It draws on data from 367 branches of a large unionized banking organization to explore both the antecedents and outcomes of union citizenship behavior. Union citizenship behavior directed toward helping fellow members with workplace grievances was found to reduce branch-level absenteeism, while union loyalty mediated the impact of a number of union-related variables on union citizenship behavior. The implications for a balanced union-management relationship are discussed in the article. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Foreign Direct Investment from Emerging Markets to Africa: The HRM Context
Author-Name: Wood, Geoffrey
Author-Name: Mazouz, Khelifa

Author-Name: Cheah, Jeremy Eng‐Tuck
Abstract: In this article, we explore what determines the decisions of emerging-market multinational corporations (MNCs) to invest in Africa and whether this is any different from their counterparts in mature markets, focusing on the HRM context. More specifically, we explore the effect of potential host-country wages, local capabilities, and the relative rights of owners versus workers on foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions, as well as other relevant factors such as mineral resources and corruption. We found that emerging-market MNCs were not deterred by relatively weak property owner rights (as indeed, was also the case for their counterparts from mature markets); hence, any weakening of countervailing worker rights is unlikely to unlock significant new FDI. However, emerging-market MNCs were more likely to invest in low-wage economies and did not appear to be concerned by local skills gaps; the latter would reflect the relative de facto ease with which even partially skilled expatriate labor can be imported into many African countries. At the same time, a reliance on low-wage, unskilled labor, coupled with the extensive usage of expatriates, brings with it a wide range of challenges for the HR manager, which a firm committed to cost-cutting may lack the capabilities to resolve. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Reconsidering Boundaries: Human Resource Management in a Networked World
Author-Name: Swart, Juani
Author-Name: Kinnie, Nicholas
Abstract: In the twenty-first century, work activities tend to span organizational boundaries and take place in projects or networks. This cross-boundary working has major implications for current HRM models that are more suited to an industrial economy, which assumes a single employer and where work is carried out within a set of clearly defined boundaries. We draw on a decade of empirical research in cross-boundary contexts to identify: (1) three types of networks (interactive, interwoven, and integrated) that vary according to their boundary properties, the focus of the work activity, and the prominent identification; (2) the particular structural, relational, and knowledge-based tensions (Phelps, Heidl, & Wadhwa, 2012) that are inherent in each networked context; and (3) three HRM models (buffering, borrowing, and balancing) that are appropriate to sustain networked working in these contexts. The main contribution of the article is the identification of HRM models in networked contexts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Global supply chains are part of the corporate strategy of many multinational companies, often with adverse effects on labor conditions. While employment relations scholars focus on a production-oriented paradigm, revolving around interactions among employers, workers, and government, much of the activism motivating the development of private labor standards is based around companies' relations with their consumers. This article proposes an analytical framework conceptualizing the interface of employment relations and consumption relations within global supply chains, identifying four regimes of labor governance: governance gaps, collective bargaining, standards markets, and complementary regimes. Finally, we suggest a research agenda for examining the role of consumption relations in the changing nature of global labor governance. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Following four decades of unprecedented economic, social, and cultural change, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) labor market is highly segmented: The native population is almost exclusively employed in the government sector, while the private sector is effectively outsourced to foreigners. This has created an unsustainable situation with growing numbers of young citizens reaching working age and with a public sector that has reached the saturation point. Policymakers repeatedly try to legislate to encourage private-sector employers to hire citizens. These policies have had limited success. We explored the career attitudes of 2,267 United Arab Emirates citizens prior to their entry into the labor market. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the social contract and resulting expectations toward state employment have strong implications for willingness to work in the private sector. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: HRM Systems for Knowledge Workers: Differences Among Top Managers, Middle Managers, and Professional Employees
Author-Name: Krausert, Achim
Abstract: This theoretical study contributes to the debate in the field of strategic HRM on whether HRM systems should differ across employee groups within the firm. It explores differences in the efficacy of two HRM systems—high-involvement HR and internal labor market systems—across top management teams, middle managers, and professional employees. In addition, it examines factors that may prevent the adoption of effective HRM systems for these groups of knowledge workers. A model is proposed depicting how four job-level moderators influence the HRM-performance relationship and how these moderators apply to each of the three employee groups. Short-term performance pressures and favoritism in staffing are proposed as factors that may hinder the adoption of effective HRM systems. Finally, HRM systems for different employee groups are classified based on their gains potential and barriers to implementation, yielding four categories of strategic HRM activity metaphorically labeled low-hanging fruits, high-hanging fruits, peanuts, and barren land. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Role Breadth: A Meta‐Analytic and Cross‐Cultural Analysis
Author-Name: Jiao, Changquan
Author-Name: Richards, David A.
Author-Name: Hackett, Rick D.
Abstract: We provide a meta-analysis of the empirical literature concerning role breadth, defined as the degree to which employees consider organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) to be an inherent part of their job. Results based on a combined sample size of 9,222 showed: (a) Confucian Asians consider OCB as part of their job to a greater extent than do their Anglo counterparts; (b) affiliative kinds of OCB (e.g., helping, conscientiousness, and courtesy) are more likely to be considered part of one's job than are change-oriented OCB (e.g., voice, taking charge, and initiative); and (c) OCB-inclusive role breadth correlates strongly with OCB (rc = .43). The implications of these findings for human resources practice, such as competency modeling, employee selection and training, organizational rewards, and employee-employer/supervisor relations, are discussed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Promoting Employee Flexibility Through HR Practices
Author-Name: Beltrán‐Martín, Inmaculada
Author-Name: Roca‐Puig, Vicente
Abstract: Current competitive environments have created a growing interest in employee flexibility in firms. Recently researchers have differentiated between two facets of employee flexibility: behavior flexibility and skill flexibility. This study proposes a model of relationships between these two facets of employee flexibility and the extent to which HR practices influence them. This model is tested by estimating structural equation models on a sample of 226 commercial departments in Spanish companies. The results of the study show that the two facets of employee flexibility are interrelated, in that skill flexibility influences behavior flexibility. Furthermore, findings confirm the influence of job enrichment on employee flexibility and the significant effect of the internal fit among HR practices on employee flexibility. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Repositioning Global Staff Transfers: A Learning Perspective
Author-Name: Welch, Denice
Author-Name: Steen, Adam
Abstract: In this article, we challenge the prevailing view that global staff transfers are a necessary cost of doing business globally by contending that such deployment is integral to successful strategic implementation. We use three scenarios—learning from failure, failure to learn, and lost opportunities—to illustrate how awareness of the consequences of decisions related to international staffing can facilitate their efficacy. Learning awareness therefore can lead to improved policies and outcomes for the management of global staff transfers and demonstrate the value HRM brings to the implementation process. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Assessing the Effects of Cultural Intelligence on Team Knowledge Sharing From a Socio‐Cognitive Perspective
Author-Name: Chen, Mei‐Liang
Author-Name: Lin, Chieh‐Peng
Abstract: Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this research postulates cultural intelligence as a key driver of knowledge sharing among culturally diverse teams. An empirical testing of the proposed model, by investigating team leaders from high-tech industries, reveals the applicability of social cognitive theory in understanding cultural intelligence, perceived team efficacy, and knowledge sharing. Specifically, the test results herein show that knowledge sharing is directly influenced by metacognitive, cognitive, and motivational cultural intelligence. At the same time, knowledge sharing is indirectly impacted by metacognitive and behavioral cultural intelligence through the mediation of perceived team efficacy. Lastly, this research provides managerial implications and limitations. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Ethnic and cultural diversity is an increasing reality in the US workplace. The current study highlights the importance of acknowledging the culturally heterogeneous nature of ethnic groups, and the need to focus on social identity characteristics such as cultural values when assessing group differences. We demonstrate that cultural values (i.e., individualism) contribute to employees' experiences of work-family conflict beyond the effects of ethnicity. Specifically, we introduce a model informed by social identity theory that explains why acculturation is related to work-family conflict. The model was tested with a sample of 309 employed Caucasian and Hispanic Americans. An empirical test of our model provides evidence that individualism mediates the relationship between language- and social-based acculturation and work-family conflict, even when controlling for ethnicity. Additionally, alternative models further reveal that the effects of acculturation and individualism contribute to work interfering with family. As an implication of the current study, we suggest that researchers and organizational managers should consider the cultural values of their diverse workforce when implementing policies that affect conflict between work and family. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Redmond, Elizabeth
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to generate empirical knowledge on how employees perceive and respond to competency models at work. A cross-sectional survey of 278 employees in four Norwegian organizations showed that competency models perceived as strategically and personally relevant and fairly rewarded were positively related to supervisor-rated work effort and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and self-rated “employability” outcomes. Exchange relationships mediated the link between competency model perceptions and work effort and OCB. Social exchange relationships marginally mediated the link between competency model perceptions and employees' openness to job-related changes and engagement in activities aimed at improving one's employability. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Sink or Swim: Empowering Leadership and Overload in Teams' Ability to Deal with the Unexpected
Author-Name: Magni, Massimo
Author-Name: Maruping, Likoebe M.
Abstract: The notion of improvisation has recently emerged in managerial studies as a viable solution to flexibly dealing with unexpected occurrences in work environments. However, past research on team improvisation has overlooked the contingencies that allow teams to effectively improvise. Drawing upon demand-control theory, we investigate how empowering leadership and overload affect the improvisation-performance relationship in the context of 48 work teams. Our results suggest that empowering leadership positively moderates the relationship between improvisation and performance, while overload attenuates the same relationship. Moreover, we found a joint effect of overload and empowering leadership influencing the improvisation-performance link, such that improvisation is most positively related to performance when empowering leadership is high and overload is low. Conversely, we found that empowering leadership is particularly detrimental to the improvisation-performance relationship when team members perceive high degrees of overload. Our findings make important contributions to the extant team literature as well as to the emerging literature on team improvisation. We outline several significant insights for HR managers and team leaders who are responsible for supporting teams that face unexpected events in the work environment. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Role of Human Resource Management in Strategy Making
Author-Name: Juul Andersen, Torben
Author-Name: Minbaeva, Dana
Abstract: Among the strategy scholars, there is general consensus that responsive-integrative strategy making is essential for ensuring a competitive advantage in contemporary dynamic environments. What is the role of HR in this process, and how can HR support responsive-integrative strategy making? To answer these questions, we use illustrative experiences from Chr. Hansen, a global supplier of bioscience-based ingredients to the food, health, and animal feed industries. We argue that HR's strategic role lies in providing support for both centralized and decentralized strategy making by offering aspirations for strategic decisions and by gathering various sources of inspiration for strategy discussions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employment in Chinese MNEs: Appraising the Dragon's Gift to Sub‐Saharan Africa
Author-Name: Jackson, Terence
Abstract: China's international engagement is changing geopolitical dynamics to an extent that Western governments appear concerned. Negative reports of this engagement in Africa abound, not least in the area of employment relations and human resource management. Yet currently there is a lack of serious management research and theory development in this area, leaving international HR managers to rely on anecdotal information. The way Chinese management engages with African workforces may be quite different from Western managers’. The current work suggests that understanding this engagement should be informed by China's recent anti-imperialist involvement in Africa, its commercial motivation coupled with its political-seeking motive, the values such as paternalism that modify Western influences on Chinese HRM that are brought to Africa, and possible synergies with African values. Yet the current work identifies from the current published evidence a disparity between China's professed strategic level of engagement and what happens at the organizational level, indicating that many Chinese organizations may be contributing to employment, but not to upskilling of workers, mutual learning, or engagement with local communities. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Gender Roles and Organizational HR Practices: The Case of Women's Careers in Accountancy and Consultancy Firms in China
Author-Name: Lee Cooke, Fang
Author-Name: Xiao, Yuchun
Abstract: The Chinese finance industry has experienced significant expansion both within the state sector and into the private sector. Professional consultancy firms have also emerged as a result of the rising interest in the outsourcing of accounting and management services. However, the study of women's careers in the accountancy profession in contemporary China remains largely an uncharted territory. Drawing on data from 69 interviews with auditors in five firms, this article investigates the nature of work of external auditors in China and how women auditors view their work-life choices and constraints. We explore the likely differences between male and female auditors in their career aspirations and the extent to which these self-perceived differences are informed by social conventions of gender role, organizational practices, and personal preferences. The study has strong implications for human resource management in professional service firms in China, with particular reference to job design, work organization, career support, and work-life balance initiatives. The study contributes to the debate on gender, employment, and career development in the accountancy profession in different parts of the world. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Twenty‐First Century Employment Relationships: The Case for an Altruistic Model
Author-Name: Clarkson, Gail P.
Abstract: Different parties in any form of employment relationship (ER) will display variation in terms of their motivations and what they want to accomplish. Insights into how we might meet these potentially competing interests come from the discipline of sociobiology. In particular, this article focuses upon multilevel selection (MLS); the central tenet being that internally altruistic groups are likely to outperform their more selfish counterparts, which many contemporary theoretical biologists agree is a legitimate theory accounting for evolutionary change and success. On the assumption that the interests of all parties are more likely to be realized in the context of overall organizational success, the simple logic of MLS challenges the quid pro quo arrangements central to dominant theoretical perspectives of the ER. Drawing upon the growing evidence in support of MLS theory, and long-accepted insights from social psychology, the case for altruism as a model of the ER fit for the twenty-first century world of work is presented and consideration is given as to how altruistic behaviors can be encouraged in all parties. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The full force of globalization has hit today's organizations, and it is clear that there are many cultural and human problems. International human resource management (IHRM) is being asked to better understand and develop multinational organizational leaders to meet the challenges. A prominent solution that is receiving increased attention is the construct of global mindset, which has growing rhetoric but little research support. To help fill this need, after first theoretically framing global mindset as made up of one's cultural intelligence and global business orientation, this study identifies and empirically tests some theory-driven antecedents. Utilizing a diverse sample (N = 136) of global leaders of a well-known multinational, we found that personal, psychological, and role complexity antecedents were related to the participants' level of global mindset. The practical implications of these findings for effective international human resource management conclude the article. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How High‐Commitment HRM Relates to Engagement and Commitment: The Moderating Role of Task Proficiency
Author-Name: Boon, Corine
Author-Name: Kalshoven, Karianne
Abstract: In a multisource field study, we examine the relationship between employee perceptions of high-commitment human resource management (HRM), task proficiency, work engagement, and organizational commitment. Based on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we first propose that work engagement mediates the relationship between high-commitment HRM and organizational commitment. Second, we propose a mediated moderation model in which employees’ task proficiency moderates the relationship between high-commitment HRM and work engagement, which in turn affects organizational commitment. Results indicate that the relationship between high-commitment HRM and organizational commitment was fully mediated by work engagement. Results also supported the mediated moderation model. A significant indirect effect was found from high-commitment HRM to commitment via engagement for low task proficiency, but not for high task proficiency. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Career Management Strategies of People With Disabilities
Author-Name: Kulkarni, Mukta
Author-Name: Gopakumar, K. V.
Abstract: People with disabilities (PWD) tend to experience less career success than their counterparts without a disability, and their talent and skill remain underutilized. Disability literature also outlines various barriers to careers of PWD. Yet there are those who successfully manage their careers. Our aim in the present interview-based study was to understand which strategies PWD engage in to manage their careers proactively. Findings indicate that strategies include maintaining a positive mind-set; trouncing competence stereotypes by sensitizing people to their ability through learning and applying new skills, and by seeking feedback; engaging in disability advocacy to remove performance myths; and building, leveraging, and contributing to disability networks. We noted gender and tenure differences with regard to strategies employed. Findings imply that career objectives of PWD are not those traditionally expected or lauded by organizations, and motivations for career self-management are unique to PWD as compared to those without a disability. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Rethinking Love at the Office: Antecedents and Consequences of Coworker Evaluations of Workplace Romances
Author-Name: Alder, G. Stoney
Author-Name: Quist, Douglas M.
Abstract: Researchers have pointed out a wide variety of organizational effects attributable to workplace romances, concluding that the impact of such romances on the workgroup can range from positive to negative. To date, however, little research has attempted to pinpoint the elements leading to this divergence. We suggest that coworker evaluation of a romance or anticipatory injustice may play a key role in influencing the positive or negative impact of the relationship on the workgroup at large. Our model proposes that three separate mechanisms (procedural fairness, intragroup cognitive dissonance, and normative adjustment), each corresponding to a different domain of evaluation, may mediate the apparent relationship between coworker evaluation of a romance and various aspects of group performance. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Enough is Enough: Cognitive Antecedents of Workaholism and Its Aftermath
Author-Name: van Wijhe, Corine I.
Author-Name: Peeters, Maria C. W.
Author-Name: Schaufeli, Wilmar B.
Abstract: Workaholism is commonly conceptualized as a compulsive inner drive to work excessively hard. This study investigates to what extent rigid personal beliefs—i.e.,  performance-based self-esteem  (self-esteem that is contingent upon good performance) and an  enough continuation rule  (continuing with work until one feels one has done enough)—contribute to exhaustion through workaholism. To examine these potential antecedents and consequences of workaholism, data of a two-wave longitudinal survey study with a six-month time interval was used (n = 191). Results of structural equation modeling provided support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our findings show that rigid personal beliefs at T1 predicted primarily working compulsively at T2, and working compulsively at T1 influenced exhaustion at T2. Moreover, reciprocal relationships were found between applying the enough continuation rule and working compulsively, and between working compulsively and exhaustion. These results suggest partial mediation from cognitive antecedents (personal beliefs) through workaholism to exhaustion. In practical terms, the results indicate that cognitive antecedents may provide a good starting point for interventions for preventing exhaustion and workaholism. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The aims of the research are to explore evidence of professional human resource management (HRM) role tensions, the factors that affect HRM role tension, and to consider the impact on management perceptions when role tensions exist. Using a qualitative approach, 25 interviews were conducted in Australia with senior HRM personnel, top management team (TMT) executives, and a management consultant. Findings reveal that the failure of the HRM profession to attract people with a business focus increases HRM role tensions. Respondents report that tensions were reduced when aspects of the HRM role were devolved or outsourced, there was an acceptance of a changed psychological contract, and clearer attempts were made to communicate an agreed-upon strategic focus for HRM. HRM role bias led to a reduced willingness among TMT members to respect, and communicate with, HRM professionals. The implications of the negative outcomes of HR role tensions are discussed with reference to the power of the HRM function. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Implementing Performance Appraisal: Exploring the Employee Experience
Author-Name: Farndale, Elaine
Author-Name: Kelliher, Clare
Abstract: Line managers play an important role as implementers of performance appraisal, enacting procedures designed by the HR function. However, the actual employee experience of these procedures (which may differ from how they were intended or enacted) in terms of perceptions of justice in the process is likely to have consequences for levels of organizational commitment. Furthermore, based on signaling theory, the broader organizational climate, measured here in terms of the level of trust employees have in the senior management, sets the context in which this experience takes shape. Presenting multilevel analysis of 4,422 employees across 22 business units, we show that organizational units with high trust in senior management have both higher levels of commitment, and show a stronger link between employee perceptions of fair treatment by their line manager during performance appraisal, and organizational commitment. This provides initial evidence that the impact of line manager actions is important for employee-level outcomes but is also constrained by the organizational climate. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In this study, we empirically examine the consequences of devolving HR responsibilities to first-line managers (FLMs) who make daily contacts with frontline workers. Drawing from HR strength theory, we propose that FLMs' involvement in HR enhances HR effectiveness. We also argue that the positive relationship between FLMs' HR involvement and HR effectiveness is compromised when a company employs an institutionally emerging HR system, and that this negative combinative effect will be alleviated by transferring HR knowledge to FLMs. We tested the hypothesized relationships using panel survey data from South Korea (N = 215). The results of our hierarchical regression analysis generally support our claims. Implications, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Effects of Outsourcing and Devolvement on the Strategic Position of HR Departments
Author-Name: Reichel, Astrid
Author-Name: Lazarova, Mila
Abstract: This article critically examines how outsourcing and devolvement of HR activities influence the strategic position of HR departments. Past research has offered conflicting predictions about their impact, ranging from a very positive move of HR departments to powerful strategic positions to a rather negative move toward marginality as their tasks are being taken over by either external providers or line managers. In an effort to resolve existing inconsistencies in the literature, we base our propositions on the strategic contingency theory of subunit power (Hickson, Hinings, Lee, Schneck, & Pennings, 1971). Our results suggest that the strategic position of HR departments is negatively influenced by devolvement to line management and positively influenced by outsourcing of noncore HR tasks. No significant effect of outsourcing core HR activities was found. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Bos‐Nehles, Anna C.
Author-Name: Van Riemsdijk, Maarten J.
Author-Name: Kees Looise, Jan
Abstract: Line managers are today seen as increasingly important in effectively implementing HRM practices. Based on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) theory, we predict that line managers' performance in this regard will depend on their ability to apply HRM practices, and that their motivation and the opportunity provided will enhance this effect. Through a survey of 174 line managers and 1,065 of their direct subordinates in two organizations, we found ability to be the best predictor of a line manager's HRM performance. Motivation did not moderate the effect of ability on performance as predicted, and our results suggest this relationship needs further attention. Opportunity did enhance the effect of ability on HRM implementation effectiveness. Therefore, HRM departments should aim to enhance line managers' abilities and provide adequate opportunities for them to carry out the expected HRM duties. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Balancing Interests in the Search for Occupational Legitimacy: The HR Professionalization Project in Canada
Author-Name: Pohler, Dionne
Author-Name: Willness, Chelsea
Abstract: Despite broad debates surrounding how the human resource management occupation can increase its legitimacy, researchers have yet to examine the collective steps HR practitioners are taking in this regard and the extent to which they have been successful. We conduct a case study of the HR professionalization project in Canada via multisource qualitative and quantitative data, which we analyze using a unique integration of the trait and control models from the sociology of professions, as well as isomorphism from institutional theory. Viewed through the lens of these frameworks, we find that HR practitioners are attempting to emulate traits that define traditional notions of professions, and are aspiring to transcendent values associated with balancing the sometimes conflicting interests of employers and employees. Objective data from external stakeholders and institutions show that these collective strategies have been somewhat successful in garnering greater legitimacy thus far, particularly when comparisons are made with the HR professional project in the United States. We highlight numerous implications for future research and practice surrounding the legitimacy of the HR profession. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How Does Relative Deprivation Influence Employee Intention to Leave a Merged Company? The Role of Organizational Identification
Author-Name: Cho, Bongsoon

Author-Name: Kim, Kwanghyun
Abstract: Recognizing the importance of postmerger integration from a human resource management perspective, this study explores the relationship between employee perceptions of relative deprivation during a merger and acquisition (M&A) process and their turnover intentions. Drawing on social identity theory, we investigate whether the relationship between relative deprivation and turnover intention can be mediated by employee organizational identification. The results, based on a two-phase survey of 222 employees in a merged Korean company, show that egoistic relative deprivation, defined as people's feelings of deprivation due to their dissatisfaction with their position as an individual, predicts employee turnover intention. Moreover, employee identification with the postmerger organization was found to fully mediate the relationship between egoistic relative deprivation and turnover intention.

Title: Organizational Work‐Family Culture and Working Mothers’ Affective Commitment: How Career Expectations Matter
Author-Name: Chang, Eunmi
Author-Name: Chin, Hyun
Author-Name: Ye, Jieun
Abstract: The research undertaken here examines how an organizational work-family culture affects the attitudes of working mothers. This research extends the existing findings by examining two separate mediation processes: work-family conflict and career expectations. The cases of 1,308 working mothers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that career expectations mediated the effect of an organizational work-family culture on affective commitment while work-family conflict did not. As an additional analysis, working mothers’ perceptions and attitudes were compared with those of 288 peers. Results disclose that working mothers were no less committed to their organization, and were even more committed than their peers early in their careers. Working mothers’ career expectations, however, were consistently lower than their peers’ expectations. Implications of these results are included. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Addressing the Stress of Work and Elder Caregiving of the Graying Workforce: The Moderating Effects of Financial Strain on the Relationship Between Work‐Caregiving Conflict and Psychological Well‐Being
Author-Name: Kim, Najung
Author-Name: Gordon, Judith R.
Abstract: Human resource policies and practices must consider the issues associated with an aging workforce, and, more specifically, the stress experienced by those involved in caring for elders. This study examined such stress by studying the relationship between work–elder caregiving conflict and well-being, as well as the role of perceived financial need in moderating that relationship. The sample included 583 women who worked full-time and had significant elder caregiving responsibilities. The analysis showed that work interfering with caregiving (WIC) was significantly associated with both positive and negative affect, but caregiving interfering with work (CIW) was not significantly associated with either. Perceived financial need decreased older women's psychological well-being and moderated the relationship between work–elder caregiving conflict and psychological well-being such that the negative effect of WIC was stronger for older women with higher perceived financial need, while CIW decreased the well-being of older women with lower perceived financial need but not for those with higher need. The results stress the importance of considering elder care as a source of work-family conflict when managing the aging workforce as well as suggest a way to attenuate the negative effect of work-family conflict by managing the perception of financial resources and needs of the employees. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Training and Performance of a Diverse Workforce

Author-Name: Mohr, Gisela
Abstract: The moderating role of work contracts on the relationship between human resource management (HRM) and the self-reported performance of 1,311 permanent and 924 temporary employees across three sectors was studied using a multilevel design in 103 organizations in three European countries. The HR practice examined was training and its allocation to the different workforce groups. The relationship between training for permanent employees and performance was moderated by work contract as well as country. In the Spanish sample, the performance of temporary employees was more negatively related to training for permanent employees as compared to the Dutch and the Swedish sample. Unexpectedly, in the Dutch sample, training provision was negatively related to the workforce group it was provided for. It is the temporary employees that seemed to be the cause of the interactions, underlining the call for special treatment of this workforce. Results indicate a considerable role of the interplay of job dependence and labor market conditions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Do I Really Want to Work Here? Testing a Model of Job Pursuit for MBA Interns
Author-Name: Beenen, Gerard
Author-Name: Pichler, Shaun
Abstract: Job pursuit refers to the intentions, decisions, or behaviors indicative of a candidate's interest in a particular employer. This study develops and tests a process model of job pursuit for MBA interns with data collected before, during, and after their internships. Our model integrates theory from the person-environment fit and organizational socialization literature. Results show pre-entry person-organization (P-O) fit and social aspects tactics jointly motivate proactive information seeking about the employer (from those inside and outside the assigned department) during the internship, and interactively motivate information seeking outside the assigned department. Yet, only information seeking inside the assigned department is related to learning about the employer. Learning about the employer also predicts job-acceptance intentions, which in turn predicts job-acceptance decisions. The model developed in this study should serve as a guide to help human resource managers understand job pursuit and acceptance in internships and other similar employment relationships. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The present study utilized sexual harassment, organizational climate, and engagement theories to articulate a process model of how perceived anti–sexual harassment practices and sexual harassment incidents relate to affective commitment and intentions to stay. The authors hypothesized that perceived anti–sexual harassment practices and sexual harassment incidents would relate to employee engagement, both directly and indirectly through psychological distress. Moreover, psychological distress and employee engagement were hypothesized to mediate the relationships of perceived anti–sexual harassment practices and sexual harassment incidents with affective commitment and intentions to stay. Study findings supported these hypotheses within two subsamples of female (N = 3,283 and 3,207) and male (N = 3,460 and 3,300) military personnel. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Recently there has been growing attention paid by practitioners to the need for effective measurement of the contribution of work-life management initiatives to both financial and nonfinancial performance objectives and to organizational effectiveness overall. We review a range of performance indicators, criteria, and indices that are used in a variety of countries to measure the performance of work-life initiatives. Using insights from research as a theoretical foundation, we present a framework for organizations to use when developing metrics for work-life measurement that comprise the four dimensions of planning and alignment, customization, supportive culture, and demonstrated value. Finally, we offer recommendations for research and practice related to measurement of work-life initiatives to assist scholars, managers, employees, and communities. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Mitchell, Rebecca

Author-Name: Bray, Mark
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a strategic role for human resource management (HRM) on organizational financial performance. Survey data from 118 financial and manufacturing organizations in Jordan is analyzed to investigate a moderated mediated pathway between a strategic role for HRM and organizational financial performance. The first finding, that high-performance human resource practices (HPHRPs) mediate the relationship between the HR strategic role and performance, suggests that the position of the HR professional as a strategic partner enhances the legitimacy of HR initiatives, as well as facilitating the resourcing and support for their implementation. The second finding, that line management devolvement moderates the relationship between the HR strategic role and HPHRPs, suggests a trade-off between a strategic and operational focus for HR professionals, and also indicates the value of embedding HR practice execution in operational administration. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article investigates the relationships between human resource management practices associated with New Ways to Work (employee empowerment, home-based teleworking, and creating trust relationships) and work-related flow as experienced by employees (absorption, work enjoyment, and intrinsic work motivation). Hypotheses, based on a combined perspective integrating insights from the HRM-process model and the job demands-resources model, are tested using multiactor multilevel data comprising employees (N = 1,017) and their line managers (N = 89), across 89 job categories in 30 organizations. Although organizations may implement management practices aimed at empowering employees in particular job categories, this study showed that anticipated effects on work-related flow (particularly work enjoyment) are not achieved when employees themselves do not experience being empowered, and when they do not use and experience their working conditions as job resources (home-based teleworking and trust relationships characterized by supporting leadership, collegial support, and collegial commitment). The article concludes with recommendations regarding organizational change aimed at implementing New Ways to Work and suggestions for future research. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The present study extends knowledge of the performance consequences of workgroup diversity climate. Building upon Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo's (1990) climate model of productivity, we introduce workgroup discrimination as a behavioral mediator that explains the positive effects of diversity climate on workgroup performance. In addition, we investigate group size as a moderator upon which this mediated relationship depends. We test these moderated-mediated propositions using a split-sample design and data from 248 military workgroups comprising 8,707 respondents. Findings from structural equation modeling reveal that diversity climate is consistently positively related to workgroup performance and that this relationship is mediated by discrimination. Results yield a pattern of moderated mediation, in that the indirect relationship between workgroup diversity climate (through perceptions of workgroup discrimination) and group performance was more pronounced in larger than in smaller workgroups. These results illustrate that discrimination and group size represent key factors in determining how a diversity climate is associated with group performance and, thus, have significant implications for research and practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Multisource Ratings Of Managerial Competencies And Their Predictive Value For Managerial And Organizational Effectiveness
Author-Name: Semeijn, Judith H.
Author-Name: Van Der Heijden, Beatrice I. J. M.
Author-Name: Van Der Lee, Anne
Abstract: This study examined the predictive value of multisource ratings of managerial competencies for managerial and organizational effectiveness. Data from 155 subordinates, 59 peers, and 28 supervisors were gathered in order to provide insight into their perceptions on managerial competencies for their managers. With regard to the outcome variable (i.e., effectiveness), both individual-level (subordinates’, peers’, and supervisors’ ratings of managers) and organizational-level (Balanced Scorecard) measures were used. As expected, subordinates, peers, and supervisors have distinct perspectives on the managerial competencies that are relevant for effectiveness. Moreover, the specific managerial competencies differ in terms of their predictive validity respectively for managerial and organizational effectiveness. The outcomes of our study suggest that a multisource and multimethod approach is valuable in assessing both managerial competencies and managerial and organizational effectiveness. Several implications for human resource management practices are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Human Resource Systems and Ethical Climates: A Resource‐Based Perspective
Author-Name: Manroop, Laxmikant

Author-Name: Ezzedeen, Souha
Abstract: We know very little about how ethical climates are built and the potential role of a firm's HR system in facilitating the development of this resource. The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm suggests that human resource systems directly influence a firm's performance through the development of resources that are deeply woven in a firm's history and culture. How this occurs though has not been thoroughly considered in the research literature. Drawing on the theoretical insights from the resource-based view of the firm, this article explores how HR systems can foster the development and maintenance of five types of ethical climates. In so doing, this article improves our conceptual understanding of why ethical climates may be seen as having strategic value for firms and how HR systems may influence that value. In addition, it contributes to theory by extending the domain of the resource-based view of the firm by exploring its integration with the varied types of ethical climates. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Identification and Occupational Stress: A Stress‐Buffering Perspective
Author-Name: Newton, Cameron
Author-Name: Teo, Stephen
Abstract: Occupational stress research has consistently demonstrated many negative effects of work stressors on employee adjustment (i.e., job-related attitudes and health). Considerable literature also describes potential moderators of this relationship. While research has revealed that different workplace identifications can have significant positive effects on employee adjustment, it has neglected to investigate their potential stress-buffering effects. Based on identity theories, it was predicted that stress-buffering effects of different types of identifications (distal versus proximal) would be revealed when the identification type and employee adjustment outcome type (distal versus proximal) were congruent. Predictions were tested with an employee sample from five human service nonprofit organizations (N = 337). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that main and moderated effects relating to identification supported the notion that occupational stress would be reduced when there was congruence of distal and proximal identifications and distal and proximal outcome types. However, stress-buffering effects were also found for high identifiers and low identifiers that were not in line with hypotheses posing questions for the definitions of distal and proximal identifications. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Jackson, Brent A.
Abstract: This article aims to expand understanding of managing younger workers by making work values central to their employment relationship. Attention is focused on values-based organizations where intrinsic values of societal contribution, work-life balance, and inclusive management practices may take on added significance for younger workers. Asking younger workers to explain what “success” or “efficiency” means to them in their work provides a window into the values-based reasoning underpinning younger workers' work-related attitudes and behavior. Person-organization values fit findings suggest areas where the younger worker employment relationship has possibly expanded (prosocial work, direct communication, managers as mentors, work-life balance). Implications for managing younger workers in values-based contexts are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of customizing (as opposed to standardizing) human resource management (HRM) practices on subsidiary performance in multinational corporations (MNCs). We examine how this relationship is influenced by environmental uncertainty. Hypotheses were tested using data from 92 subsidiaries of a large MNC operating in 27 countries. The results showed an interactive relationship between the customization of HRM practices and subsidiary environmental uncertainty on both financial (net profit) and nonfinancial (customer satisfaction) objective measures of subsidiary performance. The results of this study provide important empirical insights for researchers and practitioners into how HRM can be best configured to drive multiple performance outcomes for MNC subsidiaries. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Relationships Between MBO System Strength and Goal‐Climate Quality and Strength
Author-Name: Aksoy, Eda
Author-Name: Bayazit, Mahmut
Abstract: We adopted Bowen and Ostroff's (2004) HRM system strength concept so as to test it within the context of a management by objectives (MBO) system, which was utilized by six independent firms owned by a large, diversified family business group in Turkey. For this purpose, we surveyed the middle managers to measure 10 context-specific metafeatures of the MBO system. By using aggregated scores at the functional group level (N = 47), we captured the distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus dimensions of this HRM practice. We tested and compared three alternative theoretical models of HRM strength where the three dimensions have compensatory, additive, and distinctiveness mediated effects on climate quality and strength. Results support the compensatory model and indicate that the strength of the MBO system (as a reflective latent variable representing the shared variance of the system's distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus) is positively related to business units’ quality and strength of goal climate. In addition, distinctiveness—but not consistency and consensus—of the MBO system appears to be particularly critical for the emergence of a strong and high-quality goal climate. Lastly, implications and limitations of the study as well as possible future research directions are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Against the background of Bowen and Ostroff's (2004) human resource management (HRM) process theorization, this study explores influences on individual employee perceptions of the visibility, validity, and procedural and distributive justice of performance appraisal in subsidiaries of multinational corporations, and at what levels these influences reside. The study adopts an embedded, multiple-case design with interview data from 33 managers and professionals in six subsidiaries of three corporations. The findings show that perceptions of the performance appraisal process are driven by a number of influences pertaining to the unit, relationship, and individual levels. Further, the study highlights differences and similarities of influences across four performance appraisal process features, and identifies overlaps and inter-linkages between the process features suggested by Bowen and Ostroff (2004). For practitioners, the value of our study lies in the identification of steps that can be taken to increase the likelihood that HRM practices are perceived positively and as intended by the organization. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Ridder, Hans‐Gerd
Abstract: This study aims to shed light on the implementation of HR practices as a key piece of the human resource management (HRM)–performance puzzle. Although the literature suggests that discrepancies between the organization's intended and implemented HR practices are essential to understanding employees’ perceptions of and reactions to HRM, little attention has been devoted to this issue. Drawing upon a multiple-case study of German health and social services organizations, we therefore explore the linkages (and potential gaps) between intended, implemented, and perceived HR practices. Our study provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of this relationship, highlighting an organization's ability to leverage its resources as playing a crucial moderating role in implementing intended HR practices, while employees’ expectations of HRM moderate the link between implemented and perceived HR practices. We advance a set of propositions that contributes to a more nuanced, multilevel understanding of the complex phenomenon of HRM implementation. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a human resource management (HRM) system, which integrates both content and process of human resource (HR) practices, on organizational performance, through collective employee reactions. The analysis is based on a sample of 1,250 Greek employees working in 133 public- and private-sector organizations, which operate in the present context of severe financial and economic crises. The findings of the structural equation modeling suggest that content and process are two inseparable faces of an HRM system that help to reveal a comprehensive picture of the HRM–organizational performance relationship. Based on the findings that collective employee reactions mediate the HRM content (i.e., organizational performance relationship) and HRM process moderates the HRM content (i.e., employee reactions relationship), the study has several theoretical and practice implications. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Efforts to recruit and retain employees with disabilities are often tempered by employers’ concerns over potential workplace accommodation costs. This study reports on accommodations requested and granted in intensive case studies of eight companies, based on more than 5,000 employee and manager surveys, and interviews and focus groups with 128 managers and employees with disabilities. Two unique contributions are that we analyze accommodations for employees without disabilities as well as for those with disabilities, and compare perspectives on accommodation costs and benefits among employees, their coworkers, and their managers. We find people with disabilities are more likely than those without disabilities to request accommodations, but the types of accommodations requested and the reported costs and benefits are similar for disability and non-disability accommodations. In particular, fears of high accommodation costs and negative reactions of coworkers are not realized; all groups tend to report generally positive coworker reactions. Multilevel models indicate granting accommodations has positive spillover effects on attitudes of coworkers, as well as a positive effect on attitudes of requesting employees, but only when coworkers are supportive. Consistent with recent theorizing and other studies, our results suggest the benefits from a corporate culture of flexibility and attention to the individualized needs of employees. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Chambel, Maria José
Abstract: This study investigates whether contract type (temporary versus permanent employment) moderates the relationship between emotional exhaustion and supervisor-rated individual performance. Most temporary workers desire permanent employment, and this may drive them to uphold performance also when strained. This hypothesis was tested with multiple-group analysis in a sample of 430 call-center operators from five Portuguese organizations from different sectors. The results show that emotional exhaustion related negatively to supervisor-rated individual performance among permanent workers, but not among temporary workers. Our conclusion is that the relationship between emotional exhaustion and supervisor-rated individual performance is conditional upon contract type. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Gender‐Specific Preferences in Global Performance Management: An Empirical Study of Male and Female Managers in a Multinational Context
Author-Name: Festing, Marion
Author-Name: Knappert, Lena
Author-Name: Kornau, Angela
Abstract: This study investigates gender-specific preferences in one important human resource management (HRM) practice—namely, global performance management (GPM). GPM has major consequences for the career advancement of women and can therefore also represent a barrier if it is rooted in traditional male corporate cultures. As prior research suggests that the underrepresentation of women in top management positions is a worldwide phenomenon with only minor national variations, empirical data were collected in five countries belonging to various cultural clusters: China, France, Germany, South Africa, and the United States. For all countries, the results show that preferences vary significantly between male and female managers for crucial parts of the GPM system (actors’ roles, evaluation methods, feedback procedures, and GPM purposes). This study confirms that the preferences of female managers do not match more male-oriented GPM practices, indicating that female managers are less satisfied with existing GPM procedures. It was particularly surprising to find that these gender differences do not vary according to cultural background, but rather display the same pattern in all investigated countries. These findings not only have the potential to explain the often-limited career advancement of women, but also have major implications for multinational companies aiming to retain talented women. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Emerging Giants, Aspiring Multinationals, and Foreign Executives: Leapfrogging, Capability Building, and Competing with Developed Country Multinationals
Author-Name: Arp, Frithjof
Abstract: The phenomenon of emerging-market organizations appointing foreign executives from distant cultural contexts to headquarters positions has stirred public and academic interest. Emerging giants, aspiring multinationals, and even local organizations that focus entirely on domestic markets have joined the global hunt for management talent. This article reports why foreign executives from significant cultural distance are appointed to local headquarters positions, what they contribute, and why these positions are not filled with local executives. Data are sourced from in-depth interviews with two sample groups in organizations founded and headquartered in Malaysia (46 foreign executives from 13 countries and 25 host-country peers from three local ethnocultural groups). Triangulation of dyadic data from these two sample groups reveals a dichotomy between the initial reasons for which foreign executives are appointed and the continued reasons why some of these executives remain in their positions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Exercise as a Means of Reducing Perceptions of Work‐Family Conflict: A Test of the Roles of Self‐Efficacy and Psychological Strain
Author-Name: Clayton, Russell W.
Author-Name: Thomas, Christopher H.
Author-Name: Singh, Barjinder
Author-Name: Winkel, Doan E.
Abstract: Prior research suggests that exercise has positive benefits for individuals and the organizations they work for. Using the literature related to social cognitive theory and exercise, the present study hypothesizes and tests the effects of exercise on two directions of work-family conflict: work interference with family (WIF) and family interference with work (FIW). Using a sample of 476 working adults, we found that exercise was both positively related to self-efficacy for managing work-family conflict and negatively related to reported psychological strain, which in turn were related to reductions in work-family conflict. Model fit for the data support our contention that exercise indirectly influences work-family conflict via its direct impact on increased self-efficacy and reduced psychological strain. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Chinese Multinational Firms in Asia and Africa: Relationships With Institutional Actors and Patterns of HRM Practices
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Abstract: Interest in the internationalization of Chinese firms has soared in recent years. However, studies that compare Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs) in different industries and their human resource management (HRM) remain limited. This study fills this research gap by examining the HRM practices of Chinese MNCs and the extent to which these are shaped by the institutional factors that are specific to industries. It focuses on the Chinese operations in the South/Southeast Asian and African regions because Chinese firms tend to have various competitive advantages in these regions. The article draws on a number of theoretical perspectives, particularly the political economy and institutional perspectives, to make sense of the different contexts under which Chinese MNCs invest and operate. It argues that in examining Chinese MNCs, it is important to contemplate the role of the government and a wider range of institutional actors in order to understand how the dynamic interactions of these actors may shape the HRM of these firms with broader economic and social impacts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Chinese MNCs’ Preparation for Host‐Country Labor Relations: An Exploration of Country‐of‐Origin Effect
Author-Name: Zhu, Judith Shuqin
Author-Name: Zhu, Cherrie Jiuhua
Author-Name: De Cieri, Helen
Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated the existence of the country-of-origin effect and how this effect interacts with other factors in shaping multinational corporations’ (MNCs’) practices. However, there has been little investigation of different forms of country-of-origin effect, the mechanisms through which this effect occurs, or country-of-origin effect on MNCs from emerging markets. This study explores how country-of-origin effect manifests in Chinese MNCs’ preparation for managing host country labor relations, an important area of human resource management (HRM). Based on a study of 21 Chinese MNCs, we argue that country-of-origin effect in relation to Chinese MNCs mainly manifests in two implicit forms, including transfer of management ethos and competitive disadvantage generated from the home base, rather than in the form of direct practice transfer as commonly suggested in the current literature. The major mechanism through which country-of-origin effect plays out is the mind-set of managers, rather than formally established corporate control instruments. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article examines the role of quality of working life (QWL) in the relationships between high-performance work systems (HPWSs) and employee in-role performance and extra-role behavior. Using the data from 1,051 teachers and their immediate supervisors in 63 Chinese schools, we performed multilevel analysis to test meso-mediation models. The results showed that HPWSs directly and indirectly influence teachers’ in-role performance and extra-role behavior through the mediation of QWL. These findings demonstrate that QWL is an important conduit of the relationships between HPWSs and employee work behaviors. The article concludes by discussing the implications for management and future research. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This article analyzes variations in the international human resource management (IHRM) approaches of Russian multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the contexts of developed and developing countries. The data were gathered through interviews conducted at the headquarters of Russian MNEs and at their subsidiaries in developed and developing countries. The results indicate that Russian MNEs adopt HRM practices of Western origin. However, these MNEs differ radically in their choices of IHRM approaches. Many of these differences depend on the countries these MNEs target in their international expansion. In developing countries that belong to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, regional block of countries that were former Soviet republics), the IHRM approaches adopted by Russian MNEs typically reflect a feeling of superiority. However, in developed countries and in non-CIS developing countries, Russian MNEs actively promote a mix of global best practices and local HRM practices. We do not find any instances of the reverse transfer of management practices from subsidiaries in developed countries to the MNEs’ headquarters or any examples of cross-pollination among subsidiaries. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Crossley, Craig
Abstract: Today there is a large divide between the vast majority of management research that is conducted and the opportunities for doing work that is useful for both research and practice. Action research offers a great opportunity to bridge the divide, with benefits for all involved. For academic researchers, action research can increase access to important research sites that otherwise would remain off-limits, while simultaneously increasing the relevance and scope of the research issues addressed. For researchers and practitioners who work in organizations, and for external consultants, action research offers a way to scientifically evaluate important organizational issues using scientific methods. These methods provide a type of external validity and support for actions that otherwise could be dismissed as representing a biased internal agenda. Moreover, internal researchers who engage in action research enable the sharing of insights that can benefit practitioners in other organizations as well as the research community. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Experience Matters? The Impact of Prior CEO Experience on Firm Performance

Author-Name: Koyuncu, Burak
Abstract: We sample CEOs of the 2005 S&P 500 corporations to look at the relationship between experience in the CEO position of a different firm and the post-succession financial performance of the firm that they currently lead. We find that experience in the CEO position is negatively related to firm performance. CEOs who directly move to their current CEO position from the previous one and those with job-specific experience in the same or related industry or at the helm of a previous company similar in size to the current one are associated with significantly lower post-succession performance than those without prior CEO experience. The results contribute to the literatures on CEO succession, the performance effect of job-specific experience, and the transferability of human capital. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Looking Forward to Performance Improvement: A Field Test of the Feedforward Interview for Performance Management

Author-Name: Manroop, Laxmikant
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of the feedforward interview for improving the job performance of employees relative to a traditional performance appraisal interview in a business equipment firm. Managers (n = 25) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Employees (n = 70) who engaged in a feedforward interview with their manager were observed by an anonymous peer to perform significantly better on the job four months later than employees (n = 75) who received the company's traditional performance appraisal interview. The finding that the feedforward intervention increased performance relative to the performance appraisal indicates that the effect is a relatively enduring one. The results suggest that the feedforward interview should prove useful for human resource managers who are searching for ways to increase the performance of their organization's human resources over and above the traditional performance appraisal. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examine the impact of the cross-border acquisitions made by firms from emerging markets on employee productivity and employment growth. The literature suggests that cross-border acquisitions enable emerging market firms to obtain new skills and knowledge-intensive assets, which, in turn, may increase productivity. However, our empirical analysis suggests that cross-border acquisitions reduce employee productivity and have a limited impact on employment growth. Moreover, we find that cross-border acquisitions in less-developed countries and in culturally distinct countries reduce productivity. Overall, our findings cast doubt on the idea that cross-border acquisitions enable emerging market firms to improve the productivity of one of their most important resources—namely, their human capital. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The organizational inducement model proposed in this study seeks to examine the mediating role of perceived insider status (PIS) and the moderating role of vertical collectivism on the relationship between organizational inducements and employees’ organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Among a sample of Chinese employees, the authors find that the organizational inducements of perceived supervisor support and participation led to higher levels of PIS, which in turn enhanced OCB. Furthermore, vertical collectivism moderated the relationship between PIS and OCB, such that their relationship grew stronger when collectivism was high. These findings have notable implications for theory and practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Global HR Roles and Factors Influencing Their Development: Evidence From Emerging Indian IT Services Multinationals
Author-Name: Thite, Mohan

Author-Name: Wilkinson, Adrian
Abstract: The rapid growth of emerging markets’ multinational companies (MNCs) is a recent phenomenon and, as such, their nature and structure of key management processes, functions, and roles need further examination. While an abundance of low-cost labor is often the starting point of competitive advantage for many of the emerging markets’ MNCs, it is the optimum configuration of people, processes, and technology that defines how they leverage their intangible resources. Based on case studies of four Indian IT services MNCs, involving 51 in-depth interviews of business and human resource (HR) leaders at the corporate and subsidiary levels, we identify five key HR roles—namely, strategic business partner, guardian of culture, builder of global workforce and capabilities, champion of processes, and facilitator of employee development. The analysis also highlights that the HR function in Indian IT service MNCs faces several challenges in consolidating the early gains of internationalization, such as lack of decentralized decision making, developing a global mind-set, localization of the workforce, and developing a global leadership pipeline. Based on our exploratory findings, we propose a framework outlining the global HR roles pursued by emerging IT services MNCs, the factors influencing them, and the challenges facing their HR function for future research. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Predictors of the Adoption of LGBT‐Friendly HR Policies
Author-Name: Everly, Benjamin A.
Author-Name: Schwarz, Joshua L.
Abstract: Employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a persistent problem not addressed by federal and most state equal employment opportunity laws in the United States. Despite this lack of regulation, a growing number of organizations are voluntarily adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their nondiscrimination statements, providing domestic partner benefits, sponsoring affinity groups, and establishing other “LGBT-friendly” policies. This article incorporates institutional theory and organizational demography to explore the antecedents to these policies to understand why some organizations seek to be at the forefront of this trend while others do only the minimum to embrace this element of diversity. The analysis of a sample of Fortune 1000 firms reveals that state law dealing with gay rights in non-employment-related areas for the state where each company is headquartered, the number of women serving on each firm's board of directors, and whether other companies in the same industry have adopted progressive policies are all related to company policy toward its LGBT employees. Sexual orientation of employees by industry does not seem to influence company policy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: My Strengths Count!

Author-Name: Meyers, Maria Christina
Abstract: This article builds on the argument that research on the link between HRM and performance benefits from investigating how HR practices are envisioned by managers (in terms of underlying philosophies), and how they are perceived by employees (in terms of psychological climates). Our study focuses on the effects of a strengths-based HR philosophy assuming that employee performance can be maximized through leveraging individual strengths. This philosophy relates to a strengths-based psychological climate, that is, employee perceptions of the opportunities they get to identify, develop, and use their strengths. We hypothesized that a strengths-based psychological climate positively influences employees’ positive affect, which in turn enhances their in-role and extra-role performance. In our study, 442 respondents working in 39 departments of eight Dutch and Belgian organizations gave ratings on the strength-based psychological climate of their organization, and indicated their level of work-related positive affect, in-role performance, and extra-role performance. Results of multilevel hierarchical regression analyses supported our hypotheses by indicating that strengths-based psychological climate was positively linked to in-role and extra-role performance, and that this link was mediated by positive affect. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We examine the relationship between agent (CEO) risk bearing and the quality of executive risk-taking outcomes, by examining the contingency effect of CEO perceived firm efficacy. In doing so, we extend the behavioral agency model (BAM) beyond predictions of risk magnitude to examining how CEO risk-taking outcomes differ qualitatively in response to risk bearing. We argue that CEO risk bearing (due to stock options or cash compensation) will positively influence performance outcomes in the presence of higher perceived firm efficacy. However, this positive influence reverses when efficacy is lower. We demonstrate the utility of firm efficacy in exploring the effect of agent risk bearing on performance outcomes and provide the insight that the CEO pay-performance relationship is influenced by the CEO’s perception of firm efficacy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Selecting the Good vs. Rejecting the Bad: Regulatory Focus Effects on Staffing Decision Making
Author-Name: Kuhn, Kristine M.
Abstract: Although staffing decisions are typically conceptualized as motivated by the desire to select the best employees, many managers and human resources practitioners may be more concerned with avoiding bad hires. Regulatory focus theory provides a rich and well-developed framework for understanding how prevention and promotion orientations shape judgments and decisions. This work is the first to examine this theory's implications for understanding staffing, and it illustrates how these fundamental underlying motivations alter the salience of costs and benefits associated with staffing practices, as well as subjective judgments about individual applicants. Regulatory focus is a function of situational factors as well as individual differences, and predominant motivational orientations also vary with business cycles. This model therefore offers broad cross-level explanatory power for understanding dynamic factors influencing staffing, as well as a novel perspective on ways to improve the quality of staffing decision making. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Through two separate studies involving 47 interviews inside 22 institutions in the capital markets and investment banking sector, we explore the levels of influence and sources of credibility for senior HR professionals, and examine the challenges they face in establishing credibility. We compare these findings against previous research, which has identified several determinants of HR’s influence and credibility. Our findings confirm that HR’s modest influence is contingent on the predispositions and convictions of key stakeholders, notably the CEO, but also depends on the decision being taken. We find that the basis for senior HR professionals’ credibility is more individual than institutional, and that HR professionals and senior business managers differ in the priorities they assign to credibility determinants. Finally, the studies illuminate an enduring inherent tension for HR in establishing credibility, between servicing their internal clients’ needs and retaining a level of independence. We reflect upon the transient nature of HR credibility in this sector and others. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Teams are pervasive in today's world, and rightfully so as we need them. Drawing upon the existing extensive body of research surrounding the topic of teamwork, we delineate nine “critical considerations” that serve as a practical heuristic by which HR leaders can determine what is needed when they face situations involving teamwork. Our heuristic is not intended to be the definitive set of all considerations for teamwork, but instead consolidates key findings from a vast literature to provide an integrated understanding of the underpinnings of teamwork—specifically, what should be considered when selecting, developing, and maintaining teams. This heuristic is designed to help those in practice diagnose team-based problems by providing a clear focus on relevant aspects of teamwork. To this end, we first define teamwork and its related elements. Second, we offer a high-level conceptualization of and justification for the nine selected considerations underlying the heuristic, which is followed by a more in-depth synthesis of related literature as well as empirically-driven practical guidance. Third, we conclude with a discussion regarding how this heuristic may best be used from a practical standpoint, as well as offer areas for future research regarding both teamwork and its critical considerations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Work‐To‐Life Conflict and Enrichment Among International Business Travelers: The Role of International Career Orientation

Author-Name: Suutari, Vesa
Abstract: The present study examines the direct and moderating effects of an international career orientation in the relationship between frequency and duration of international business traveling and work-to-life conflict and enrichment. In addition, the effort-reward imbalance that potentially features in the international business traveler's job was examined in relation to work-to-life conflict and enrichment. The study was conducted among 232 Finnish people in jobs requiring international business travel. A moderated hierarchical regression analysis shows that travel of considerable duration and a pronounced effort-reward imbalance had direct links to work-to-life conflict. In contrast, low effort-reward imbalance and a strong international career orientation had direct links to work-to-life enrichment. In addition, having a strong orientation to an international career decreases work-to-life conflict when a job requires very frequent traveling, but the moderation effect was not found in relation to duration of traveling. Our findings indicate that interventions aimed at reducing work-to-life conflict and increasing work-to-life enrichment among international business travelers should focus on fostering a balance between efforts and rewards at work. The extent of employees’ internationalism should also be considered when recruiting people into jobs involving international business travel. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Discriminatory Climate Perceptions on the Composition of Intraorganizational Developmental Networks, Psychosocial Support, and Job and Career Attitudes of Employees with an Invisible Stigma
Author-Name: Trau, Raymond N. C.
Abstract: Recent diversity research recognizes that employees’ social identity and perceptions of diversity openness and support shape their career experience and decisions. To build further on this line of work, this study aims to advance an understanding of the impact of discriminatory climate perceptions on the social relationships at work and work-related attitudes of employees with an invisible stigma. To achieve this purpose and test hypotheses, professional lesbians and gay men were selected as a representative group of the invisible stigmatized population. This study found that perceptions of nondiscriminatory climate toward an individual's invisible stigmatized group is positively related to her/his formation of a similar developmental network, and those who perceived nondiscriminatory climate in their organization are more likely to disclose stigmatized identity and receive higher psychosocial support from their developmental network. Further, psychosocial support was found to be positively related to job and career satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications on workplace stigmatization, developmental network, and workplace diversity are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Work–Family Programs on the Relationship between Gender Diversity and Performance
Author-Name: Ali, Muhammad

Abstract: Work–family programs signal an employer's perspective on gender diversity to employees, and can influence whether the effects of diversity on performance are positive or negative. This article tests the interactive effects of nonmanagement gender diversity and work–family programs on productivity, and management gender diversity and work–family programs on financial performance. The predictions were tested in 198 Australian publicly listed organizations using primary (survey) and secondary (publicly available) data based on a two-year time lag between diversity and performance. The findings indicate that nonmanagement gender diversity leads to higher productivity in organizations with many work–family programs, and management gender diversity leads to lower financial performance in organizations with few work–family programs. The results suggest different business cases at nonmanagement and management levels for the adoption of work–family programs in gender-diverse organizations. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Institutional Antecedents of the Assignment of HRM Responsibilities to Line Managers

Author-Name: Gollan, Paul J.
Abstract: This article uses large-scale international data to examine how much autonomy organizations have to assign human resource management responsibilities to line managers, as indicated in the prescriptions of the literature. We use data from 11 countries to explore the impact of a variety of internal characteristics of organizations and the kind of economy in which they operate. We find that around half of the organizations assign HRM responsibilities to the line and that organizations appear to have considerable latitude in making choices in this area. Organizations in the Nordic economies are most likely to assign responsibilities for HRM to the line and those in the liberal market economies are the least likely to do so. In any economy, larger organizations, unionized organizations, and those with strategically positioned HRM departments are the least likely to allocate responsibilities for HRM to the line. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and for practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS program, a career development intervention based on career competencies and the JOBS methodology, which aims to stimulate career self-management and well-being of young employees. In a quasi-randomized control trial, the effects of the program were tested in a homogeneous sample of young employees with intermediate vocational education (Nintervention = 112, Nnon-intervention = 61) and in a heterogeneous sample of employees from a special reintegration program (Nintervention = 71, Nnon-intervention = 41). Our results support the effectiveness of the intervention: participants of the CareerSKILLS program, versus a control group, showed increases in six career competencies (reflection of motivation, reflection on qualities, networking, self-profiling, work exploration, and career control), self-efficacy, resilience against setbacks, career-related behaviors, perceived employability, and work engagement. These results provide empirical support for the effectiveness of the CareerSKILLS program. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Responses to Discrimination: Relationships Between Social Support Seeking, Core Self‐Evaluations, and Withdrawal Behaviors

Abstract: Drawing from the theory of conservation of resources (Hobfoll, 1989), we examined relationships between social support seeking as a response to perceived discrimination from supervisors, core self-evaluations, and withdrawal behaviors. We further studied how the relationship between social support seeking and withdrawal behaviors was moderated by core self-evaluations. With two different samples, we found, as expected, that social support seeking in response to discrimination from supervisors is positively related to employee withdrawal behaviors, and core self-evaluations is negatively related to withdrawal behaviors. Across the two samples, we also found evidence that the relationship between social support seeking and withdrawal behaviors was weaker when core self-evaluations were high compared to low. We discuss implications of our results in the context of past research. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: It Takes Three to Tango: Exploring the Interplay among Training Intensity, Job Autonomy, and Supervisor Support in Predicting Knowledge Sharing
Author-Name: Buch, Robert
Author-Name: Dysvik, Anders
Author-Name: Kuvaas, Bård
Author-Name: Nerstad, Christina G. L.
Abstract: This study explored whether the relationship between perceived training intensity and knowledge sharing is prone to combined moderating influences. We operationalized perceived training intensity as a challenge stressor, in accordance with the challenge-hindrance framework of work stressors. The results of a study of 129 employees from three Norwegian service industries revealed a positive relationship between perceived training intensity and supervisor-rated knowledge sharing for employees reporting high levels of perceived job autonomy and high levels of perceived supervisor support. In contrast, we found a negative relationship between perceived training intensity and supervisor-rated knowledge sharing for employees reporting high levels of perceived job autonomy and low levels of perceived supervisor support. These findings suggest that supervisors are of vital importance in facilitating knowledge sharing among employees in settings where developmental challenges are prevalent and perceptions of job autonomy are high. Implications for future research and practice are also discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Development and Validation of an Employee Voice Strategy Scale through Four Studies in Japan
Author-Name: Matsunaga, Masaki
Abstract: Employee voice is an important organizational behavior that affects work group performance, and many studies have explored its mechanism; nonetheless, the existing literature narrowly defines the construct and overlooks a variety of strategic approaches employees take as they engage in voice. Based on this problematization, the current research has developed and validated a scale of employee voice strategy through four studies in Japan (total N = 1,156). Employee voice strategy is defined as a set of direct and indirect communicative approaches that organizational members utilize to share ideas with intentions to exert constructive influence to their work group. Studies 1 and 2 analyzed interview narratives to develop an initial typology, which was refined in Study 3 into a six-factor scale. Study 4 replicated it through confirmatory factor analyses. Construct validity of the scale was also examined by testing the strategy factors’ nomological network—as expected, proactive personality was positively associated with assertive strategies, while relationship maintenance goal orientation was linked to conciliatory, nonconfrontational strategies; negative emotion display showed negative associations with voice strategy use in general. These findings were discussed vis-à-vis culturally inclusive human resource management practices, as well as theoretical exploration of the employee voice phenomena from process-centered perspectives. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Language‐Based Exclusion and Prosocial Behaviors in Organizations
Author-Name: Kulkarni, Mukta
Author-Name: Sommer, Kristin
Abstract: Organizations can be seen as amalgams of languages that can serve as a source of divisive tensions among employees. In our conceptual model, we draw upon social identity and social exclusion research to propose that linguistic diversity increases the potential for language-based exclusion in multilingual work settings. Language may cue listeners to ethnic or cultural stereotypes as well as negatively affect perceptions of speakers’ competence, leading listeners to exclude speakers of certain languages. We contend that when excluded, perception of oneself can be cast in an antagonistic relation to perceptions of others, with detrimental effects on prosocial behaviors. Perceptions of procedural unfairness, a weakened identity, and impaired mood serve to amplify the association between language-based exclusion and prosocial behaviors. However, organizational factors such as positive diversity climate may mitigate experiences with language-based exclusion. We outline an agenda for future research and discuss implications for human resource practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Revisiting the Curvilinear Relation Between Job Insecurity and Work Withdrawal: The Moderating Role of Achievement Orientation and Risk Aversion
Author-Name: Yi, Xiang
Author-Name: Wang, Shuhong
Abstract: Although speculation of the curvilinear relations between job insecurity and job-related behaviors is theoretically appealing, the empirical evidence has been sparse. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature on job insecurity and work withdrawal behaviors by reexamining their curvilinear relation, and the effects of achievement orientation and propensity for risk aversion on this U-shaped relationship. Using samples with both secure and insecure job situations, we hypothesized that job insecurity could have both positive and negative effects on work withdrawal simultaneously; however, one of these effects could dominate the other at different levels of job insecurity. That is, a U shape would best describe such a relationship, since a moderate level of job insecurity would result in the lowest level of work withdrawal. Furthermore, we hypothesized that achievement orientation and propensity for risk aversion moderates this relationship in such a way that the curvilinear relationship is weaker (flattened curve) when the individual's achievement orientation is high, and that the curvilinear relationship is stronger (steep curve) when the individual's propensity for risk aversion is high. Results show that these hypotheses were supported; implications and limitations of the study are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Comparing the Explanatory Capacity of Three Constructs in the Prediction of Engineers’ Proficiency, Adaptivity, and Proactivity
Author-Name: García‐Chas, Romina

Author-Name: Varela‐Neira, Concepción
Abstract: Advances in the research of work performance have been due in large part to the conceptualization of performance as a multidimensional construct. Recently, Griffin, Neal, and Parker (2007), have identified three different dimensions of work role performance: proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity. Social effectiveness constructs (i.e., political skill) have been receiving increased attention in research and there have been recent calls for further research in the area. This study compares the explanatory capacity of political skill, professional experience and intrinsic motivation in the prediction of engineers' proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity. The relationships were tested with structural equations analysis of 180 supervisor-engineer dyad data. Results indicate that the three dimensions of individual work performance are significantly influenced by political skill and professional experience, but not by intrinsic motivation. The results also indicate that political skill is the strongest predictor. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Recruitment Process Outsourcing and Applicant Reactions: When Does Image Make a Difference?
Author-Name: Claus Wehner, Marius
Author-Name: Giardini, Angelo
Author-Name: Kabst, Rüdiger
Abstract: Many organizations transfer parts of their recruitment process to external service providers—often referred to as recruitment process outsourcing (RPO)—to save costs and enhance the quality of their recruitment procedures. However, contrary to the expectations regarding RPO, Wehner, Giardini, and Kabst (2012) found that RPO might cause negative reactions to recruitment procedures among graduates. We extend that study by incorporating a brand equity perspective in examining whether employer image and service provider image counterbalance negative reactions among graduates. Utilizing a scenario-based, between-subject design, we obtain results that show that the extent of RPO negatively influences applicant reactions regardless of the employer's or service provider's image. Furthermore, we find negative mediating effects of RPO on job acceptance intention. However, the perceived fit between employer image and service provider image positively influences applicant reactions. Moreover, employer image positively influences employer attractiveness and service provider image positively influences applicants’ satisfaction with the recruitment process. Thus, a strong employer image and service provider image partially compensate for the negative effects of RPO on applicant reactions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Understanding the Determinants of Who Gets Laid Off: Does Affective Organizational Commitment Matter?
Author-Name: Zatzick, Christopher D.

Author-Name: Iverson, Roderick D.
Abstract: Whereas prior research has focused on structural, demographic, and human capital factors to predict who gets laid off, the current study examines affective organizational commitment as an additional attribute related to an employee's layoff chances. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between affective organizational commitment and an individual's layoff chances, as well as whether this relationship differs between high and low performers. Event history analysis is conducted using survey data with matched personnel records from 3,057 employees across 563 Australian bank branches. After controlling for numerous predictors of layoffs, the results demonstrate that affective organizational commitment decreases the likelihood of an employee being laid off. Further, the effects of affective organizational commitment on an individual's layoff chances are greater for lower performers than higher performers. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers and practitioners. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Can We Still be Friends? The Role of Exit Conversations in Facilitating Post‐Exit Relationships
Author-Name: Kulik, Carol T.

Author-Name: Perera, Sanjeewa
Abstract: Organizations might benefit from maintaining relationships with former employees, who could be rehired later or encouraged to refer job applicants and customers. We integrate the management literature on voluntary resignations and the communication literature on relationship dissolution to explore how conversations between an exiting employee and his or her manager facilitate (or constrain) post-exit relationships. Employees who had recently resigned from full-time jobs described their exit experiences in semistructured interviews with the research team. The results suggest two dominant patterns. When employees exited for external reasons (e.g., to pursue a program of study), they engaged in very direct communication strategies, elicited positive responses from their managers, and left with high interest in a post-exit relationship. But when employees exited for internal reasons (problems within the employment relationship), they engaged in multiple exit cycles and moved from indirect communication strategies toward increasingly direct ones. Managerial responses to these strategies failed to capitalize on opportunities to nurture post-exit relationships and sometimes generated a “vendetta effect” among exiting employees. The results suggest that managers might benefit from training in how to conduct effective exit conversations, particularly with employees who are leaving for internal reasons. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Women Managers’ Careers in China: Theorizing the Influence of Gender and Collectivism
Author-Name: Woodhams, Carol
Author-Name: Xian, Huiping
Author-Name: Lupton, Ben
Abstract: This article is concerned with developing an understanding of the careers of women managers in China. Existing literature suggests that while women in China are comparatively well represented in management roles, they face distinctive pressures and barriers to their progress arising from entrenched patriarchal and collectivist aspects of the Chinese cultural tradition. However, little is known about how these aspects impact on women's orientations towards their careers and to what extent influential Western career theories are adequate in interpreting their experience. Drawing on interviews with 20 women managers in China, the article interprets women's orientations towards their careers in relation to their adherence to traditional gender roles and collectivist values. Using this framework, a fourfold taxonomy is developed which identifies “conformist,” “revolutionary,” “soloist,” and “dissident” orientations. The article suggests that Western career theories fail to capture the collective dimension, and thus do not account fully for the range of experience and orientations of Chinese women managers that are captured in the taxonomy. Implications, both practical and theoretical, are discussed. Recommendations are also made as to how management and career development policies might be developed in organizations in China in order to address the diverse needs and preferences of women managers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Guest Editors’ Introduction: Is the HRM Process Important? Past, Current, and Future Challenges
Author-Name: Sanders, Karin

Author-Name: Gomes, Jorge F. S.
Abstract: Ten years ago, Bowen and Ostroff (2004) criticized the one-sided focus on the content-based approach, where researchers take into account the inherent virtues (or vices) associated with the content of HR practices to explain performance. They explicitly highlight the role of the psychological processes through which employees attach meaning to HRM. In this first article of the special section entitled “Is the HRM Process Important?” we present an overview of past, current, and future challenges. For past challenges, we attempt to categorize the various research streams that originated from the seminal piece. To outline current challenges, we present the results of a content analysis of the original 15 articles put forward for the special section. In addition, we provide the overview of a caucus focused on this theme that was held at the Academy of Management annual meeting in Boston in 2012. In conclusion, we discuss future challenges relating to the HRM process approach and review the contributions that have been selected—against a competitive field—for this special issue. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A Meta‐analytic Integration and Test of Psychological Climate Dimensionality
Author-Name: Benzer, Justin
Author-Name: Horner, Margaret
Abstract: There is no consensus as to what constructs should be considered to be psychological climate. Further, there is no clear taxonomy of psychological climate, although the climate literature suggests that psychological climate perceptions should form higher-order (i.e., abstract, broad) dimensions. Two meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate higher-order frameworks, but neither study tested the psychometric structure of their hypothesized models. The current meta-analysis estimated the intercorrelations and criterion-related validity of 23 psychological climate constructs in order to test the theoretical frameworks proposed by prior meta-analyses. Confirmatory factor analyses supplemented by a method analogous to item-to-scale correlations indicated little empirical support for the a priori frameworks. Results suggest that that psychological climate may be parsimoniously represented by two dimensions. Task climate was most strongly indicated by supervisor goal setting, innovation, and organizational responsiveness. Relational climate was most strongly indicated by work group warmth and social rewards. A path analysis was estimated to test whether job satisfaction partially mediated the association between psychological climate and the outcomes of job performance, turnover intentions, and psychological well-being. Results provide guidance to researchers and practitioners interested in measuring perceptions of the work environment. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: What, When, and with Whom? Investigating Expatriate Reentry Training with a Proximal Approach
Author-Name: Szkudlarek, Betina
Author-Name: Sumpter, Dana McDaniel
Abstract: While reentry transition has long been regarded as one of the most challenging phases of an expatriate assignment cycle, reentry training has received little scholarly attention. Using a qualitative research design based on interviews with 31 training providers, we bring the issue of reentry training into focus. Our findings shed light on three components of training design and execution: content, timing, and participant format. Our comparison of actual reentry training practice with an ideal, theory-driven design revealed numerous inconsistencies. Further investigation of these inconsistencies led us to theorize how training practices may predominantly be shaped by contextual factors. Our findings accentuate the challenges of HRM practices more broadly, showing how practice design can be driven by logistical matters and organizational interests, rather than by evidence-based precepts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study addresses organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) development by examining the role of perceptions of employer psychological contract fulfillment, and the self-regulatory processes by which OBSE evolves and produces its effects. Self-regulatory theory helps reveal why psychological contract fulfillment relates to OBSE, how OBSE mediates its effects, and the ways in which OBSE might interact with perceived employment opportunities to affect job satisfaction, performance, and turnover intentions. The results show that OBSE is related to and mediates the relationships between relational contract fulfillment and employee job satisfaction and performance, but OBSE is not related to transactional contract fulfillment. Nor does OBSE mediate the relationships between transactional contract fulfillment and the dependent variables. Perceived employment opportunities moderate the relationships of OBSE with job satisfaction and turnover intentions. This study concludes with recommendations of ways managers can increase their sensitivity to the types of messages they communicate to employees. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Why Complementary HRM Practices Impact Performance: The Case of Rewards, Job Design, and Work Climate in a Knowledge‐Sharing Context
Author-Name: Foss, Nicolai J.
Author-Name: Pedersen, Torben
Author-Name: Reinholt Fosgaard, Mia
Author-Name: Stea, Diego
Abstract: The strategic HRM literature suggests that HRM influences employees in combinations of practices that “fit” each other rather than as stand-alone practices; however, it pays little attention to the underlying individual-level mechanisms. In contrast, the HRM literature on knowledge sharing examines the influence of single practices on individual-level knowledge sharing, but fails to include the influence of combinations of practices. We link the idea of fit between practices to employee motivation for knowledge sharing by arguing that rewards may be ambiguous and difficult to interpret, but that such ambiguity may be reduced if rewards are combined with other aligned HRM practices, notably job design and work climate. Thus, fit is established through the ambiguity-reducing effect of combining specific HRM practices. Accordingly, we test for complementarities among rewards, job design, and work climate in the form of a three-way interaction among these variables with respect to their impact on knowledge-sharing motivation. Our analysis of 1,523 employees in five knowledge-intensive firms shows that employees who are exposed to knowledge-sharing rewards experience higher levels of autonomous motivation to share when they are simultaneously exposed to a noncontrolling job design and work climate that support knowledge sharing. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we investigate how various types of job training impact upon employees’ job satisfaction and its domains. We find that orientation training exerts a significant positive effect on newcomer male employees’ job satisfaction in both the private and public sectors, but it increases the job satisfaction of newcomer female employees only in the public sector. Other types of job training have only a weak effect on job satisfaction. We attribute the predominance of orientation training as a strong predictor of job satisfaction to its important function of facilitating the workplace socialization of new employees by reducing the uncertainty about aspects of the job that are not always easily contractible. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Greenberg, Danna N.
Abstract: The work reentry period following the birth of a first child is a time of uncertainty for a professional woman. During reentry, a new mother is often questioning who she is and how effective she can be as a mother and working professional. In this study, we conceptualize reentry as a period of resocialization as we explore the first-time mother's changing self-concept during this time. Specifically, we develop a model that explores the identity and efficacy uncertainties that women experience during resocialization. This model draws attention to the influence organizational context has on the degree of uncertainty women experience and to the adjustment tactics women engage to manage their identity and efficacy uncertainty. We discuss the implications these findings have for both socialization research and work-life theory and practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of the perceived congruity of recruitment advertisements and organizational image on organizational attractiveness. Based on Mandler's schema congruity theory (1982) and on recruitment research, we developed hypotheses and tested them on a sample of 1,091 individuals. The results show that recruitment advertisements that conform to the organization's image show a higher degree of attractiveness to applicants, particularly because these advertisements have higher resulting credibility than advertisements with low congruity. Furthermore, applicants’ level of familiarity with the organization moderates the relationship between congruity and organizational attractiveness, as congruent recruitment advertisements lead to more positive effects for well-known organizations. This suggests that highly recognizable organizations should use congruent advertisements to unleash the full potential of their recruitment efforts. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The present study examined the commonly held assumption that a low level of work engagement leads to higher turnover intentions and employee deviant behavior. Employee survey results (n = 175) from a manufacturing organization in the United Kingdom showed that employee work engagement correlates negatively with lagged measures of turnover intentions and deviant work behavior directed toward the organization. The results suggest that perceived organizational support moderates the relationship between work engagement and turnover intentions and deviant behaviors directed toward the organization, such that perceived organizational support compensates for relatively low levels of work engagement. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Tensions and Challenges in the Management of Diversity and Inclusion in IT Services Multinationals in India
Author-Name: Donnelly, Rory
Abstract: Information technology (IT) services multinationals in India provide rich environments for the analysis of emerging patterns of diversity and inclusion management. Growing interest in this field of management has been accentuated by claims tabled by the business case and resource-based rationales. However, challenges and tensions potentially undermine not only the viability of these assertions, but also the impact of diversity and inclusion interventions themselves. This article investigates the tensions and challenges faced by a sample of firms in India in relation to age, gender, and intra- and international diversity. The findings shed light on the implications of these tensions for HR management in these organizations, which need to be addressed if the claims put forward by the business- and resource-based perspectives are to be realized and the management of diversity and inclusion is to be successfully aligned with business and HR strategies. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Bauer, Talya N.
Abstract: Although it is a common practice for organizations to communicate with job seekers following application submission, little is known about how applicants react to this correspondence. Drawing from recruitment and organizational justice theories, we explore the possibility that specific correspondence content influences job seekers’ fairness perceptions. Data collected from 119 actual job applicants indicated that providing relevant information about the recruitment process (information adequacy) positively related to informational and interpersonal justice perceptions. However, delivering this information in an interpersonally sensitive manner (information sensitivity) had a stronger impact on interpersonal justice perceptions. Finally, post hoc analyses suggested that incorporating specific content delivered in initial job applicant correspondence could allow recruiting organizations to develop practical, cost-effective strategies for enhancing job seekers’ fairness perceptions following their application submission. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the cross-cultural differences in human resource (HR) managers’ beliefs in effective HR practices by surveying HR practitioners in Finland (N = 86), South Korea (N = 147), and Spain (N = 196). Similar to previous studies from the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, there are large discrepancies between HR practitioner beliefs and research findings, particularly in the area of staffing. In addition, we find that interpersonal-oriented aspects of HR practices tend to be more culturally bound than technical-oriented aspects of HR practices. We interpret the differences using Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism versus Collectivism, Masculinity versus Femininity, Long-Term Orientation versus Short-Term Orientation, and Uncertainty Avoidance). We discuss the overall nature of the science-practice gap in HR management, and the implications for evidence-based management. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: A scenario study was conducted to determine the impact of identity congruence on selection decisions. Participants were provided identical resumes for either Alejandro or Consuela followed by information from reference checks. Hypotheses were developed to test the impact of finding out information that called into question the Latino/a identity of the applicants. Results were strongest for gender and, consistent with the study's hypotheses, participants favored Alejandro prior to the reference check information. The results also demonstrated the importance of conducting reference checks as the evaluations between the applicants were equalized once the additional information was provided. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: While there is increasing pressure to work collaboratively in interprofessional teams, health professionals often continue to operate in uni-professional silos. Leader inclusiveness is directed toward encouraging and valuing the different viewpoints of diverse members within team interactions, and has significant potential to overcome barriers to interprofessional team performance. In order to better understand the influence of leader inclusiveness, we develop and investigate a model of its effect incorporating two mediated pathways. We predict that leader inclusiveness enhances interprofessional team performance through an increase in shared team identity and a reduction in perceived status differences, and we argue that the latter pathway is contingent on professional diversity. Data from 346 members of 75 teams support our model, with team identity and perceived status differences mediating a significant effect of leader inclusiveness on performance. In addition, we found support for the moderating role of professional diversity. The results reinforce the critical role of leader inclusiveness in diverse teams, particularly interprofessional teams, and suggest that social identity and perceived status differences are critical factors mediating its impact on performance. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Role of Participative Leadership and Trust‐Based Mechanisms in Eliciting Intern Performance: Evidence from China
Author-Name: Newman, Alexander

Author-Name: Teo, Stephen T. T.
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the relationship between participative leadership and job performance within the internship setting. Based on two-waves of survey data obtained from 309 intern-supervisor dyads, we find that participative leadership has a positive relationship with job performance, and that affective trust mediates that relationship. We also find that although cognitive trust is not significantly related to intern job performance, it mediates the relationship between participative leadership and affective trust. Our findings contradict those of previous research which question the effectiveness of participative leadership in short-term employment situations such as internships. They also highlight the importance of designing internships to be reflective of typical performance situations, characterized by participative leadership practices, rather than more directive leadership practices. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The HRM Process Approach: The Influence of Employees’ Attribution to Explain the HRM‐Performance Relationship
Author-Name: Sanders, Karin
Author-Name: Yang, Huadong
Abstract: In an experimental study and a field study, we studied whether high-commitment human resource management (HC-HRM) is more effective when employees can make sense of HRM (attribute HRM to management). In the experimental study (n = 354), employees’ HC-HRM perceptions were evoked by a management case, and their attributions were manipulated with an information pattern based on the three dimensions of the covariation principle of the attribution theory: distinctiveness, consistency, and consensus. As expected, the results showed that the effect of HC-HRM on affective organizational commitment was stronger when employees understood HRM as was intended by management. This experimental finding was confirmed in a cross-level field study (n = 639 employees within 42 organizations): the relationship between HC-HRM, on one hand, and affective organizational commitment and innovative behavior, on the other hand, was stronger under the condition that employees could make sense of HRM. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Building Multiunit Ambidextrous Organizations—A Transformative Framework
Author-Name: Chebbi, Hela

Abstract: A pragmatic “holy grail” of organizational aspirations, ambidexterity is increasingly gaining the attention of executives and scholars alike, presenting them with a frame of thought and a functional strategic attitude that befits the perplexing nature of contemporary business contexts. Aiming to cover one of the most noticeable gaps in knowledge on the subject, this exploratory research studies the evolutionary process of a divisional multi-business-unit organization to an ambidextrous one. We thus identify the determinants of a successful evolution and propose an executive-oriented comprehensive model towards divisionalized ambidexterity. In this context, we answer critical questions relating to the relative weight of innovation within multiunit business ambidexterity, the requisite means and aims of the structural and contextual determinants of success, and the role of top management. We conclude that there is a strategic need for balance between internal and external congruence; and that multiunit integration must be such as to achieve an internal solidification of systems and processes, as well as external adaptability and market flexibility; all within an incessantly changing and unpredictable business environment. The value of the research to human resource management knowledge lies in its focus on multiunit business ambidextrous evolution; and in its consequential scientifically founded practical elucidations of executive worth. Equally importantly, though, the findings transcend theoretical constrictions to provide an in-context business perspective through a comprehensive system that considers also strategic and environmental realities. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Mom, Tom J. M.
Author-Name: Fourné, Sebastian P. L.
Author-Name: Jansen, Justin J. P.
Abstract: Scholars have suggested that we need a better understanding about the drivers and performance implications of managers’ ambidexterity. By building a human resource management perspective on managers’ ambidexterity, this article not only examines organizational and functional tenure as important antecedents, but also provides novel insights into the contextual conditions under which the ambidextrous behavior of managers contributes to individual performance. Based on survey research among managers of two large firms, our results indicate that while organizational tenure contributes to managers’ ambidextrous behavior, functional tenure actually limits such complex behavior. Our study also reveals how managers’ performance results from the interaction between their ambidextrous behavior and the uncertainty as well as the interdependence of their work context. Results indicate that managers’ ambidexterity contributes to individual performance in more uncertain and interdependent work contexts. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Human Resource Practices on Actual and Perceived Organizational Performance in a Middle Eastern Emerging Market
Author-Name: Darwish, Tamer K.
Author-Name: Singh, Satwinder
Author-Name: Wood, Geoffrey
Abstract: This is a study centered on the impact of the specific set of HRM practices on organizational performance (OP) within an emerging-market setting. It seeks to explore which HR practices are most closely associated with better OP within the financial services industry in Jordan based on a survey of managers and the annual reports of the companies encompassed by the study. It was found that the only HR practice seen to consistently impact on OP was training; in other words, we did not encounter any recognizable “bundle” of HR practices that optimized OP across the sector. We argue that this reflects the weaker and more partially coupled nature of institutions in many emerging markets, which makes it difficult to generate the type of complementarities associated between regulation and practice in mature markets. It also reflects the limited transferability of perceived best practice models in the context of emerging-market settings. Although belied by objective firm performance data, many respondents believed that it was not only training but also the extensive usage of extrinsic incentives (pay and promotion) that would translate into superior results. This highlights the limitations of relying on managerial reported performance data in exploring the consequences of specific HR practices. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study seeks to advance previous research by linking top management team (TMT) processes to organizational ambidexterity, and highlights the importance of environmental dynamism as a boundary condition on the effectiveness of TMTs in promoting balance between exploratory and exploitative learning. The findings from multiple respondents (245 TMT members, including the CEO of the SBUs, and 883 employees) in 101 small-sized strategic business units (SBUs) with a defined product line indicate that TMT behavioral integration helps build ambidexterity, but that the influence of TMT behavioral integration on ambidexterity is stronger when the task environment is characterized by a high level of dynamism. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the conditions under which behaviorally integrated TMTs are able to pursue an ambidextrous orientation in relatively small-sized units. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Principles and Applications of Multilevel Modeling in Human Resource Management Research
Author-Name: Shen, Jie
Abstract: Multilevel modeling is important for human resource management (HRM) research in that it often analyzes and interprets hierarchal data residing at more than one level of analysis. However, HRM research in general lags behind other disciplines, such as education, health, marketing, and psychology in the use of a multilevel analytical strategy. This article integrates the most recent literature into the theoretical and applied basics of multilevel modeling applicable to HRM research. A range of multilevel modeling issues have been discussed and they include statistical logic underpinning multilevel modeling, level conceptualization of variables, data aggregation, hypothesis tests, reporting mediation paths, and cross-level interactions. An empirical example concerning complex cross-level mediated moderation is presented that will suffice to illustrate the principles and the procedures for implementing a multilevel analytical strategy in HRM research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Top executives hold positions that convey power, prestige, and competence as predicted by status characteristics theory. Nevertheless, the impressions generated through this status characteristic may be vulnerable when executives also possess characteristics that reflect a devalued social identity, such as obesity. Data from health examinations and multisource evaluation surveys of 757 CEOs, vice presidents, and upper managers suggest that the observable cue of umbilical waist circumference is negatively associated with evaluations of leaders across hierarchical levels, even after controlling for Body Mass Index, physical activity, personality, and demographic characteristics. Thus, hierarchically based status characteristics are insufficient in overcoming the stigma of obesity: even CEOs are subject to the pernicious effects of obesity stigma. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Behavioral Ambidexterity: The Impact of Incentive Schemes on Productivity, Motivation, and Performance of Employees in Commercial Banks
Author-Name: Faisal Ahammad, Mohammad
Author-Name: Mook Lee, Sang

Author-Name: Shoham, Amir
Abstract: Human resource management systems may serve as an antecedent that enables firms to develop a context for ambidexterity—an ability to pursue contradictory processes (exploitation versus exploration) within the same firm. The aim of this article is to examine the impact of motivation-enhancing HR practices on the productivity, motivation, and performance of commercial bank employees to promote and attain contextual ambidexterity within the organization. The theoretical model presented in this article shows how ex-ante incentives (incentives based on past performance) and ex-post incentives (incentives based on future performance) affect productivity, motivation, and performance of employees. The results are tested empirically by analyzing real quarterly data of commercial bank employees in Israel. The main results show that workers with relatively high abilities might take advantage of both ex-ante and ex-post incentives. In contrast, workers with relatively low ability are unable to take advantage of both incentive schemes. Our findings indicate that motivation-enhancing HR practices such as financial incentives significantly influence the productivity and performance of employees. Our study contributes to the ambidexterity literature by examining how motivation-enhancing human resource (HR) practices such as incentive schemes make employees feel the sense of stretch that is essential in building an ambidextrous organization. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Role of Authentic Leadership in Fostering Workplace Inclusion: A Social Information Processing Perspective
Author-Name: Boekhorst, Janet A.
Abstract: The extant literature has largely overlooked the importance of a climate for inclusion as a response to the growing trend of workplace diversity. This conceptual article contends that an organization-wide change effort comprising several reinforcing processes aimed at creating a climate for inclusion is needed to institutionalize workplace inclusion. Drawing on social information processing theory, authentic leaders are posited to transmit social information about the importance of inclusion into the work environment through inclusive leader role modeling. Reward systems that remunerate inclusive conduct can foster the vicarious learning of inclusive conduct by followers. Large and diverse workgroups offer a plethora of opportunities for followers to learn how to behave in an inclusive manner. Authentic leaders and followers who share cooperative goals related to developing a climate for inclusion can prompt the vicarious learning of inclusive behaviors by followers, thereby facilitating goal attainment for both parties. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Proell, Chad A.

Abstract: Today's human resource management community has a strong interest in the issue of how HR practice is implemented by managers and leaders in the workplace. In this article, we investigate how one specific practice, leaders’ public recognition of a job well done (i.e., credit allocation), impacts employee turnover. Based on expectancy violations, psychological contracts, and turnover research, we predicted that subordinates would be more likely to leave an organization if their leader took credit for their work, but only if the credit taking violated subordinates’ expectations. In a field survey of organizational employees, we found that the effects of credit taking on turnover were negated when subordinates’ expectations and leaders’ credit allocation behavior were aligned. However, when leaders’ credit behavior came as a surprise, participants responded negatively when expectations were not met and positively when expectations were exceeded. We discuss the implications of these results for both theory and practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) offer an important tool for rapid organizational growth, acquisition of new knowledge and capabilities, and entry into new markets at home or abroad. Although the importance of the involvement of the human resource management function has been widely extolled, evidence for the level of involvement remains limited. A significant gap in our understanding is created by the observation that not all M&As are motivated by the same objectives. We explore the significance of different forms of M&A for the scope and intensity of involvement of the human resource management function by examining a set of three cases of different M&As conducted by a single firm in Italy. The cases provide evidence that we should expect HR functional involvement to vary across the type of M&A. We offer a conceptual framework with testable propositions for scholars interested in further exploring these relationships. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How Top Management HR Beliefs and Values Affect High‐Performance Work System Adoption and Implementation Effectiveness
Author-Name: Arthur, Jeffrey B.
Author-Name: Herdman, Andrew O.
Author-Name: Yang, Jaewan
Abstract: What explains why high-performance work systems (HPWSs) are not adopted more widely by firms that would appear to benefit economically by adopting them? We address this question by drawing on the upper-echelons perspective to consider the role of the top managers’ beliefs concerning the financial payoffs from investments in HR (“HR cause-effect belief”) as well as their employee-centered value-based beliefs (labeled “HPWS values”). We propose a conceptual model in which top management HPWS values moderate the relationship between HR cause-effect beliefs and the intensity of HPWS programs reported by managers as well as the relationship between HPWS programs and employees’ perceptions of implemented HPWS practices. We test our model using a unique multisource data set collected from 120 hotel franchisees that includes survey responses from 648 managers and 1,293 employees. We find that firms’ ability to translate top managers’ cause-effect beliefs about the economic value of HR investments into adoption of HPWS programs, as well as their ability to effectively implement these HPWS programs, is significantly affected by the value-based HR beliefs held by top managers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Bruch, Heike
Abstract: With this article we contribute to the inclusion of employees with disabilities in the workplace. Based on Stone and Colella's (1996) model of factors affecting the treatment of employees with disabilities in organizations, we concentrate on the investigation of job satisfaction as a focal affective response. Besides examining job satisfaction differences between employees with and without disabilities, we focus on perceived flexibility as an organizational boundary condition, arguing for its influence on the job satisfaction of employees with disabilities. We introduce perceived centralization and formalization, representing different indicators of flexibility, as moderators of the disability–job satisfaction relationship. Regression analysis using data from 110 small and medium-sized companies with 4,141 employees reveals that employees with disabilities are less satisfied than their colleagues without disabilities in highly centralized environments. As predicted, a decentralized organizational context relates to higher job satisfaction levels for all employees, but especially for those having a disability. Contrary to our hypothesis, perceived formalization does not significantly influence the relationship between having a disability and job satisfaction. However, our results clearly indicate the need for companies and especially human resource departments to better adapt to the needs of people with disabilities by creating flexible working environments. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The present study generalizes previous pay dispersion research to the Chinese context by examining the cross-level relationship between workgroup salary dispersion and employee turnover intention contingent on individual differences. Field survey data including annual objective salary and self-reported attitudes among 370 Chinese employees in 51 organizational workgroups supported our cultural predictions by showing that the relationship between workgroup salary dispersion and turnover intention was positive only among employees with higher rather than lower levels of Chinese traditionality and among those with lower rather than higher salary levels. Furthermore, the results of mediated moderation analyses suggest that a dual-deprivation path model can explain the above relationships. We discuss the theoretical, cultural, and practical implications of these findings for organizations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: An increasingly diverse labor pool has increased the likelihood that HR recruiters will encounter job seekers who speak with different dialects. Prior studies have investigated the effects of applicant dialect on employment selection outcomes. In this article, we merge this research with stereotyping, “modern racism,” and sociolinguistics literatures to formulate propositions surrounding two questions of interest: (1) Do prospective employers categorize job applicants using sociolinguistic cues? and (2) If so, what impact does this categorization have on evaluations of applicant employability? We believe this research can provide significant insights into HR practice as discriminatory behaviors change and adapt to fit social norms, particularly in employee recruitment and selection contexts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We study the resilience of the “100 Best Companies to Work for in America” in times of financial crisis by analyzing their long-term financial performance. Apart from implementing methods that tackle the statistical problems of stock returns, we use a conditional model to measure financial performance in periods of market growth (bull markets) and market downturn (bear markets). We find that best places to work are indeed resilient in times of crisis since neither their financial performance nor their systematic risk are affected during bear markets: top companies continue to outperform the market during periods of crisis, and the performance of lower-ranked great workplaces does not deteriorate. Moreover, we find that previous studies were overestimating performance, and only great workplaces on the top half of the rankings exhibit positive excessive returns. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: To Thine Shareholders Be True? Linking Large Corporate Ownership to Firms’ Use of Commitment Human Resource Practices
Author-Name: Mullins, Frank

Author-Name: Dharwadkar, Ravi
Abstract: Human resource practitioners and academics have increasingly realized the importance of corporate governance for firm human resource activities. This study investigates how one important form of corporate governance, namely, ownership within large, publicly traded firms, is associated with a firm's use of commitment human resource practices (CHRPs), specifically, the use of incentive compensation, profit sharing, and participative decision making. Our findings indicate that the types of large investor, namely, family and institutional, are differentially associated with the likelihood of the firm using these CHRPs. Specifically, family owners with their long-term investment horizon, as well as their stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of the firm using these practices. In contrast, large institutional owners with their shorter-term investment horizon, as well as their investor orientation, decrease the likelihood of the firm using these practices. Furthermore, among institutional investors, transient institutional investors are negatively associated with these practices, while dedicated institutional investors are not associated with these practices. Taken together, our results regarding the positive association of family ownership and this subset of CHRPs and the negative association of transient institutional investors and this set of practices, have important implications for human resource professionals who not only need to understand how ownership affects HR practices but also how to articulate the value of these investments in order to attract investors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We studied the problem of rating-level bias and rating accuracy among retail managers of a Fortune 500 retailer. Hypotheses were tested regarding the relationship among managers’ Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality characteristics, their competence in performance management, and their levels of bias and accuracy in appraisals made in situations differing on levels of rater accountability. Associate store managers (N = 125) rated subordinates, peers and managers under conditions of high and low rater accountability. We found support for the stability of rating-level bias across rating situations. Raters’ levels of agreeableness and assertiveness were related to mean rating levels across situations, and U-shaped relationships were found in predicting one measure of rating accuracy such that high and low levels of these two traits were related to greater rating inaccuracy. Conscientiousness scores were significantly (and negatively) correlated with highly accountable mean ratings of subordinates. Performance management competence was related to rating-level bias in both high- and low-accountability conditions and contributed incremental validity in the prediction of rating level and rating accuracy. Our results indicate that the most lenient raters are more agreeable, less assertive, and less competent in performance management. These raters may also be less accurate. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Age and Assessments of Disability Accommodation Request Normative Appropriateness
Author-Name: Baldridge, David C.
Author-Name: Swift, Michele L.
Abstract: In the United States, the labor force continues to age. As age increases, so does the likeliness of needing disability accommodation. Prior research indicates that people with disabilities often do not request needed accommodations when they assess that others at work would perceive a request as normatively inappropriate. Little, however, is currently known about the impact of age on these assessments. In this study, we integrate prior research on age, disability, social identity, and climate to propose and then test a model of the relationship between requesters’ age and their normative assessments using survey data from 242 people who became hearing impaired prior to entering the workforce. As hypothesized, requester age was negatively associated with normative appropriateness assessment favorability. Moreover, this negative influence was stronger in for-profit organizational contexts and in workgroup contexts in which the requester lacked a coworker with a disability. Having a coworker with a similar disability also partially mediated the moderating effect of organization type on the association between age and normative appropriateness assessment favorability. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Performance Management: Perceiving Goals as Invariable and Implications for Perceived Job Autonomy and Work Performance
Author-Name: Kuvaas, Bård
Author-Name: Buch, Robert
Author-Name: Dysvik, Anders
Abstract: In this study, we investigated whether perceiving goals as invariable is negatively related to work performance and whether this relationship is mediated by perceived job autonomy. Perceiving goals as invariable refers to the extent to which employees believe that the goals in a performance management system represent absolute standards that they must meet without exception, even if they think other factors are more important (e.g., situational factors or factors that are not associated with goals). In support of our hypotheses, we found a negative relationship between perceiving goals as invariable and work performance and that perceived job autonomy mediated this relationship. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Bridging Role of Expatriates and Inpatriates in Knowledge Transfer in Multinational Corporations
Author-Name: Harzing, Anne‐Wil

Author-Name: Sebastian Reiche, B.
Abstract: Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article provides the first empirical study that explicitly investigates the relationship between different categories of international assignees and knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNCs). Specifically, we examine (1) the extent to which expatriate presence in different functional areas is related to knowledge transfer from and to headquarters in these functions and (2) the extent to which different categories of international assignees (expatriates vs. inpatriates) contribute to knowledge transfer from and to headquarters. We base our investigation on a large-scale survey, encompassing data from more than 800 subsidiaries of MNCs in 13 countries. By disaggregating the role of knowledge transfer across management functions, directions of knowledge transfer, and type of international assignees, we find that (1) expatriate presence generally increases function-specific knowledge transfer from and, to a lesser extent, to headquarters; and that (2) the relevance of expatriates and former inpatriates varies for knowledge flows between headquarters and subsidiaries. Additionally, we discuss implications for research and practice, in particular regarding different management functions and different forms of international assignments, and provide suggestions for future research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Creativity‐Performance Relationship: How Rewarding Creativity Moderates the Expression of Creativity
Author-Name: Sue‐Chan, Christina
Author-Name: Hempel, Paul S.
Abstract: Researchers have argued that creativity is intrinsically motivated, and that rewarding creativity can stifle creativity. Using a sample of 310 employees reporting to 50 different supervisors, we instead show that rewarding creativity influences the relationship between creativity and performance by changing the nature of expressed creativity. We do this by examining novelty and usefulness as separate dimensions. High perceived reward enhances the relationship between novelty and performance while diminishing the relationship between usefulness and performance. The moderating effect of reward for creativity on the relationship between creativity and performance was not observed when we operationalized creativity as an integrated, unidimensional construct. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: How Strategic Focus Relates to the Delivery of Leadership Training and Development
Author-Name: Clarke, Nicholas
Author-Name: Higgs, Malcolm
Abstract: Despite progress in the development of leadership development models over recent years, these models fail to account for the differentiation in leadership training and development (LTD) practices found between organizations. We conducted an exploratory, multiple case study of formal leadership training and development in 10 organizations, in different business sectors in the United Kingdom. We show that the strategic focus of LTD was shaped by the business goals pursued by these 10 organizations. We also found the strategic focus of LTD to be a broad contingency factor differentiated by level of impact, which then influenced the pattern of LTD delivery. The findings offer support for a contingency perspective in explaining how leadership training and development is configured in differing organizational contexts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Guest Editors’ Introduction: People Management and Emerging Market Multinationals
Author-Name: Wilkinson, Adrian
Author-Name: Wood, Geoffrey
Author-Name: Demirbag, Mehmet
Abstract: There is a very extensive body of literature on how multinationals manage their people in different national contexts. However, the bulk of this literature focuses on the case of multinationals from the advanced industrial economies, and to a considerable extent, the United States. Very much less has been written on multinationals with their country of origin being an emerging market, and what little there is has focused on a very limited number of preferred cases. The growing importance of emerging economies has led to an upsurge of strategy research on the topic (Wright, Filatotchev, Hoskisson, & Peng, 2005); however, research on human resource management has not paid enough attention to emerging market multinational enterprises (EMNEs). Many EMNEs tend to be smaller in size with considerably fewer resources and less international experience than their counterparts from developed markets, limiting their ability to transfer management practice across their subsidiaries (Thite, Wilkinson, & Shah, 2012), although there are important exceptions to this rule. This introductory article seeks to contribute to the emerging body of literature in this area, through seeking to encourage fresh insights, particularly on the varieties of people management encountered in different national contexts. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: “It's All About Time”: Time as Contested Terrain in the Management and Experience of Domiciliary Care Work in England
Author-Name: Rubery, Jill
Author-Name: Grimshaw, Damian
Author-Name: Hebson, Gail
Author-Name: Ugarte, Sebastian M.
Abstract: Drawing on a multilevel study of commissioning, employers, and care staff, this article explores the role of time in the management of domiciliary care work for older adults in England and the consequences for the employment conditions of care staff. An index of fragmented time practices among 52 independent-sector domiciliary care providers reveals widespread tendencies to use zero-hours contracts and limit paid hours to face-to-face contact time, leaving travel time and other work-related activities unpaid. Care staff interviews reveal how fragmented time creates insecurities and demands high work engagement. Time management practices are shown to derive directly from strict time-based local authority commissioning. Subcontractors, both independent small firms and those belonging to national chains, can at best adopt human resource (HR) policies that are partial routes to failure, as evident in widespread recruitment and retention problems. Informal HR practices to accommodate working-time preferences help to retain individual staff, but adjustments are often marginal, adversely affect other staff and fail to expand the recruitment pool for social care. Labor shortages are likely to persist as long as workers are required to adapt to a regime of fragmented time and to work more hours than are paid, even at pay rates close to the national minimum wage. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Purpose of Expatriation: Why Women Undertake International Assignments
Author-Name: Shortland, Susan
Abstract: Women international assignees have historically been successful, but they make up a relatively low proportion of organizationally assigned expatriates. By appreciating the factors that encourage women to undertake internationally mobile careers, organizations can widen their talent pool. Using a triangulated, qualitative research approach set within two case study firms in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, this article identifies contrasting views between female assignees and their organizations with respect to the purpose of expatriation and the factors women take into consideration in their decision to undertake it. This research is based on analysis of organizational policy; a survey of 71 women expatriates and in-depth, semistructured interviews with 26 female assignees (selected from the survey returns using stratified sampling); and interviews with 14 human resource professionals responsible for international mobility policy design and implementation. Career, family, and financial precondition effects are identified. From these, a model is proposed to link stated organizational assignment purpose with women's participation rationales, and recommendations for practice to increase expatriate gender diversity are set out. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: We develop and test a mediation model linking job insecurity to affective commitment and psychosomatic complaints via two distinct theoretical mechanisms: fairness and energy depletion. Analyses were based on 6,268 Belgian bank employees facing organizational change. Results from structural equation modeling showed that fairness and exhaustion partially mediated the association of job insecurity with affective commitment and psychosomatic complaints, respectively. Multiple group analysis showed that the relation between job insecurity and fairness gradually decreased across the three change stages, and that the exhaustion process was most prominent amid the change.

Author-Name: Francia, Arthur J.
Abstract: We suggest that a firm's benefits can relate to important organizational outcomes that have strategic implications. We propose a number of mechanisms that could relate benefits to strategic outcomes, including the notion that benefits can help attract and retain the type of employees who are most likely to perform in ways consistent with the firms’ strategies. We illustrate this with the case of supplemental retirement benefits in an actual setting, the long-haul trucking industry. We report positive organization-level relationships associated with the management choice of offering these benefits. Our results show that firms offering supplemental retirement plans engage in significantly safer driving practices, as measured by the proxy of driver insurance costs, as hypothesized. These findings show that benefits can be related to outcomes that have strategic implications for the firm. By showing that retirement plans may be of value to organizations, we help to bridge the academic-practitioner divide and provide motivation and guidance for additional work on this important but underresearched topic. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Crowding Out Reciprocity between Working Parents and Companies with Corporate Childcare
Author-Name: Feierabend, Anja
Author-Name: Staffelbach, Bruno
Abstract: When the government and companies invest in childcare, both do it with good intentions. While politicians have the intention of enhancing fertility and well-being of families, employers expect positive responses from working parents based on the norm of reciprocity. Since industrialized countries increase public family support year by year, the question arises as to whether this may trigger unanticipated consequences. If both the state and companies invest in substitutive services, they might unintentionally spark competition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether public childcare may “crowd out” the reciprocity effects of corporate childcare on working parents. In Switzerland, state family policies vary among the 26 cantons, so we are able to compare cantons with a high and low number of cantonal childcare services. Using survey data taken from 414 working parents living in different Swiss cantons, we examined whether public childcare affects organizational-related responses of working parents. First, our results support the expected level of reciprocity: working parents in companies with their own childcare services show higher organizational commitment than parents in companies without this support. Second, we find evidence for a crowding-out effect: in family-supportive cantons with numerous public childcare services, working parents’ commitment to companies with their own childcare services is lower than in less family-friendly cantons. This finding reignites an old economic debate on the crowding out of voluntary private investments due to governmental policies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Organizational ambidexterity has emerged as a valuable contemporary lens on organizational design and action, examining the dynamic relationships between exploitative (extant) and explorative (evolving) resources within organizational contexts and environments. This article analyzes the literature pertaining to ambidexterity and underlines a number of recurrent preoccupations including definition of the nature, characteristics, and normative boundaries of organizational ambidexterity; a predilection toward considering interfirm/unit comparisons of large-scale corporate organizations; and a concentration on the significance of the managerialistic role of the senior management team's disposition and action-orientations. While a few calls have been made for a focus on the micro-aspects, predominant attention has remained on the macro-aspects of organizational ambidexterity.

Abstract: This article explores the ways in which employees may experience and respond to tensions inherent in the mix of potentially conflicting human resource (HR) practices that compose hybrid models of employment relations. By drawing on the job demands–resources (JD-R) literature and viewing HR practices as “demands” and “resources,” we explore the impact of performance management and employee voice practices on employee well-being, as exemplified by engagement and emotional exhaustion, in a large public-sector organization in Ireland. Our findings suggest that employee voice mechanisms may act as a resource in both enhancing engagement and in counterbalancing the demands presented by a performance management system, thus reducing the deleterious effects of emotional exhaustion. Our study extends understanding of hybrid models of human resource management (HRM) and of the ways in which employees manage the contradictory signals that such models may send in terms of performance expectations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Multiple Disadvantage and Wage Growth: The Effect of Merit Pay on Pay Gaps
Author-Name: Woodhams, Carol

Author-Name: Cowling, Marc
Abstract: This article concerns rates of wage growth among women and minority groups and their impact on pay gaps. Specifically, it focuses on the pay progression of people with more than one disadvantaged identity, and on the impact of merit pay. Recent research indicates that pay gaps for people in more than one disadvantaged identity category are wider than those with a single-disadvantaged identity. It is not known whether these gaps are closing, at what rate, and whether all groups are affected equally; nor is it known whether merit pay alleviates or exacerbates existing pay gaps. In addressing these issues, the analysis draws on longitudinal payroll data from a large UK-based organization. Results show that pay gaps are closing; however, the rate of convergence is slow relative to the size of existing pay disparities, and slowest of all for people with disabilities. When the effect of merit pay is isolated, it is found to have a small positive effect in reducing pay gaps, and this effect is generally larger for dual/multiple-disadvantaged groups. These findings run counter to the well-established critique of merit pay in relation to equality outcomes. The implications of this are discussed, and an agenda for research and practice is set out. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Strategic Staffing and Small‐Firm Performance

Abstract: Although staffing can be a critical determinant of whether small businesses succeed or fail, there has been less research in this area than might be expected, given the large numbers of such firms. While there has been some research on specific recruiting and selection practices, there has been little attention to the strategic aspects of staffing. We investigated relationships between strategic approaches to staffing and small-firm performance using lagged survey data from 139 founders and owners of small firms. Results indicate that recruiting approaches imitating the practices (processes) of larger businesses are positively related to a perceptual measure of firm performance. Selection approaches stressing a growth orientation are also positively related to firm performance. Finally, founders’ and owners’ perceptions of the strategic importance of human resources moderate the relationship of firm performance with imitative recruiting practices as well as with growth-oriented selection practices. An important contribution of this article is that contextual knowledge facilitates our understanding of the performance implications of staffing practices in small firms. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress that organizations have made during the past 20 years to increase the representation of women at board level, they still hold few board seats. Drawing on a qualitative study involving 30 companies with women directors in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ghana, we investigate how the relationship between gender in the boardroom and corporate governance operates. The findings indicate that the presence of a minority of women on the board has an insignificant effect on board performance. Yet the chairperson's role is vital in leading the change for recruiting and evaluating candidates and their commitment to the board with diversity and governance in mind. Our study also sheds light on the multifaceted reasons why women directors appear to be resisting the discourse of gender quotas. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Professionalization and Expertise In Care Work: The Hoarding and Discarding of Tasks in Nursing
Author-Name: Kessler, Ian
Author-Name: Heron, Paul
Author-Name: Dopson, Sue
Abstract: Although health and social care workforces are heavily professionalized, the mainstream human resource management literature has been slow to engage with debates in the field of organizational studies on this distinctive group of employees. This lacuna is addressed by focusing on how the search for more flexible working practices in care services has affected the professions and especially their relationship with their assistant coworkers. The character of this relationship is seen as contingent on the logic of professionalization, in turn based on different notions of expertise, with implications for the allocation of tasks. The article distinguishes between a specialist expertise, encouraging the profession to discard routine tasks, and a holistic expertise, nurturing the hoarding of tasks. This distinction is used to explore the nurse professional project in Britain, a critical case where the statutory regulation of the nursing workforce has remained relatively weak. While noting shifts over the years in the British nursing professions’ adherence to these two logics, workplace data on the nurse–health care assistant relationship reveal a fragmented pattern of nursing work consistent with a specialist-discard logic, albeit underpinned by a residual ambiguity among nurses about their preferred professional logic. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Cyberloafing—using the Internet for non-work-related activities—is a prevalent counterproductive work behavior in the workplace, but researchers have not yet paid sufficient attention to this issue, especially related to the role of personality in cyberloafing. Recognizing such a research gap, and using a trait activation theory framework, this study examines whether conscientiousness and emotional stability negatively relate to cyberloafing. We further investigate how organizational justice perceptions and psychological empowerment moderate the negative relationship between these personality traits and cyberloafing. Based on a sample of 247 employees, we find that those high in conscientiousness cyberloaf less when they perceive greater levels of organizational justice. In addition, highly conscientious individuals cyberloaf less when they have low, rather than high, levels of psychological empowerment. Implications for research and practice as well as future research directions are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: In this article we strive to reconcile equivocal findings about the effects of top leader succession and prior leadership experience on postsuccession organizational performance. In doing so, we draw on insights from theories of human capital, learning, and asymmetric information to better understand the conditions under which leaders increase or decrease postsuccession performance. Employing a sample of 119 newly appointed leaders in the English Premier League (1996–2010), we find the following results. First, relating to the succession event, outside leaders that directly move between leadership positions are associated with higher postsuccession performance while the departure of a prior leader to a leadership position in another organization has a negative effect on postsuccession performance. Second, relating to prior leadership experience, leaders with domestic top leader experience are associated with lower postsuccession performance, while leaders with foreign top leader experience are associated with higher postsuccession performance. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: McCann, Leo

Author-Name: Hassard, John
Author-Name: Hyde, Paula
Abstract: Based on a three-year ethnographic study of four UK National Health Service (NHS) organizations, we explore the everyday cultural experience of managing clinical and administrative workforces. Although NHS organizations claim to function as enlightened HRM employers, we argue that the inflexible application of metrics-based target systems to clinical and administrative tasks, including HRM operations, can result in dysfunctional outcomes for patient care and workforce morale. Reminiscent of the recent Mid Staffordshire health care scandal, the priorities attached to NHS personnel meeting the demands of performance management systems can prove incompatible with them also meeting the fundamental “human” needs of patients. The everyday experience of health care organization becomes one of employees reconciling competing logics of business efficiency and integrity of care. Trapped metaphorically between shrinking resources and expanding targets, the inclination—on the frontline and at mid-management level—is to extend the integrity of care, although this is sometimes impossible and can prove problematic in terms of system accountability. In response to such organizational tensions the behavior of many frontline and mid-management staffs ultimately reflects a form of “street-level bureaucracy”—a situation in which traditional professional norms are reasserted informally in ways that often transgress prescribed performance systems. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Olympic Effect: Employee Reactions to Their Employer's Sponsorship of a High‐Profile Global Sporting Event
Author-Name: Edwards, Martin R.
Abstract: With companies investing vast sums of money on sponsoring high-profile sports events, it is surprising that very little research exists to examine the possible impact that this has on the sponsors’ employees. This two-wave panel study explores the indirect role that Olympic sponsorship and employee support for this sponsorship has on increases in organizational identification and discretionary effort—via, that is, pride and employee assessments of their employer's corporate social responsibility (CSR) credentials. The current study surveyed 241 employees (from three countries) in two phases across a 12-month period in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics. Olympic sponsorship support was found to be positively associated with organizational pride and CSR perceptions, which both predict increases in organizational identification and discretionary effort (controlling for earlier baseline levels of these outcomes). In addition, there is also evidence of an indirect positive effect (through CSR perceptions and pride) of Olympic sponsorship support on increases in organizational identification and discretionary effort. The implications of these findings for decision makers considering sponsoring major sporting events are discussed; the findings provide interesting insights that can help HR functions to understand the consequences of sports sponsorship and processes involved that explain positive employee responses. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Managerial Social Networks and Ambidexterity of SMEs: The Moderating Role of a Proactive Commitment to Innovation
Author-Name: Heavey, Ciaran
Author-Name: Simsek, Zeki
Author-Name: Fox, Brian Curtis
Abstract: Organizational research suggests that ambidexterity is attainable if top managers cultivate collective behavioral routines that enable them to synthesize large amounts of information and decision alternatives, and manage conflict and ambiguity. However, the type of information and knowledge sources that enable top managers to meet the knowledge demands of ambidexterity remains poorly understood. Toward that end, we argue that the extensiveness of top managers’ social networks inside and outside the firm, on an integrative basis, can offer the dual knowledge benefits conducive to ambidexterity. Because ambidexterity entails the firm's departure from existing products, technologies, and practices, we further argue that the contribution of extensive networks to ambidexterity is conditional upon the collective volition of top managers to parlay extensive network opportunities into innovative pursuits. From a study of CEOs and top management teams in SMEs operating in technology-based industries, we find support for both a network extensiveness effect and the moderating role of a proactive commitment to innovation in shaping this effect. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Making Good Things Last Longer: The Role of Savoring on the Relationship Between HRM and Positive Employee Outcomes
Author-Name: Castanheira, Filipa
Author-Name: Story, Joana
Abstract: This work studies sales managers’ perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices, and the mediating and moderating processes through which these practices are linked with affective commitment. Specifically, we tested whether work engagement mediated the relationship between perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices and affective commitment using a sample of 117 sales managers from one large retail store. Furthermore, we tested whether managers’ savoring strategies would moderate the positive relationship between perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices and work engagement, and if the strength of the hypothesized indirect effects were conditional on the use of savoring strategies. Results showed that the relationship between perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices and affective commitment was mediated by work engagement. In addition, savoring strategies were found to moderate the relationship between perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices and work engagement, so that the highest levels of work engagement were found in individuals who reported high perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices and high use of savoring strategies. Finally, results support a conditional indirect effect of performance-oriented HR practices on predicting affective commitment via work engagement when levels of savoring strategies were moderate to high, but not when their use was low. Altogether, these results demonstrated that work engagement and savoring strategies represent key elements in explaining how perceptions of performance-oriented HR practices are associated with affective commitment. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Ambidexterity and Unit Performance: Intellectual Capital Antecedents and Cross‐Level Moderating Effects of Human Resource Practices
Author-Name: Kostopoulos, Konstantinos C.
Author-Name: Bozionelos, Nikos
Author-Name: Syrigos, Evangelos
Abstract: This study develops a cross-level model examining the effects of intellectual capital facets (i.e., human, social, and organizational capital) on unit ambidexterity. Further, it proposes that organizational-level high-performance human resource (HPHR) practices significantly shape these effects as well as the unit ambidexterity–unit performance relationship. Hierarchical linear modeling on multisource and lagged data from a sample of 148 business units from 58 US Fortune 500 firms shows that unit human and social capital positively contributes to unit ambidexterity, unit organizational capital has a negative relationship with unit ambidexterity, and organizational HPHR practices amplify the former and mitigate the latter of these unit-level effects. The findings also reveal that the relationship between ambidexterity and unit performance becomes stronger in organizational contexts of heightened HPHR practices. This multilevel approach increases understanding of how units achieve ambidexterity and attain related performance gains. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Adoption of High‐Performance Work Systems by Local Subsidiaries of Developed Country and Turkish MNEs and Indigenous Firms in Turkey
Author-Name: Demirbag, Mehmet

Author-Name: Wilkinson, Adrian
Abstract: High-performance work systems (HPWSs) are seen as important in helping strengthen competitive strategies of developed-country multinational enterprises (DC MNEs). Commensurate with global competitive pressures and internationalization strategies, emerging-country MNEs (EC MNEs) and indigenous firms are also increasingly adopting HPWSs. HPWSs are not only seen as simply performance enhancing systems, but also as facilitators of internationalization. MNEs represent an important test bed for the HPWSs and their applicability in different national contexts. In this article, we contribute to the extant literature by focusing on HPWS adoption level within domestic subsidiaries of DC MNEs and EC MNEs along with stand-alone indigenous firms in a single-country setting by keeping the host-country environment as constant. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: A Cross‐National Study of Fairness in Asia: How Perceptions of a Lack‐of‐Group Bias and Transparency in the Performance Evaluation System Relate to Job Satisfaction
Author-Name: Yamazaki, Yoshitaka
Author-Name: Yoon, Jeewhan
Abstract: This study explored how managers’ fairness perceptions of performance evaluation systems differ across countries and relate to their job satisfaction. Lack-of-group bias and transparency were the constructs used to assess fairness perceptions. The data sample consisted of 903 Asian managers from the subsidiaries of a leading multinational corporation (MNC) strategically expanding its retail markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Thailand. Results showed that the fairness perceptions of lack-of-group bias and transparency concerning the common performance evaluation system varied within these Asian countries. Furthermore, those fairness perceptions were significantly related to job satisfaction among Asian managers overall, as well as in each of the five geographical subgroups with the exception of Hong Kong, where the perception of a lack-of-group bias was only marginally related to job satisfaction. These findings offer theoretical implications regarding organizational justice, cross-national management, and performance evaluation, as well as practical implications for leveraging organizational justice perceptions of performance evaluation systems for the effectiveness of MNCs. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Understanding the Change–Cynicism Cycle: The Role of HR
Author-Name: Brown, Michelle

Author-Name: Metz, Isabel
Abstract: Employee change cynicism is an unintended consequence of organizational change, which can undermine the effectiveness of change initiatives. Based on social information processing theory, we examine the impact of two human resource roles (administrative expert and strategic change agent) on the relationship between the quantity of organizational change and employee change cynicism. Using multilevel data from 1,831 employees in 70 organizations, we find employees who are exposed to more organizational change report higher levels of change cynicism. However, the strength of the organizational change–cynicism relationship is affected by the role of HR in the employees’ organizations. When HR undertakes an administrative expert role, change is more likely to generate change cynicism. When HR undertakes a strategic change agent role, change is less likely to generate change cynicism. Our results suggest that organizations need to think carefully about the role of HR during organizational change and encourage HR to adopt a strategic change agent role. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: HR Practices and Knowledge Brokering by Hybrid Middle Managers in Hospital Settings: The Influence of Professional Hierarchy
Author-Name: Currie, Graeme
Author-Name: Burgess, Nicola
Author-Name: Hayton, James C.
Abstract: Drawing upon the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) framework, our study extends understanding of the interaction between human resource (HR) practices and the brokering of knowledge by hybrid middle managers. Examining health care delivered to older people in a hospital setting, our study highlights that hybrid nurse middle managers broker knowledge downward through professional hierarchy to their peer group, but find it difficult to broker knowledge upward. Meanwhile, because they lack legitimacy with doctors, they lack the opportunity to broker knowledge interprofessionally. Hybrid medical middle managers are potentially more able to broker knowledge within their peer group. However, some of lower status intraprofessionally, like nurses, may lack legitimacy and opportunity to do so. Meanwhile, higher-status medical middle managers may lack motivation to engage in knowledge brokering with peers outside their specialism. We suggest that inter- and intraprofessional power and status has important implications for HR practices to support knowledge brokering by hybrid middle managers. Should HR practices fail to support ability, motivation, and opportunity for knowledge brokering across and within professions, then a “broken” rather than “broker” chain may result. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Mitra, Atul
Author-Name: Tenhiälä, Aino
Author-Name: Shaw, Jason D.
Abstract: The authors extend prior literature by examining, in two distinct field settings, smallest meaningful pay increases (SMPIs) in terms of magnitude, behavioral intention, and affective reactions. In Study 1, a two-wave study of 177 employees of a university medical center in the United States, the authors find stable thresholds of about 5.0 percent for positive reactions to pay increases (magnitude [5.4 percent], behavioral intentions [4.2 percent], and affective reactions [5.6 percent]). In Study 2, a sample of 495 university employees in Finland, the authors also find stable but slightly higher thresholds of about 8 percent for behavioral intentions (8.4 percent) and positive affective reactions (7.2 percent) to pay increases. They also find threshold effects of −5.7 percent for behavioral intentions and −5.8 percent for negative affective reactions in response to restricted future pay increases levied in the transition to a new pay system. Discussion of the results centers on pay raise administration and future research regarding implied and direct pay reductions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Antecedents and Outcomes of Diversity and Equality Management Systems: An Integrated Institutional Agency and Strategic Human Resource Management Approach
Author-Name: Konrad, Alison M.
Author-Name: Yang, Yang
Author-Name: Maurer, Cara C.
Abstract: This study examines the development and impact of diversity and equality management systems (DEMS). A national sample of human resource managers from 155 Canadian firms responded to surveys about their firm's diversity and equality management (DEM) practices. Cluster analysis and latent class modeling identified three distinct approaches to DEM: classical disparity DEMS showing limited development of DEM-related practices, institutional DEMS involving complex selection mechanisms and monitoring of employment statistics, and configurational DEMS linking diversity to business strategy. Hypothesis-testing analyses indicated that both institutional and configurational DEMS were predicted by coverage by the Canadian employment equity program, federal contractor status, and the presence of a diversity expert on staff. Only configurational DEMS was predicted by inclusion of HRM in developing business strategy. Configurational DEMS positively predicted the employment of workers with disabilities and members of visible minority groups as well as ROA. These findings support the proposition based on strategic human resource management (SHRM) theory that DEM practices should be considered as bundles and that vertical linkage to strategy is important for DEM effectiveness. As such, SHRM theory explains how managers can structure strategic responses to institutional pressures that go beyond requirements to achieve strategic goals. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Varieties of Qualifications, Training, and Skills in Long‐Term Care: A German, Japanese, and UK Comparison
Author-Name: Gospel, Howard
Abstract: This article considers the systems of qualifications and training in the long-term elderly care sector in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Each country faces similar challenges of coping with increasing demand and securing staff for quality and cost-effective care. However, the three countries organize qualifications and training in very different ways. In the case of formal care workers, there is a hierarchy of training and skills, with Germany at the top, Japan in the middle, and the United Kingdom at the bottom. However, comparing the whole workforce, Germany has developed a dualistic structure with both highly and lowly trained workers; Japan has developed a relatively large proportion of moderately trained and qualified staff; and the UK workforce consists of a relatively large proportion of lowly trained and unqualified workers. Explanations are considered and implications offered for human resource management. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to analyze and highlight the developments in the current scholarship on managing diversity and inclusion (D&I) and provide insights for future research. While doing so, the article advances our understanding of “what matters” in this field, through the integration of different literature concerning the dimensions of D&I. It also provides a neo-institutionalist framework, which locates different themes in the D&I scholarship to assist in further development of the field. It argues for a consideration of inquiry in D&I from a neo-institutionalist perspective to encourage interdisciplinarity and align with broader social science research in human resource management (HRM) and development, highlighting the complexity involved in the theorizing of D&I management in organizations. Specifically, we argue for the need to engage with a variety of stakeholders concerned with the management of D&I, to enable cross-fertilization of theories and mixing methods for future research designs.

Author-Name: Zimmerman, Ryan D.
Abstract: Technology continues to play an ever-increasing role in both our work and private lives. In parallel with this expanding reliance on technology has been a shift in how people now view their jobs. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide a theoretical model that bridges these two areas—technology and employee attitudes (more specifically, work-related feelings of embeddedness). Within our model, we consider aspects of common work-related technologies and key perceptual variables related to technology, and how both areas can influence embeddedness in one's job. We conclude the article by providing examples of how specific technologies that are commonly found in today's work environment may influence job embeddedness perceptions, and we discuss the implications of the model on both theory and practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Pereira, Vijay
Author-Name: Fontinha, Rita
Abstract: This study provides an innovative perspective on empirically assessing HR by focusing on the duality of HR professionals’ experiences as both implementers and recipients or internal customers of HR practices given that they are also employees of the organization. We hypothesize that HR professionals experience HR practices more favorably from an implementer perspective as compared to an internal customer perspective. These differences in experiences are likely to be influenced by HR professionals’ hierarchical position in the HR department.

Title: HRM Signals for the Capital Market
Author-Name: Krausert, Achim
Abstract: This conceptual study contributes to an emerging literature at the intersection of strategic HRM and finance, which is concerned with the undervaluation of future-oriented HRM practices in the capital market and consequent disincentives for managers to invest in such HRM practices. More specifically, the study contributes to a search for signals of HRM investments that the capital market either attends to or should attend to. It focuses on potential signals of high-performance work systems (HPWSs), constituting an HRM investment that has been at the center of research in strategic HRM. Based on signaling theory, a model is proposed of relationships among three signal characteristics (signal fit, signal erosion, and signal diffusion) and sustainable signal correlation. The model provides a basis for the exploration of alternative strategies for the establishment of an HRM signal tailored specifically to the needs of the capital market. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Employees as Active Consumers of HRM: Linking Employees’ HRM Competences with Their Perceptions of HRM Service Value
Author-Name: Meijerink, Jeroen G.
Author-Name: Bondarouk, Tanya
Author-Name: Lepak, David P.
Abstract: Recognizing the importance for companies of having high-quality employment relationships with employees, previous studies have sought to explain the variability in employees’ perceptions of HRM service value. However, most of these studies view employees as inactive in employment relationships and, therefore, do not consider whether employees’ own attributes affect their perceptions of HRM service value. In accepting the alternative notion that consumers create value “in use,” the current study regards employees as active consumers of HRM practices, and so examines the extent and way in which employees’ HRM competences (i.e., knowledge, skills, and abilities) explain the variability in HRM service value. Based on data collected from 2,002 employees in 19 companies in the Netherlands, a positive relationship has been found between employees’ HRM competences and their perception of HRM service value, albeit one that is mediated by the perceived quality and nonmonetary costs of HRM services. The main implication of our findings is that employees should be seen as active agents in employment relationships who, through coproducing and consuming HRM services as well as leveraging their knowledge and skills, influence the value of HRM services and have the potential to increase or undermine the outcomes of the employment relationship. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Evolution of Strategic HRM as Seen Through Two Founding Books: A 30th Anniversary Perspective on Development of the Field
Author-Name: Kaufman, Bruce E.
Abstract: Two pioneering books published in 1984 arguably launched the field of strategic human resource management (SHRM). The first is Strategic Human Resource Management by Fombrun, Tichy, and Devanna; the second is Managing Human Assets by Beer, Spector, Lawrence, Mills, and Walton. This article provides a 30th anniversary review of the two books, partly to honor their pioneering contributions but also to use them as a lens for examining how the field has subsequently evolved and developed. Two recently published SHRM books are used as a benchmark for this analysis. The review identifies areas of SHRM constancy and change, major theoretical and empirical innovations, and newly developed research questions and directions, largely in an American context. Diagrammatic models of SHRM are synthesized and compared from the four books; also, nine specific dimensions of evolution in the field are highlighted with discussion of advances and shortcomings. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The results of research on mergers and acquisitions often point to a need to improve acquisition outcomes and lessen the organizational turmoil that can often follow integration efforts. We assert that viewing acquisition integration through the lens of contextual ambidexterity may improve acquisition outcomes in two ways: by providing an integrated solution to the economic and social tensions in acquisitions, and by enabling managers to effectively confront the competing needs of task and human integration. We also posit that by building on contextual ambidexterity, we can extend the possibilities for both research and practice regarding task and human integration in acquisitions. We also emphasize the role of an integration manager and integration mechanisms in enabling contextual ambidexterity for successful acquisition integration. Finally, we identify implications for research and practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: This study examines line managers’ rationales regarding reduced-load work (RLW), an emerging talent management practice allowing professionals to reduce their workload and take a pay cut, while actively remaining on a career path. Unlike flextime and telework, RLW addresses professionals’ core problems of rising work hours and workloads. Interviews with 42 managers in 20 North American employers suggested that managers were more likely to support RLW for employees whom they saw as (1) high-performers, (2) flexible in their use of RLW, and (3) doing conducive jobs. Interviews with 20 HR experts and 24 senior executives revealed four dimensions of organizational support, two cultural (senior management support and discourse on career penalties) and two structural (adaptation of HR systems and organizational diffusion). In embracing organizations there was a higher frequency of more supportive managers than there was in ambivalent organizations. Managers’ rationales were connected to their organizational contexts, albeit loosely, suggesting managerial implementation agency. The same rationales were more likely to be used in supportive ways in embracing contexts and in less supportive ways in ambivalent contexts. This study suggests that managerial and organizational support for flexible talent management practices dovetail in nuanced and important ways. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Previous research has established that relationships with authority figures and procedural justice perceptions are important in terms of the way in which employees react to organizational procedures that affect them. What is less clear are the reasons why exchange quality with authorities is related to perceptions of process fairness and the role of procedural justice climate in this process. Results indicate that individual-level perceptions of procedural justice, but not performance ratings, partially mediate the relationship between exchange quality and reactions to performance appraisals, and that procedural justice climate is positively related to perceptions of procedural justice and appraisal reactions. These results support a more relational than instrumental view of justice perceptions in organizational procedures bound by exchange quality with an authority figure. Our study suggests that it is essential for managers to actively monitor and manage employee perceptions of process fairness at the group and individual levels. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Wood, Geoffrey
Abstract: This article focuses on knowledge management in UK hospitals as an area in which organizational ambidexterity (OA) is a necessary condition. In contrast to much of the literature on OA that looks at senior managers, we focus on the role of “hybrid” middle managers, professional workers who hold managerial responsibilities, in ensuring that the quality of care delivered is at an optimum “safe” level for patients. We examine the influence of prevailing tensions and competing agendas characteristic of a professionalized, public-sector context upon knowledge exploitation and exploration at the middle levels of the organization. Our study investigates how these tensions are experienced and reconciled at the individual level. We examine the contextual and personal circumstances that enable hybrid middle managers to forge workable compromises between exploration and exploitation to facilitate OA. We find that this process is contingent on professional legitimacy, social capital, and a holistic professional orientation. This has wider implications for human resource practice to support the discretion and motivation of hybrid middle managers to facilitate OA for enduring performance and advancement of best practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Thirty years on from the seminal works on human resource management (HRM) by Beer et al., we examine how the subject has developed. We offer a normative review, based on that model and critique the assumption that the business of HRM is solely to improve returns to owners and shareholders. We identify the importance of a wider view of stakeholders to practitioners and how academic studies on the periphery of HRM are beginning to adopt such a view. We argue that the HRM studies so far have given us much valuable learning but that the subject has now reached a point where we need to take a wider, more contextual, more multilayered approach founded on the long-term needs of all relevant stakeholders. The original Beer et al. model remains a valuable guide to the next 30 years of HRM. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Social Capital Effects on the Career and Development Outcomes of HR Professionals
Author-Name: Gubbins, Claire
Author-Name: Garavan, Thomas
Abstract: HR professionals’ roles require them to be responsive to both employee needs and top management strategies. However, the need to respond to the often competing employee and strategic agendas makes relationship-building efforts challenging. This study examines the social capital characteristics of HR professionals and the impact on receipt of network benefits and career outcomes. Results indicate that HR professionals benefit from relationships with other HR professionals for career sponsorship and role-related benefits. However, it is contacts who are in higher positions or in other organizations that transfer the most influential benefits, which in turn relate to objective career outcomes. Few benefits are obtained from contacts in non-HR functions. The results illuminate relationship development opportunities for HR professionals. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: From Bipartite to Tripartite Devolved HRM in Professional Service Contexts: Evidence from Hospitals in Three Countries
Author-Name: McDermott, Aoife M.
Author-Name: Fitzgerald, Louise
Author-Name: Van Gestel, Nicolette M.
Author-Name: Keating, Mary A.
Abstract: This article explores the devolution of HRM in a hospital context. Based on secondary data and 128 interviews conducted in nine hospitals across three European countries (Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), we examine roles and responsibility for HRM under devolution and coordination between those delivering it. Findings challenge bipartite conceptions of devolution, identifying a tripartite model with (1) HR practitioners, (2) line managers, and (3) senior professionals (managers and specialists) implementing HRM. Involving senior professionals in HRM reflects long-standing concern regarding managerial legitimacy in overseeing professional work. In the tripartite relationship, each party has scope to contribute to people management: HR practitioners to formulate a strategic framework, HR practices, and provide advisory services; line managers to implement HR practices and interface between HR and frontline professionals; and senior professionals to act as line managers’ advocates and provide expert knowledge and credibility to inform people-related decision making. However, lack of role clarity and tensions in coordination relate to the differing goals of, and distance between, the HR function, line managers, and senior professionals. Our theoretical reframing of devolution notes potential for tripartite relational involvement to enhance HR performance in professional service contexts, the contingencies affecting this, and potential implications for the HR architecture. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Innovating Beyond the Horizon: CEO Career Horizon, Top Management Composition, and R&D Intensity
Author-Name: Heyden, Mariano L. M.

Author-Name: Van Doorn, Sebastiaan
Abstract: Decreasing research and development (R&D) can impair the ability of firms to remain innovative in the long run. CEOs have been accused of curtailing R&D investments as they approach expected retirement, yet received findings on R&D investment behaviors of late-career CEOs are mixed. We argue that one reason for these inconsistent findings could be that traditional approaches overlook the fact that CEOs are not isolated agents in making R&D decisions. We build on the premise that CEOs interact with their top management team (TMT) when shaping R&D strategy and advance a contextualized view of CEO dispositions in their late career stages as being constrained or enabled by their TMT. We hypothesize that some TMT attributes (e.g., tenure and age) may amplify, whereas others (e.g., functional experience and education) may mitigate inclinations to reduce R&D. Our findings, based on a longitudinal sample of 100 US manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2008, provide nuanced insights into how different TMT characteristics influence CEO-TMT dynamics, with TMT age and TMT tenure playing particularly pronounced roles. We discuss implications of our CEO-TMT interface approach for theory and practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Management Development Practices on Organizational Commitment
Author-Name: Cao, Jie
Author-Name: Hamori, Monika
Abstract: Social exchange theorists argue that organizations that provide developmental assignments raise employee commitment. But such assignments may also undermine commitment by increasing the recipients’ value in the external labor market. We compare the effect of developmental assignments on organizational commitment with that of other development practices: coaching, mentoring, training, and support from the direct superior and senior management. We also test whether synergies arise when developmental assignments are combined with the other development practices. Using a sample of 312 highly skilled professionals working in over sixty countries, in a variety of industries and firms of various sizes, we find that developmental assignments are the strongest driver of organizational commitment, together with support from senior management. The positive relationship between developmental assignments and organizational commitment is weaker in the presence of other development practices. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Keeping Their Cards Close to Their Chests: How Non‐Delegating CEOs Avoid Forced Career Ends
Author-Name: Oehmichen, Jana
Author-Name: Schult, Alexander
Author-Name: Wolff, Michael
Abstract: It is a common belief that CEOs must delegate to be successful. We hesitate to support this generalization and investigate how the distribution of responsibility within top management teams (TMTs) can influence the likelihood of a CEO’s dismissal. Consistent with an agency theory perspective, our results indicate that CEOs may choose not to delegate their responsibilities to other executive TMT members, so as to benefit from an increased information asymmetry vis-à-vis the board of directors. Taking the resource-based view as a complementary theoretical perspective, we find that non-delegating CEOs benefit from their greater firm-specific knowledge, which the board of directors considers as a valuable resource that should be retained. Our work also demonstrates that a more intense CEO–TMT interaction weakens the relation between non-delegation and the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In sum, our research shows that the CEO’s delegation decision does not necessarily lead to a competence distribution that is in the firm's best interest; rather, it reflects a complex interplay between the potentially opportunistic career interests of the CEO, the involvement of other TMT members and the board of directors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Do organizational controls facilitate or hinder employees’ trust in their organization? We addressed this question through a mixed-methods design using three studies. Based on a literature review and an open-response survey study (Study 1), we developed a theoretical model proposing that organizational control is positively related to employees’ trust in their organization, and that this relationship is mediated by procedural fairness and organizational prestige. This mediated model was tested and supported in a quantitative survey of 582 European managers and professional employees from a range of organizations (Study 2). A complementary, qualitative interview-based study (Study 3) confirmed that well-implemented controls facilitate trust in the organization; however, poorly implemented control systems that are inconsistent, overly rigid, or incentivize untrustworthy behavior can undermine trust in the organization. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: HRM at a Crossroads: Comments on “Evolution of Strategic HRM Through Two Founding Books: A 30th Anniversary Perspective on Development of the Field”
Author-Name: Beer, Michael
Abstract: I agree with Bruce Kaufman's evaluation of the HRM field and the danger to its relevance if change does not take place in the field's almost exclusive use of normal science, lack of focus on organizational change and development and indifference to the development of useful and usable knowledge. I use the development of the Harvard Business School's first-ever required course in HRM and Managing Human Assets, the book that grew from the course, to illustrate why and how the strategic HRM perspective of the book emerged. I go on to argue that we do not need more proof that HRM practices are associated with financial performance. The best CEOs already believe this, though they need knowledge and practices that will enable them to develop a positive sustainable HRM system. HRM research, both normal and action science, must answer the question of how a “great” HRM system—practices, leadership, organization design, culture, and change processes—might be developed over time (its takes years) and how great companies can avoid the liquidation of intangible assets in the face of pressures for short-term performance. I describe my own work to illustrate the future direction HRM should take methodologically and conceptually. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Strategic HRM: Too Important for an Insular Approach
Author-Name: Cascio, Wayne F.
Abstract: Strategic human resource management (SHRM) is the choice, alignment, and integration of an organization's HRM system so its human capital resources most effectively contribute to strategic business objectives. Kaufman's review (this issue) of four books in the field revealed key differences in two areas: the intended audience (academics and general managers versus researchers only) and orientation (the use of field observer and participant observation methods versus ivory tower scientism). Overemphasis on the latter produces research that is relevant only to academics and that is not used in organizations. I argue, as have others, that in addition to rigor, a successful scientific discipline must prove itself relevant to the society in which it is embedded. Hence, the objectives of SHRM should be twofold: to influence academic thinking and conceptualizing, but also to alter the way managers set priorities and make decisions. To do that, researchers have to work directly with managers. The challenge is to create models that reflect a broader view of performance as well as more complete taxonomies of internal and external factors that help shape business and HR strategies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Business Case for Gender Diversity: Examining the Role of Human Resource Management Investments
Author-Name: Roh, Hyuntak
Author-Name: Kim, Eugene
Abstract: Integrating opposing theoretical perspectives from the past literature, the authors hypothesize and test a U-shaped curvilinear relationship between gender diversity and workforce productivity. They further propose that the curvilinear effects vary depending on the levels of an organization's human resource management (HRM) investments in pay, benefit, training, and communication; that is, the patterns are more salient when HRM investments are high rather than low. To enhance understanding of how HRM investments have impact on diverse employees, the authors also examine the moderating influence of organizational identification of diverse members that can exert proximal influence on the diversity-productivity relationship. As predicted, results reveal that high levels of HRM investments influence the gender diversity–workforce productivity association to form a U-shaped curvilinear relationship. Organizational identification also yields the same moderating patterns. Research and practical implications are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Value of CEO Mobility: Contextual Factors That Shape the Impact of Prior CEO Experience on Market Performance and CEO Compensation
Author-Name: Bragaw, Nathan A.
Author-Name: Misangyi, Vilmos F.
Abstract: This study examines the value that prior CEO experience has for the companies that hire such CEOs—as reflected in the firms’ subsequent market-based performance—as well as its value for the CEO that possesses this experience—as reflected in his or her initial compensation. While we suggest that shareholders tend not to benefit from firms hiring experienced CEOs, we also argue that particular firm and industry contextual factors that shaped the prior CEO experience help ameliorate this detrimental effect. Regardless, we also suggest that prior CEO experience generally stands to benefit the CEOs, in that it brings them a compensation premium over those CEOs without such prior experience. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 654 US CEO succession events that occurred between 2001 and 2004 and found broad support for our hypotheses. We close with a discussion of the implications of our findings for future research as well as what they mean for firms hiring experienced CEOs and for CEO careers more generally. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Lin, Nan
Abstract: This article investigates how firms’ use of social capital criteria in staffing practices has been affected by China's transitional institutional environment and explores the impacts of person-job fit in the social capital dimension on employees’ performance. Empirical results show that non-state-owned enterprises set a higher social capital standard in the hiring process than state-owned enterprises. Foreign-invested enterprises outperform other firms in promoting a better match between individuals rich in social capital and the positions that need such resources. In places with intensive market competition, foreign and private enterprises pay even more attention to employees’ social capital when making HR decisions. Moreover, a better match between people and positions from a social capital aspect has a positive impact on employees’ performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: When Feedback Interventions Backfire: Why Higher Performance Feedback May Result in Lower Self‐Perceived Competence and Satisfaction with Performance
Author-Name: Luffarelli, Jonathan
Author-Name: Gonçalves, Dilney
Author-Name: Stamatogiannakis, Antonios
Abstract: In relative performance evaluation systems, appraisers may choose to adopt stricter or laxer evaluation criteria. When laxer (vs. stricter) criteria are used, higher absolute performance evaluations become easier (vs. harder) to achieve. Thus, each appraisee's absolute performance feedback and the mean of the distribution of absolute performance feedback are shifted upward (vs. downward). Yet, relative performance remains constant. When evaluation outcomes depend solely on relative performance, can the adoption of laxer (vs. stricter) criteria—leading to higher absolute performance feedback but no change in relative performance—influence appraisees’ satisfaction with performance? Despite the ubiquity of such systems in organizations, research has not addressed this question. This article points to an important gap between practitioners’ beliefs and research findings. We show that while most appraisers believe that higher absolute performance feedback will automatically result in more satisfaction with performance, the opposite may also happen. Specifically, we find that appraisees with a stronger (vs. weaker) chronic or contextual need to engage in social comparison are more satisfied with lower (vs. higher) absolute performance feedback. Overall, we demonstrate why and how feedback interventions in relative performance evaluation systems may backfire, and suggest a set of practical guidelines for maximizing appraisees’ satisfaction with performance in such systems. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Evaluating Form and Functionality of Pay‐for‐Performance Plans: The Relative Incentive and Sorting Effects of Merit Pay, Bonuses, and Long‐Term Incentives
Author-Name: Park, Sanghee
Author-Name: Sturman, Michael C.
Abstract: Using two-year longitudinal data from a large sample of US employees from a service-related organization, the present study investigates the relative effects of three forms of pay-for-performance (PFP) plans on employees’ job performance (incentive effects) and voluntary turnover (sorting effects). The study differentiates between three forms of pay: merit pay, individual-based bonuses, and long-term incentives. By definition, these PFP plans have different structural elements that distinguish them from each other (i.e., pay plan form) and different characteristics (functionality), such as the degree to which pay and performance are linked and the size of the rewards, which can vary both within and across plan types. Our results provide evidence that merit raises have larger incentive and sorting effects than bonuses and long-term incentives in multi-PFP plan environments where the three PFP plans are operating simultaneously. Only merit pay has both incentive and sorting effects among the three PFP plans. The implications for the PFP-related theory, as well as for the design and implementation of PFP plans, are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Organizational learning capability (OLC) and employee flexibility help firms navigate the challenges faced by organizations operating in turbulent environments. OLC includes dimensions such as experimentation, risk taking, openness, dialogue, and participative decision making. Employee flexibility is considered a crucial tool for strategic human resource management in tackling environmental turbulence. Accordingly, we pose the following research question: how, and to what extent, is individual performance enhanced by OLC and employee flexibility in turbulent environments? The major impact that environmental turbulence has on change and flexibility requirements suggests that employee flexibility plays an important role in the impact OLC has on individual performance. However, we found no prior studies that explicitly analyzed this mediating function of employee flexibility. In this study, we tested three hypotheses that link OLC and individual performance, OLC and employee flexibility, and employee flexibility and individual performance. We applied a structural equation methodology, using partial least squares path modeling, to a sample of 174 academics at a Latin American university (a highly turbulent context). Our results show employee flexibility fully mediates the relation between OLC and individual performance given the presence of environmental turbulence. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Guest Editors’ Introduction: Human Resource Management in Health Care and Elderly Care: Current Challenges and Toward a Research Agenda
Author-Name: Cooke, Fang Lee
Author-Name: Bartram, Timothy
Abstract: Given the universal pressures within the health and elderly care sectors for cost reduction and the need for high-quality care, the effective management of the workforce in care organizations is of critical importance. In this article, we examine the changing landscape of the health care and aged care systems and identify key challenges for the human resource management (HRM) field. We assess existing research evidence on the role of HRM and high-performance work systems in the health care sector. We also outline a number of research areas as fruitful avenues for future studies, drawing particular attention to aged care as an underresearched subsector, and immigrants as an important group of research targets. The key message of our article is that future research on HRM in the care sector has much to gain by adopting an interdisciplinary, multilevel, and multistakeholder approach. More cross-sectoral and cross-country comparative studies of HRM in health care and other care work are also needed to shed light on how policy orientations, institutional arrangements, social norms, and cultural traditions influence care regimes across different societies, and to encourage the sharing of learning across societies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Three experiments were conducted to test whether an enhanced degree of fair behavior could be obtained by making justice a goal, whether consciously set, primed, or both. Each experiment assessed fairness in a competitive negotiation context. All participants, across the three experiments, were asked to attain a base-level performance goal. The first experiment examined how a negotiation is affected by a consciously set goal for fairness as well as a primed fairness goal. The results revealed that both the conscious and the primed goal enhanced a participant's fairness. The second and third experiments examined the underlying mediating mechanisms of the effects found in the first experiment. Overall, the results of three experiments indicate that both conscious and primed goals, individually or in combination, can increase fair behavior by enhancing justice saliency. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Does the Presence of Voice Imply the Absence of Silence? The Necessity to Consider Employees’ Affective Attachment and Job Engagement
Author-Name: Knoll, Michael
Author-Name: Redman, Tom
Abstract: Employer-sponsored voice practices (ESVPs) are a tool used by human resource management to increase voice behavior and fulfill legal requirements for employee participation and consultation. Conceptual papers question the usefulness of ESVPs, arguing that they may promote selective expression at work in the way that employees who use ESVPs suggest work-related process improvements (i.e., promotive voice) but still remain silent about issues that disturb smooth cooperation (i.e., cooperative silence). Prior research that treated voice and silence as being mutually exclusive cannot clarify how using ESVPs relates to voice and silence and under which conditions these links are particularly strong. Drawing from an employee survey in a UK branch of a multinational technology company, we apply a differentiated approach that treats voice and silence as separate behaviors and considers their specific motivators. Results from structural equation modeling show that even though employees use ESVPs and engage in voice, silence may still linger as a potential threat to performance and well-being. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed that affective attachment to the organization increased and job engagement decreased the occurrence of this potentially dangerous coincidence. Our findings provide evidence for the usefulness of more differentiated approaches to employee voice and silence and indicate that factors that facilitate voice, be they formal procedures or pro-organizational attitudes, might not suffice to overcome silence at work. We close with a discussion on ways to facilitate voice while reducing silence at the same time. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Entitlement to Work‐Life Balance Support: Employee/Manager Perceptual Discrepancies and Their Effect on Outcomes
Author-Name: Stavrou, Eleni
Author-Name: Ierodiakonou, Christiana
Abstract: We broaden contemporary understandings of the relationship between HR practices that support work-life balance and organizational as well as individual outcomes, through a focus on perceptual discrepancies of entitlement. To theorize this notion, we adopt the self-perception accuracy model and extend it by investigating whether any employee/management discrepancies in perceptions of entitlement mediate the relationship between HR practices supporting work-life balance and outcomes. We use data from 20 European countries and apply a multilevel statistical methodology. Our results did not reveal significant mediation effects, but the perceptions of managers, not of employees, are related to HR practices that support work-life balance. Furthermore, employees tend to have higher expectations of entitlement than does management. Finally, the more aligned management and employee perceptions of entitlement, the higher the positive organizational and individual outcomes over and above contextual idiosyncrasies. Findings denote that, in achieving positive outcomes for employees and organizations, managing perceptions regarding organizational support for work-life balance is more important than actual support practices. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Impact of Personal Resources and Job Crafting Interventions on Work Engagement and Performance
Author-Name: Van Wingerden, Jessica

Author-Name: Bakker, Arnold B.
Abstract: This study examined the impact of organizational interventions on work engagement and performance. Based on the job demands–resources model, we hypothesized that a personal resources intervention and a job crafting intervention would have a positive impact on work engagement and performance. We used a quasi-experimental design with a control group. Primary school teachers participated in the study at two time points with six weeks between the measurements ( N = 102). The results showed that the personal resources intervention had a positive causal effect on work engagement. Additionally, the joint personal resources and job crafting intervention had a positive impact on self-ratings of job performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Way to the Top: Career Patterns of Fortune 100 CEOS
Author-Name: Koch, Michael

Author-Name: Monties, Vanessa
Abstract: How have the CEOs of Fortune 100 companies worked their way to the top position? Are there several paths to the top, or have most present-day CEOs moved up the ranks in a similar fashion? We examine the employment trajectories of all of the current Fortune 100 CEOs across their entire working careers to answer these questions. The analysis developed in this article is carried out in two steps. We first use sequence analysis to find the patterns that are characteristic of the career paths of these CEOs. We then apply clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of career paths that have led individuals to the uppermost management level. Our results show that the careers of the Fortune 100 CEOs have largely followed traditional career paths that are symbolized by steady progression toward more responsibility, little mobility between firms and industries, and a strong focus on general management functions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: The field of career studies is increasing in prominence and relevance for modern life in general and working life in particular. CEOs’ careers, especially, have received growing attention because their impact goes far beyond their personal sphere. Not surprisingly, this topic has been at the intersection of multiple literatures. In this introduction for the special issue on CEOs’ careers, we first review the different perspectives in studying CEOs’ careers, and then offer several directions to integrate those multiple perspectives. The articles in this special issue not only provide us with comprehensive new knowledge on CEOs’ careers, but also represent valuable examples of how to integrate different perspectives on this topic. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Task Conflict and Employee Creativity: The Critical Roles of Learning Orientation and Goal Congruence
Author-Name: De Clercq, Dirk

Author-Name: Belausteguigoitia, Imanol
Abstract: We add to human resource literature by investigating how the contribution of task conflict to employee creativity depends on employees’ learning orientation and their goal congruence with organizational peers. We postulate a positive relationship between task conflict and employee creativity and predict that this relationship is augmented by learning orientation but attenuated by goal congruence. We also argue that the mitigating effect of goal congruence is more salient among employees who exhibit a low learning orientation. Our results, captured from employees and their supervisors in a large, Mexican-based organization, confirm these hypotheses. The findings have important implications for human resource managers who seek to foster creativity among employees. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: High Job Performance Through Co‐Developing Performance Measures With Employees
Author-Name: Groen, Bianca A. C.

Author-Name: Wouters, Marc J. F.
Abstract: According to various studies, employee participation in the development of performance measures can increase job performance. This study focuses on how this job performance elevation occurs. We hypothesize that when employees have participated in the development of performance measures, they perceive these measures to be of higher quality, which in turn elevates their attitudes toward, perceived social norms for, and perceived control over performing well in their jobs. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the latter three factors are hypothesized to increase job performance. Survey data from 95 employees as well as 88 of their managers were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Employee participation in developing performance measures is found to be related to job performance, via perceived measurement quality and employees’ perceived control over performing well. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings, including the limitations of this study's design, and sketch a number of future research paths in this area. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Rating Expatriate Leader Effectiveness in Multisource Feedback Systems: Cultural Distance and Hierarchical Effects
Author-Name: Kossek, Ellen Ernst
Author-Name: Huang, Jason L.
Author-Name: Piszczek, Matthew M.

Author-Name: Ruderman, Marian
Abstract: A critical challenge for global firms is to implement assessment tools to develop expatriate leaders who can effectively manage role relationships across different directions (upward, laterally, downward) in cross-national contexts. Drawing on social categorization and relational demography theories and a data set of 360-degree ratings of expatriates from 36 countries, we use multilevel modeling to investigate relationships between cultural distance and ratings of leadership effectiveness in task and contextual performance by colleagues with different hierarchical vantage points (subordinates, supervisors, peers). Cultural distance refers to the overall degree of difference in key cultural values identified in the GLOBE study between an expatriate's and coworkers’ countries of origin. Unlike supervisors as a rating group, results show that peer and subordinate raters as a group may be more likely to have their ratings negatively influenced by cultural distance, an effect that may be exacerbated for peer ratings from countries higher in power distance and lower in humane orientation. This study contributes to the understanding of multisource feedback systems to assess expatriate leadership effectiveness by identifying likely group ratings tendencies linked to cultural distance and hierarchical perspectives. Organizations should develop strategies to mitigate possible effects of cultural distance on subordinate and peer ratings of expatriates. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Exploring the Role of Leadership in Enabling Contextual Ambidexterity
Author-Name: Havermans, Liselore A.
Author-Name: Den Hartog, Deanne N.
Author-Name: Keegan, Anne
Author-Name: Uhl‐Bien, Mary
Abstract: Sustainable success calls for contextually ambidextrous organizing. According to theory, this entails enabling simultaneous high levels of exploration and exploitation within a subsystem. The practices involved in enabling contextual ambidexterity form a major and relatively unexplored leadership challenge. Our main aim is to draw on a combination of ambidexterity and complexity theory insights to understand how contextual ambidexterity emerges in dynamic contexts. We contribute to the literature on the role of leadership in enabling contextual ambidexterity by exploring the daily practices leaders enact to stimulate exploration and exploitation as well as to shift dynamically between them to (re)gain contextual ambidexterity. We present the results of two qualitative studies exploring leadership in project-based organizations where the pressure for contextual ambidexterity is relevant. We show that in responding adaptively to environmental stimuli, leaders shift between practices to emphasize exploitation or exploration to (re)gain the needed high levels of both, and their enactments are bounded by the conditions of keeping exploration and exploitation simultaneously high. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding contextual ambidexterity as a dynamic accomplishment that emerges in everyday interactions, the role of leaders in enabling contextual ambidexterity, and the need for HR managers to support leaders in enacting this dynamic form of leadership. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Incentive Pay and Firm Performance: Moderating Roles of Procedural Justice Climate and Environmental Turbulence
Author-Name: Sung, Sun Young

Author-Name: Kang, Sung‐Choon
Abstract: In connection with the literature on strategic reward and agency theory, this study investigates the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes and firm performance. We identify employee outcomes, such as commitment and competence, as mediating processes that explain the effects of incentive pay on firm performance. We further propose procedural justice climate and environmental turbulence as boundary conditions that determine the strength of the effects of incentive pay on employee outcomes. The research model is tested using multisource data collected at three time points over a five-year period from 227 Korean companies. Our analysis confirmed that incentive pay enhanced employee commitment and competence, which, in turn, improved the operational and financial performances of firms. The effect of incentive pay on employee commitment was negative for firms with a low procedural justice climate, but positive for firms operated under a highly turbulent environment. By contrast, the effect of incentive pay on employee competence was positive only for firms operated under a stable environment. This study enriches the literature by presenting and validating plausible underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions under which strategic performance–contingent incentive pay affects firm performance. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Executive Pay Matters: Looking Beyond the CEO to Explore Implications of Pay Disparity on Non‐CEO Executive Turnover and Firm Performance

Author-Name: Golden, Peggy
Abstract: Using a longitudinal data set covering a span of 10 years, we investigate the impact of vertical and horizontal pay disparity on non-CEO executive turnover and subsequent firm performance. Hypothesizing differential responses to pay disparity depending on a non-CEO executive's responsibilities, we first categorize non-CEO executives based on their job demands and their role in the organization (e.g., oversight, divisional). We then explore how pay disparity influences the relationship between executive category and turnover, and how the level of pay disparity impacts the relationship between turnover and firm performance. We find that executive category significantly impacts the likelihood of turnover, and also influences firm performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Professional service firms (PSFs) play an important role in the knowledge-based economy. Their success is highly dependent on their people, the knowledge resources they possess, and how they use these resources. However, how to systematically manage human resources to attain high performance is not fully understood. This study addresses this issue by investigating the linkage mechanisms through which high-performance work systems (HPWS) influence the performance of PSFs. We integrate resource-based and dynamic capability theories in order to identify and investigate two intervening mechanisms that link HR practices to firm performance. The first mechanism is the intellectual capital resources comprising the human, social, and organizational capital that HPWS create. The second mechanism is the uses to which both HPWS and resources can be applied, operationalized as organizational ambidexterity, the simultaneous exploitation of existing knowledge and exploration of new knowledge. These mechanisms are hypothesized to link HPWS to firm performance in the form of a practices-resources-uses-performance linkage model. Results from a longitudinal study of 93 accounting firms support this linkage model. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Human Capital Factors Affecting Human Resource (HR) Managers' Commitment to HR and the Mediating Role of Perceived Organizational Value on HR
Author-Name: Oh, In‐Sue

Author-Name: Kim, Seongsu
Abstract: Human resource (HR) managers’ commitment to their occupation (HR) leads to the proper delivery and implementation of HR practices and, therefore, is deemed as a critical factor for the success of HR practices. Based on sociocognitive, human capital, and signaling theories, this study examines: (a) HR managers’ own and their chief HR officer's (CHRO) HR-specific human capital as antecedents of their commitment to HR, and (b) the mediating mechanism through which the CHRO’s HR-specific human capital positively influences HR managers’ commitment to HR. Based on 146 HR managers from 146 organizations in South Korea, the findings of the current study suggest that HR managers with higher levels of HR-specific human capital and those working with CHROs with higher levels of HR-specific human capital tend to have higher levels of commitment to HR. In addition, CHROs with higher levels of HR-specific human capital positively influence HR managers’ commitment to HR by signaling to them that HR and its function are valued and cared about by their organizations. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed along with study limitations and further research directions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Using mixed design analysis of variance, this paper examines the effect of body art on job applicant hireability ratings. It employs the literatures on the social psychologies of stigma and prejudice, as well as aesthetic labor, to frame the argument. The results indicate that photos of tattooed and pierced job applicants result in lower hireability ratings compared to the control faces. The negative effect of body art on employment chances is, however, reduced for job applicants seeking non-customer-facing roles. In customer-facing roles, the tattoo is associated with lower hireability ratings than the piercing. The results suggest that visible body art can potentially be a real impediment to employment. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Lepak, David P.
Abstract: Strategic HRM researchers have increasingly adopted an employee perspective to understand the influence of HR practices on employee outcomes and have called for studies to explain variability in employees’ perceptions of HR practices. To address this research need, we used the social information processing perspective to examine the contextual influence of managers and coworkers on employees’ perceptions of HR practices and explore demographic dissimilarities as boundary conditions of the contextual influence. Conducting research in two organizational settings, we found that both manager-perceived and coworker-perceived HR practices were positively related to employees’ perceptions of HR practices. The results also revealed that employee demographic dissimilarity to coworkers in terms of age and organizational tenure weakened the positive relationship between coworker-perceived and employee-perceived HR practices. However, the relationship between manager-perceived and employee-perceived HR practices was not influenced by demographic dissimilarities. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: Ambidexterity is a growing field of management research. However, the role of human resources (HR) and organizational factors needs further exploration because of the fragmented nature of prior work and the subsequent lack of a unifying framework. Our review of 41 empirical studies identifies distinct research streams that relate to the effects of employee characteristics, leader characteristics, organizational structure, culture, social relationships, and organizational environment on ambidexterity. We discuss the most important findings within each stream, which contributes to the HR and ambidexterity literature by addressing the current state of our knowledge. To move forward research in this area, we identify important, yet underexplored areas in each stream. This contributes to the literature by highlighting specific gaps in our current knowledge that represent new avenues for future research. We also identify important interrelationships between different streams that need further clarification. We summarize our findings into an integrative model that elucidates the role of HR and organizational factors in ambidexterity. This contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of ambidexterity from the HR and organizational perspectives. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract: “Worthless,” “money burning,” or “black holes” is how media and professionals describe compliance practices today. Practitioners are unenthusiastic about control systems, codes of conducts, and systems for compliance management that are increasing in volume but not in effectiveness. In order to help practitioners clarify what actually makes employees comply with their compliance program, this study examines intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of 119 employees from procurement and sales. We contribute to the existing motivation literature, testing the self-determination theory in low and high hierarchical levels. Our findings show that intrinsic motivators are more strongly and positively related to compliance intention on higher hierarchical levels than the lower ones. However, employees from higher hierarchies show overall less compliance intention than employees from lower hierarchies. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: The Effects of Union and Nonunion Forms of Employee Representation on High‐Performance Work Systems: New Evidence from French Microdata
Author-Name: Laroche, Patrice
Author-Name: Salesina, Marc
Abstract: This article investigates the effects of union and nonunion employee representation (ER) on the use of high-performance work systems (HPWSs) in the French context. We use microdata from a nationally representative survey (REPONSE 2010–11) and estimate models dealing with the potential endogeneity of ER. After controlling for endogeneity and for a range of workplace characteristics, regression analyses suggest that neither union nor nonunion representatives are inherently against the use of HPWSs. Moreover, these forms of ER cannot be regarded as substitutes for one another. Results vary, depending on what type of bundle of practices is considered. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Author-Name: Jin, Jiafei
Abstract: Despite a plethora of studies that demonstrate the positive impact of strategic human resource management on firm performance, existing knowledge of the processes through which such gains can be achieved remains limited. This study aims to extend our knowledge by investigating the mechanism through which a teamwork-oriented executive strategic human resource management system impacts organizational ambidexterity. Specifically, by integrating the resource-based view and information-processing theory, we examine the mediating role of top management team effectiveness and the moderating role of knowledge–sharing intensity from middle managers to top management teams. Drawing on a multiple-source and multiple-respondent survey from 144 manufacturing firms in China, we show that top management team effectiveness partially mediates the effect of the executive strategic human resource management system on organizational ambidexterity. Moreover, knowledge-sharing intensity from middle managers to top management teams strengthens the effect of the executive strategic human resource management system on organizational ambidexterity. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: Who calls it psychologically devastating?
Author-Name: Sexton, William P.
Abstract: There is much headshaking over the welfare of workers who are subjected to rigid conditions in industrial work. Renowned theorists have concluded that an individual's ability to satisfy his personal psychological needs is seriously hampered by the resirictive demands of modern organization and control techniques. Is this actually the case or only an interesting theory? Here is evidence that managers are not crippling their workers by requiring conformity to work rules and procedures.

Title: In search of an administrator
Author-Name: Johnson, Gary
Abstract: When you go in search of an administrator, set your aims as high as possible, but remember that what constitutes a good administrator in another organization may not be exactly the person who fits best into your organization—analyze your own needs as closely as your candidates' administrative qualities, and determine the mix of these characteristics that will work best for you: intelligence, imagination, technical knowledge, verbal skill, humor, adaptability, ambition, aggressiveness, and discipline.

Author-Name: Sims, Henry P.
Abstract: T-Group training tends to be more effective in certain organizations facing dynamic environments than in other organizations facing stable environments; contingency theory, whose chief spokesmen are Paul Lawrence and Jay Lorsch, helps to explain why training has met with varying degrees of success.

Author-Name: Schuster, Jay R.
Author-Name: Munson, John B.
Abstract: To make a pay system a source of reinforcement for contribution and give people an opportunity to participate in a reward program each year without the stigma of becoming “too expensive,” firms might consider making less than 100% of the total amount increase distributed to an individual a permanent part of his base salary. A part of the raise could be in effect for, say, a year.

Author-Name: Auerbach, Arnold J.
Abstract: The public sector is in the same situation that labor-management relations was in during the middle thirties—but one big difference is this: in the 30s, the government pressured business leaders to choose the road to accommodation; in the 70's, it is pressuring public administrators to exert more force and authority to keep students, minorities, welfare clients and other groups out of the decision-making orbit.

Abstract: Except for the slave-owning areas of the south, no country has been as work-oriented as the United States. The American of all classes was expected to be “good with his hands.” But we shouldn't forget that work subcultures have their own mystique, they aren't “natural,” and one becomes a participating member through a process of enculturation which may be as difficult as the process of becoming Americanized is difficult for some immigrants.

Title: The co‐worldly executive
Author-Name: Jennings, Eugene Emerson
Abstract: The traditional American executive lived in the world of the company; the world of his family life was expected to reflect company priorities. But men are less willing now to pay high personal costs for corporate success, or to limit their private lives (or even their career potentials) to the demands of a single company. This new ethic of co-worldliness will require companies to learn to deal with new kinds of values and loyalties.

Title: The professional manager of the future
Author-Name: Crotty, Philip T.
Abstract: It's just possible that a businessman's role in the year 2000 will erode seriously due to little involvement in the growing “leisure values” of an affluent culture and failure to contribute directly to the needs of what will be a strongly post-industrial society. But if we want to train managers who are able to meet the needs and interests of the wider community, how do we prepare them for something as conceptual as “social responsibility”? Is it enough to superimpose on the business curriculum some courses in the social, political or technical-environmental forces affecting the individual and his firm, i.e. make the student study more and longer before he becomes an operative “professional”?

The discipline this paper offers toward recognizing your leadership profile is the important first step to intelligent career-planning.

If he lacks that, any job can seem dissatisfying and “menial.” Executives may suffer from this (or related behaviors) as much as assembly-line workers.

Abstract: To develop the institutions and social processes through which many can attain the self-actualization that only a few have up to now been able to seize, must be regarded as enormously difficult under the necessary constraint that we continue the adequate production of steel and houses and potatoes. Any moral evaluation of an organization in terms of its contribution to personal self-actualization becomes footless if the only means of increasing that contribution involves an increase in hunger or a decrease in personal security, for these are preconditions to self-actualization.

Title: A unique assessment center application with some unexpected by‐products
Author-Name: Jaffee, Cabot L.
Author-Name: Thoresen, Joseph D.
Abstract: A small, highly automated chemical plant needed blue collar workers for seven-man teams in an ‘enriched’ work environment: no foreman, 100% job rotation, and a rotating lead-man position. A mini-assessment center helped to identify the candidates to meet such unusual blue-collar requirements.

Title: Psychosomatic aspects of modern organizations
Author-Name: Rogers, Rolf E.
Abstract: Work conditions that are tense or threatening can affect the health of workers—both those in authority or non-authority positions. Managers cannot be psychiatrists to treat illness cause this way, or course, but they should be front-line diagnosticians, identifying basic behavior change that is detrimental to the individual and the firm which hires him.

Title: Structuring the organization for fast decision‐making
Author-Name: Ford, Charles H.
Abstract: As the No. 1 organizational problem, slow decision-making affects every large and medium-sized company. This, not size, makes these companies ponderous and cumbersome. After examining why slow decision-making occurs, the author details a new decision-making process designed not only to speed up decision-making, but to give management, for the first time, control over its corporate tempo.

While a ‘constitution’ to protect the rights of these people may seem problematical in terms of what it should cover, and who would administer it, it may be the least troublesome of all the possible alternatives now facing us.

Title: Paying people doesn't always work the way you expect it to
Author-Name: Deci, Edward L.
Abstract: In systems where rewards for fine performance are Money, Promotions, and Fringe Benefits, internal rewards which people derive from doing what they like (meeting a challenge, maybe) die out. That feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is quickly replaced as workers become less willing to perform in the absence of the external reward.

Even the concept of overtime may need to be rethought—what about the “normal working hours” of managers and professionals who work hours at home or on the road—hours typically uncompensated?

Title: Creating Japan's new industrial management: The Americans as teachers
Author-Name: Hopper, Kenneth
Abstract: Thirteen years ago, I first heard mention of three American engineers who had helped Japanese industry in important ways during the Occupation. In the midst of my other activities, I was able to track them down; it seemed to me that they could have valuable information on how Japan's “new” industrial management was shaped — a process about which very little has been written, at least in English. Such information I thought should surely help any of us who are interested in reshaping our own management in any way in the Japanese direction. I was not disappointed in what I found. In the following I have given comparatively little space to my own conclusions, and as much as possible to the material I have unearthed, in the belief that there are many able managers who would like to study the evidence themselves, and form their own conclusions about the significance of these past events for the present. In drawing attention to the hard work and dedication of those discussed in this article, I have wanted to pay tribute to the gift mid-century Americans made to the world — a gift of their sacrifice, generosity, and vision.

Title: Productive behavior through the life course: An essay on the quality of life
Author-Name: Kahn, Robert L.
Abstract: Present patterns of productive activity are neither well recognized, optimal for society, nor in accordance with individual prefence. Although a great deal of attention has been given to meeting people's needs for income, medical care, and other services, the quality of their lives must also be defined by what they do for themselves and for others. In discovering present patterns of productive activity throughout the life course and optimizing those patterns, we will raise the quality of American life. To accomplish this task, two great changes are needed: we must recognize the full range of productive activities throughout the life course and give people the opportunity to modify the allocation of paid employment.

Title: Gainsharing: A few questions, and fewer answers
Author-Name: Bullock, R. J.
Author-Name: Lawler, Edward E.
Abstract: Gainsharing is an important organization development intervention, yet many of the basic questions have not been answered. This paper addresses these questions by developing a conceptual model and using the model to review the case study literature on gainsharing. The plans varied in terms of structural factors, implementation factors, and situational factors, and a majority were successful. Gainsharing impact was found in five key areas: organizational effectiveness, individual quality of work life, ideas and innovation, labormanagement cooperation, and pay. Relevant research is briefly reviewed and several unanswered questions are identified for future research.

Abstract: This article shows how informally told stories and human resource systems help create strong company cultures which can support a corporate strategy. It explains why stories are so powerful in creating company culture. It also suggests how managers can deal with negative stories and encourage the telling of positive stories both through their personal behavior and through the human resource systems they manage.

Title: Key human resource strategies in an organization downturn
Author-Name: Perry, Lee Tom
Author-Name: Perry, Lee Tom
Abstract: Increasingly often, executives are being called upon to manage organizations through downturns. Of critical importance to the long-term health of a firm is how its employees are treated during these stressful periods. Human resource strategies must minimize the loss of key personnel needed for organizational survival and turnaround. The purpose of this article is to discuss why key employees leave organizations following a downturn. We propose two reasons: Either employees abandon a sinking ship or upon considering a lack of career opportunities, they take well-timed exits. Then, by considering individual career issues that arise from an organization downturn, ways to counteract ill-timed employee exit are identified. These human resource strategies either reduce organizational uncertainty or increase career opportunity.

Author-Name: Ulrich, Dave

Author-Name: DeSouza, Glenn
Abstract: Traditionally, strategic planners and human resource professionals have taken separate approaches in their attempts to improve organization functioning. As a result, strategic planners lack important information that affects the implementation of their plans and human resource managers have little impact on the strategic direction of their orgnizations. The University of Michigan, Hay Associates, and The Strategic Planning Institute have come together in a new venture to build a multicompany database that links organization characteristics and human resource and strategic planning practices with data on company financial performance. The database will be used to make intercompany comparisons on significant organization variables and to identify those practices that lead to improved financial performance.

Title: HRM and culture: History, ritual, and myth
Author-Name: Ulrich, Wendy L.
Abstract: The concept of organizational culture is here applied to the practice of human resource management. Reasons for the current emphasis on culture as an organizational metaphor are suggested. Cultural indicators which have diagnostic value for human resource professionals include organizational usage of symbols, rituals, ideologies, language, stories, myths, relationship, and humor. Examples of these indicators of culture are drawn from a variety of HRM practices and functions to explore the implications of each indicator. Alternative strategies are presented for improving the management of organizational change through sensitivity to cultural impact and better utilization of existing cultural realities.

Title: Strategic management of human resources in the multinational enterprise
Author-Name: Tung, Rosalie L.
Abstract: The efficient operation of a multinational enterprise is contingent upon the availability and effective utilization of numerous strategic resources—technology, capital, know-how, and people. It is my contention that human power is a key ingredient to the successful operation of a multinational, without which all the other aforementioned resources could not be effectively and efficiently utilized or transferred from corporate headquarters to the various subsidiaries in the world; hence the need for multinationals to devote greater attention to the strategic management of human resources as part of the overall planning and control process in a firm. This article identifies the most common pitfalls to human resource planning in U.S. multinationals and offers guidelines for the development of a paradigm for the strategic management of human resources in the multinational enterprise.

Title: Cooperation and change in union settings: Problems and opportunities
Author-Name: Schuster, Michael
Abstract: This article examines the increased levels of change and cooperation that have recently occurred in union settings. The article reports the results of interview data from 33 union/management relationships studied over a four- to seven-year period. The types of change programs discussed include productivity sharing plans, (for example, Scanlon, Rucker, and Improshare plans), area and in-plant labor/management committees, quality circles, and quality of work life projects. The focus of the article is on the problems of implementing cooperative strategies. These occur at three stages in the process: (1) establishing the cooperative framework; (2) establishing the boundaries between the cooperative and adversary processes; (3) factors interfering with continuing commitment. The author concludes with a discussion of the implications for government, management, and unions.

Title: High tech, basic industry, and the future of the american economy
Author-Name: Etzioni, Amitai
Author-Name: Jargowsky, Paul
Abstract: A growing number of economists, public policy analysts, and government officials have heralded a transformation said to be occurring in the American economy. The American-in-transformation thesis holds that new high-tech information-oriented industries are replacing basic industries as the primary source of America's economic stability and growth. This thesis, the authors point out, overstates the extent of the changes which are taking place. According to the best available projections, basic industries will continue to be an important sector of the American economy. Further, basic industries will serve as markets for high-tech products and services as they modernize their operations. Both sectors of the economy will be needed to sustain an integrated, two-track economy.

Title: Gaining competitive advantage through human resource management practices
Author-Name: Schuler, Randall S.
Author-Name: MacMillan, Ian C.
Abstract: Critical to a corporation's growth and prosperity is gaining and retaining competitive advantage. Although corporations may pursue many paths to this end, one that is frequently not recognized is capitalizing on superior human resource management. Currently, many companies recognize the growing importance of their human resources, but few are conceptualizing them in strategic terms—in ways to gain a competitive advantage. As a result, many companies forego the opportunity to seize competitive advantage through human resource practice initiatives. However, there are a few companies that do not forego the opportunity. We use them as examples to show how to systematically develop such advantages via a “target/thrust matrix.” The end results of this matrix have significant implications for both corporate strategy and personnel and human resource management.

Title: Revitalization: The most difficult of all strategies
Author-Name: Miller, James R.
Abstract: American industry following World War II has enjoyed much success, primarily built on growth and easily consumed material and human resources. Since 1973, however, resources have become increasingly critical and problems increasingly complex. Organizations large and small are faced with dramatic change. Strategies for growth and decline are clearly understood. A little-noted strategy, yet the most difficult of all strategies to implement, is that of revitalization. This article emphasizes the use of technology, middle managers, and interdisciplinary organization analysis as the necessary ingredients for American revitalization strategy success in the 1990s.

Title: On the importance of a generalist conception of human resource management: A cross‐national look
Author-Name: Evans, Paul A. L.
Abstract: What is human resource management? The term risks becoming devalued if it is associated with particular approaches to the management of people, to labor relations, or to the development of the personnel function. These aspects of HRM have to be seen in context—indeed, HRM is best viewed as the management of organizational context, as “governance.” This is the challenge for general management, supported by personnel generalists.

Title: Strategies for adapting to high rates of employee turnover
Author-Name: Mowday, Richard T.
Abstract: For many organizations facing high rates of employee turnover, strategies for increasing employee retention may not be practical because employees leave for reasons beyond the control of management or the costs of reducing turnover exceed the benefits to be derived. In this situation managers need to consider strategies that can minimize or buffer the organization from the negative consequences that often follow from turnover. Strategies organizations can use to adapt to uncontrollably high employee turnover rates are presented in this article. In addition, suggestions are made for how managers should make choices among the alternative strategies.

Title: Human resource management strategies in declining industries
Author-Name: Ferris, Gerald R.
Author-Name: Schellenberg, Deborah A.
Author-Name: Zammuto, Raymond F.
Abstract: The conceptualization presented in this article suggests that top management should take into account the role of the human resource function in formulating and implementing strategic responses to decline. Such responses must be formulated within the context of the skills and knowledge available to the organization and according to the type of environmental conditions encountered. These influences will force the human resource manager to focus on sharpening competencies existing within the organization, consolidating competencies so that only those currently required by the organization are retained, adding new competencies, or replacing existing competencies so that the organization can move to a new domain activity. The emphasis on human resource processes such as recruitment and termination, training and development, and evaluation, reward, and retention for purposes of development and maintenance of the competencies needed to implement strategic responses to decline will vary according to the nature of the environmental conditions encountered.

Title: Executive stress: A ten‐country comparison
Author-Name: Cooper, Cary L.
Abstract: In recent years, many companies have become conscious of the dire effects of excessive managerial stress on the performance of the organization, as well as on the health of their executives. Moreover, the so called “boss's disease” was long considered strictly a phenomenon of the affluent, industrialized Western world. The results of this investigation, however, reveal that the spectre of executive stress is not only taking on critical dimensions for companies in developing countries (in terms of mental well being and job satisfaction) but that its incidence is worrying, especially in newly industrialized Japan. The pressures on managers to perform in a climate of rapid sociological, technological, and economic change in emerging countries such as Brazil, Nigeria, Egypt, and Singapore, as well as Japan, are beginning to produce negative effects. Executives in all five countries show a higher incidence of mental stress symptoms and job dissatisfaction than their counterparts from other highly industrialized countries surveyed, e.g., the United States, Sweden, and West Germany.

Title: Organization and human resource professionals in transition
Author-Name: Sears, L. N.
Abstract: A critical issue confronting business management in the 1980s is how to successfully manage organizations and human resource issues at a time of rapid changes in markets, products, technology, and competition. These issues are aggravated by changing social values, government legislation, and international economics which impact on human resource managers even more. This article argues for a new type of professional, one who combines expertise in aligning the organization structure and culture with human resource systems and business strategy. The organization and human resource professionals (O&HR) role described is not totally new but a logical next generation extension of a role currently found at General Electric.

Title: Autonomy in the industrial R&D lab
Author-Name: Bailyn, Lotte
Abstract: This article distinguishes between “strategic autonomy” (the freedom to set one's own research agenda) and “operational autonomy” (the freedom, once a problem has been set, to attack it by means determined by oneself, within given resource constraints). The article argues, and presents some preliminary corroborating data, that technical careers in the R&D lab should start lower on strategic than on operational autonomy, that operational autonomy should show initial fairly rapid increase, which should be followed by increases in strategic autonomy, and that thereafter a number of different career paths should be available for technical employees. Most labs, however, seem to espouse a philosophy of strategic autonomy combined with operational controls, which creates dilemmas and contradictions in the technical career, particularly at its start. It is proposed that these two aspects of autonomy can usefully be thought of as a two-dimensional grid. Different positions on this grid seem to fit with different orientations and different tasks, and require different strategies for career management. The article ends with a discussion of these management implications.

Title: The basis for the professional's resistance to managerial control

Abstract: Observing that organizational professionals view themselves as employees of special status, resulting among other things in their demand for autonomy, Raelin digs down into the basis for their difficulty integrating into organizations. After examining the peculiarities of their education and early socialization experiences, he relates five features of professional life which, based on his ongoing research and consulting work, predispose professionals to resist managerial control.

Author-Name: Collins‐Eaglin, Jan
Abstract: This article reports on a study of technical professionals and technical managers in research and development laboratories. The basic premise which derives from John Holland's theory of vocational choice is that stable personality characteristics are associated with the different groups, and that these stable differences create an adaptive differentiation between the two groups. It is further suggested that this system of differentiated persons and occupational roles results in a partial key to the dilemma of autonomy versus control in organizations.

Abstract: A typology of the design of organizational reward systems that explicitly addresses attraction, evaluation, and retention of valued professionals is offered within four cultural contexts: the Apathetic Culture, the Caring Culture, the Exacting Culture, and the Integrative Culture. The strategic design of reward systems is one of the most critical but least understood phenomena in corporate America today. The special case of the autonomy-seeking professional is discussed and implications for strategic reward system change efforts are made.

Title: The concept of professionalism and the management of salaried technical professionals: A cross‐national perspective
Author-Name: Gerpott, Torsten J.
Author-Name: Domsch, Michel
Abstract: Based on a conceptual cross-national framework, the authors demonstrate how differences in a nation's prevailing beliefs about professionalism can affect national practices in managing technology and technical professionals. In the United States, the notion of professionalism has led in some cases to vertical polarization within the firm, a lack of adequate technical training among managers, an overuse of operational control of professionals, an over-emphasis on breakthrough technology, and a de-emphasis on practical production technologies. The authors conclude that a balanced view of professionalism can enhance a nation's competitive position.

Title: Professional/management relations: Imagery vs. action
Author-Name: Hall, Richard H.
Abstract: Managers and professionals have images about what professionalism involves. These images are used in personnel decisions and in other evaluation situations. The images used by professionals have multiple dimensions, many of which do not correspond to conventional stereotypes. The variable of power is of critical importance in developing and maintaining professional images. If management seeks to enhance the image of its personnel who are labeled professionals, it runs some risk of losing control of these personnel. The imagery of professionalization is viewed as developing more fully after individuals leave their professional training.

Title: The historical roots of the democratic challenge to authoritarian management
Author-Name: Gomberg, William
Abstract: Democracy is among the most misused words in our vocabulary and one of the most evanescent and slippery operational concepts. Sadly, although it should not come as a surprise, theory and reality often fail to mesh. This article provides an historical perspective on the participative management movement, based on the works of such theorists as Trist, Chandler, Taylor, and Fayol among others. It takes a critical look at the real problem facing managers today: How do we accommodate efficiency with democracy in a world where economic giants are subverting historical political sovereignties?

Title: Project work as an antidote to career plateauing in a declining engineering organization
Author-Name: Hall, Douglas T.
Abstract: This is a study of the effects of becoming plateaued on the careers of professionals in a declining organization. An unusual “triple ladder” was studied, one with paths in administration and technical specialization (the two typical components of a dual ladder system), as well as project management (a general practice, technical generalist role). In contrast to earlier studies of plateauing, it was found that occupational characteristics mitigate the effects of plateauing. The plateaued technical specialists experienced the expected declines in job attitudes; however, in project management, and to a lesser extent in administration, it was the plateaued group whose career outlook was most positive. Interview data suggested that the critical factor operating here was not plateauing per se, but the extent to which learning is required and experience and acquired skills are utilized and recognized in the work role. Structural career opportunities, intrinsic job rewards, and recognition were all critical factors in mitigating the effects of the career plateau.

Abstract: Is the recent popular management literature on corporate culture and cultural values just a passing fad or is it highlighting some fundamental organizational realities? The results from a recent nationwide survey of American managers shows, we are convinced, that clearly articulated organizational values do make a significant difference in the lives of employees, as well as in their organization's performance. This article is an effort to integrate this broad-based data on individual managers' values with the reported experience of successful organizations that pay careful attention to their culture. It also offers ideas on how human resource managers can facilitate the alignment of personal and organizational values.

Title: Professional autonomy as a basis of conflict in an organization
Author-Name: Marcus, Alfred A.
Abstract: Needed cutbacks in government and industry can lead to a situation where professionals have to operate where their autonomy is limited. How do they cope? Responses may include: “dubious” practice, the development and use of “simplified decision-rules,” “whistle-blowing,” reformism, and retreatism. Management can institutionalize a code-of-action that draws on the positive responses of the reformers and “decision simplifiers” and in this way better accommodate the need for both efficiency and professional integrity.

Title: Human resource management in action. The paradox of participation: Lessons from the tennessee valley authority
Author-Name: Nurick, Aaron J.
Abstract: The three year Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) quality of work life experiment was one of eight large scale projects developed by the American Center for Quality of Work Life and assessed by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. The key themes of this research program involved union–management collaboration and employee participation in organizational change. This article presents major outcomes of the experiment, with particular emphasis on the participatory change process that was the central focus at TVA. The implications of participation are discussed in terms of the paradoxes of change, leadership, and process. Based on data from interviews and observation of events throughout the experiment, recommendations are provided for similar quality of work life programs.

Title: Formulating and implementing human resource strategy: A model of how to do it, two examples of how it's done
Author-Name: Mirvis, Philip H.
Abstract: Business strategy is based upon a knowledge of markets and needs, an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of an organization, and an awareness of the political, social, and cultural factors that shape strategy implementation.  As managers adopt a strategic perspective toward human resources, they need to be sensitive to their labor market and employee's attitudes and needs, to the profile of jobs in their companies and jobholder's training and skills, and to key factors that will affect strategic management in their own firms. This paper identifies the factors companies need to consider when formulating human resource strategy and describes the implementation and monitoring of such strategies in two U. S. corporations: Caterpillar and Graphic Controls.

Title: The design and use of effective employee participation groups: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Mohrman, Susan Albers
Author-Name: Ledford, Gerald E.
Abstract: The use of employee participation groups is an increasingly widespread response to unrelenting environmental demands for higher levels of organizational performance. Guidelines for the design of participation groups are suggested, based on a study of participation group programs in nine organizational units of a major corporation. In order to be most effective, participation groups should include or have access to adequate skills and knowledge for systematic problem solving, should use formalized procedures, should be integrated horizontally and vertically with the rest of the organization, and should be a regular part of the organization rather than special entities. The appropriateness of using participation groups as a part of a larger human resource strategy is explored.

Title: Succession systems in large corporations: Characteristics and correlates of performance
Author-Name: Friedman, Stewart D.
Abstract: In this article succession systems in large corporations are characterized in terms of seven dimensions: formalization, control systems, resource allocation, information systems, political criteria, technical criteria, and staff role. Descriptive data drawn from a survey of key informants in 235 firms are presented. Hypothesized relationships between succession system characteristics and organization-level performance measures (corporate reputation and financial performance), given the effects of contextual conditions, are tested. Results reveal that high and low performing firms differ with respect to how they manifest succession systems. Six implications for how succession systems should be managed are proposed.

Title: Matching managers to strategies: Point and counterpoint
Author-Name: Gupta, Anil K.
Abstract: In recent years, an emerging and increasingly popular theme in the strategic management literature has been that the selection of general managers should be tied directly to the strategies of business units they will oversee. Because different strategies imply different priorities and the need for different skills, such a proposition has obvious intuitive appeal. Beyond intuitive appeal and supporting conceptual arguments, recent empirical research on whether matching general managers to strategies “pays off” in terms of more effective strategy implementation has also yielded positive results. Despite this evidence, several arguments exist for why it may not always be feasible, necessary, or desirable to match general managers to strategies. Thus, there is need for a point-counterpoint “debate” on the subject of matching general managers to strategies. Based on a review of the relvant literature, logical reasoning, as well as some case evidence, this paper is intended to be such a debate undertaken by the author with himself. It is hoped that such a dialectical analysis will open up new avenues for productive research and also enable corporate executives to make better “managerial selection” decisions.

Title: Dilemmas in linking succession planning to individual executive learning
Author-Name: Hall, Douglas T.
Abstract: This paper examines the issue of linking the selection of top-level executives with the development of these people. It first describes three stages in an organization's development of a succession system which promotes the attainment of a firm's objectives: 1) oneposition staffing, 2) replacement planning, and 3) succession planning. Then we examine the other piece to be connected to succession planning: executive learning. It is argued that most planned executive development is aimed at task learning, not personal learning. Consistent with this condition, most executive education activities overstress classroomstyle receptive methods, while neglecting active learning. Reasons for this state of affairs are proposed. The paper concludes with recommendations for enhancing personal learning for executives and for better integrating this learning with the strategic succession planning of the organization. This sort of strategic approach to executive succession is seen as the “acid test” in a firm's strategic planning process.

Author-Name: Bowman, Edward H.
Abstract: Interviews with 26 CEOs across a wide variety of industries reveals their concerns as well as agenda and behavior. The issues discussed have been placed against four intellectual frameworks to get a better picture of CEO concerns. These executives frequently ponder institutional and corporate strategy but very seldom business strategy and competitive markets. The plurality of the concerns deal with issues of management development and human resource management. Where the question is one of changing or redirecting the strategy of the firm, it is often put in the context of looking inside the firm at top managers and organization culture.

Author-Name: Jerdee, Thomas H.
Abstract: As we rapidly approach the 21st century, current human resource management policies emphasizing early retirement may prove shortsighted. Changing demographics and projected labor shortages in certain critical occupations may require a reversal of present early retirement policies. This article reports the views of a national sample of 897 executives on work and retirement. We report their reactions to pressures for early retirement, their responses to proposed incentives to delay retirmeent, and finally, their planned post retirement activities. Their responses have important implications for revising human resource policies in the years ahead.

Title: Strategic human resource management and firm effectiveness in industries experiencing decline
Author-Name: Cook, Deborah Smith
Author-Name: Ferris, Gerald R.
Abstract: Unstable economic conditions, in conjunction with other external and internal influences, have prompted attempts to understand the nature of organizational decline. While a number of issues have been carefully considered in recent theory and research, little effort has been made to consider the implications of human resource management practices for firms in declining industries. The present study examined human resource practices in three industries that experienced decline, and investigated the relationship of organizational performance with effective human resource management.

Title: Management roles in the implementation of participative management systems
Author-Name: Fisher, K. Kim
Abstract: Although participative management supposedly cures the ills of low morale and productivity, managers in these organizations are often frustrated with their jobs. Part of this frustration may come from not understanding their changing roles in participative work systems. In this paper I introduce a model of the cycle of participative management which outlines the stages of organization maturity and the appropriate management roles for each stage. I also discuss how the manager acts as a Leader, Facilitator, Enabler, and Coach. My purpose is to help Human Resource Managers understand how management roles will change as the organization evolves to a mature participative work system and to show how they can support this challenging transformation.

Title: Reinforcing organizational defensive routines: An unintended human resources activity
Author-Name: Argyris, Chris
Abstract: Although human resources professionals are against the proliferation of defensive routines, they often design programs that reinforce them. This paper examines one organization in depth in order to illustrate how its human resources professionals acted in ways that unintentionally reinforced the very defensive routines that they were trying to reduce. Organizational defensive routines organized into self-reinforcing loops can result in lack of effective line leadership and increasing difficulty for management development, organizational development, education, organizational diagnosis, and compensation to achieve their objectives.

Title: Symbolic management of human resources
Author-Name: Berg, Per‐Olof
Abstract: This article begins with the observation of three recent and interrelated trends in management: corporate advertising, internal marketing, and strategic management of human resources. The basic argument is that these trends indicate a shift in managerial focus, from the management of human resources to the management of symbolic resources. Symbolic resources are here seen as symbols, metaphors, images, etc., which in a condensed form represent complex organizational phenomena, and which can be developed and utilized to guide strategic corporate action. There are four types of “symbolic resources” that seem to be particularly powerful: historical resources (i.e., elements of the corporate saga or epic), basic values and ideologies (as expressed in the corporate policies), particular activities and events (as anniversaries and celebrations), and finally, the company lifestyle (or ethos).

Title: Leadership and strategic change
Author-Name: Edström, Anders
Abstract: This article reports on a study of the development and diffision of a new corporate philosophy in three corporate divisions of the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). The corporate philosophy, representing strongly held assumptions, beliefs, and values guide the strategic change. Its development and diffusion is found to be directly influenced by the formation of a strategic role constellation in each division. The division managers have personally recruited a constellation which is consistent with their own beliefs and values. Implications of the findings for selection, recruitment, and development of key managers are pinpointed.

Title: Fostering and facilitating entrepreneurship in organizations: Implications for organization structure and human resource management practices
Author-Name: Schuler, Randall S.
Abstract: Two particularly important factors involved in successful corporate entrepreneurship are organization structure and human resource management practices. By selecting and implementing the appropriate structure and practices, human resource professionals can systematically foster and facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship within their organizations. The more that new and different entrepreneurial activities are needed, the more that complete structural arrangements as well as policy and procedure flexibility are needed. In this article, structural practices appropriate for different degrees of entrepreneurial activity are described. But because appropriate structural practices alone are not sufficient for effectiveness, necessary human resource management practices are also described in detail. Throughout, implications for structural and human resource management practices in advancing entrepreneurship are considered.

Abstract: The Tichy and Ulrich (1984) framework for transformational leadership is applied within the setting of a number of U.S. trade unions currently undergoing a realignment of their goals and objectives. That framework will be used to delineate both the transformational role being played by leaders in these unions and the opportunities for transformational leadership that are being underutilized.

Abstract: This study of common patterns of communication and behavior in mergers and acquisitions relied on a survey of twenty-one managers and professionals in acquired organizations in three separate mergers or acquisitions (M/A). The survey used focused interviews to construct three cases. Common patterns are identified and a syndrome is specified connecting communication variables with rumor mills, employee turnover, and employee commitment to the new organization.

Title: Defining the Activities and Effectiveness of the Human Resource Department: A Multiple Constituency Approach
Author-Name: Tsui, Anne S.
Abstract: Human resource strategy research has focused primarily on the effects of business objectives and other organizational contingencies on organizational-wide human resource systems and policies. Relatively little attention has been paid to the human resource function at the business implementation level. The multiple constituency approach was proposed to be a meaningful conceptual basis for analyzing the activities and effectiveness of the human resource department at the firm's operating level. A research project involving three separate studies found support on the validity of the multiple constituency approach. Constituency perspectives differed in both the activities desired of the human resource department and criteria meaningful for evaluating its effectiveness. The largest discrepancy was between constituencies with a strategic focus and constituencies with an operational orientation. Implications of the research findings and of the multiple constituency approach for strategic human resource management research and practice are discussed.

Title: Human Resources Management Innovation
Author-Name: Kossek, Ellen Ernst
Abstract: Guided by a general manager's perspective of human resources management (HRM), this paper identifies key factor affecting the introduction of HRM innovations in organizations. Because the essence of market and technological leadership is the development of the organizational capacity to carry out inventive ideas, it is critical to understand the main forces influencing HRM innovation. Following a definition of HRM innovation, six propositions are discussed using current and historical examples. Since HRM innovation also involves change in the social system of the organization, the adoption and diffusion of these innovations can be attributed not only to external environmental forces but also to social processes.

Abstract: This paper examines the roots of Britain's training problem, drawing links with long-standing industrial decline and lack of competitiveness. It is argued that training has considerable strategic importance in this context, but major attitudinal and structural obstacles are restricting the ability of British management to implement the necessary changes in their human resource management. A major research program in the UK aimed at understanding and facilitating strategic change and human resource management is described in detail.

Title: Wage Differences Between Men and Women: Performance Appraisal Ratings vs. Salary Allocation as the Locus of Bias
Author-Name: Drazin, Robert
Author-Name: Auster, Ellen R.
Abstract: This article explores the nature and origins of wage differences between men and women in the context of a single large financial services organization. Data collected on 800 women and 1831 men showed that modest wage differences do exist and that they tend to be concentrated primarily in managerial levels. Two possible sources of bias in evaluation were assessed – performance appraisal ratings and the translation of performance appraisal ratings into salay. Our analyses showed that performance appraisal ratings, on average, do not differ between men and women at the same level; however, the relationship between performance appraisal ratings and salary was stronger for men then women, particularly at higher levels. This suggests that the salary allocation process, and not the performance appraisal process, may be the source of bias in large organizations.

Title: Pacific Basin Managers: A Gaijin, Not a Woman
Author-Name: Adler, Nancy J.
Abstract: Pacific Rim business is the fastest growing in the world. To remain competitive, no major North American firm dare ignore Asia. Traditionally, very few women have held managerial and executive positions in Asia, Can North American firms successfully send female expatriate managers to Asia or must they limit international management positions to men? To answer this question, fifty-two women were interviewed, each of whom had held at least one management position in Asia. They were overwhelmingly successful. The study describes who the women are, how they were chosen, and their professional experience as female expatriate managers in Asia.

Title: Female Managers in Britain – A Comparative Perspective
Author-Name: Davidson, Marilyn J.
Author-Name: Cooper, Cary L.
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present the current position of female managers in Britain and examine the similarities and differences between male and female managers. In terms of managerial efficiency and performance per se, the evidence strongly suggests that there are far more similarities than differences between the way men and women ‘manage’. However, there are some major sex differences in relation to demographic profiles, job status and employment factors, career development, occupational stress levels, and attitudes towards female managers compared to their male counterparts. One in nine managers in Britain are women and less than one per cent occupy senior management positions. Women managers tend to have to be more highly qualified than men managers, are more likely to be single or divorced, and encounter more prejudice and discrimination in the work environment. In addition, compared to male managers female managers have to cope with additional stresors stemming both from their work and home lives. It is suggested that many of these differences are hampering the career prospects of women in management and contributing towards the difficulties they have in reaching the higher levels of management compared to men. Finally, recommendations for changes in corporate and legislative policies are also proposed.

Title: Sex Differences in Responsiveness to Organizational Career Management
Author-Name: Pazy, Asya
Abstract: This is a study of differences between women and men in their responsiveness to formal organizational career management. Questionnaire data from 272 men and 101 women were analyzed. It was found that women's individual career variables were mostly similar to men's, but their responsiveness to organizational career management was higher than men's. Women's career effectiveness (performance, attitudes, identity, and adaptability) and career planning increased when the level of perceived organizational career management was high. The sex difference remained even when the effects of two other responsiveness-reducing factors, managerial position and tenure, were controlled. The results are interpreted in terms of women's cognitive construction of organizational reality. It is suggested that human resource managers have to distinguish between two different objectives: enhancing women's effectiveness vs. enhancing their career progress. To attain the first objective, formal career management systems should be developed. To attain the second, it is argued that women need to relate differently to the informal organizational system.

Title: Status Report: The Corporation and Trends in Family Issues
Author-Name: Stautberg, Susan S.
Abstract: The two-paycheck family is making new demands on the corporation. With both parents involved in family and work life, the corporation, if it wants to keep these professionals in the workforce, must consider new, flexible approaches to management. Under review are policies concerning parental leave, child care, flexible work schedules, cafeteria-style benefits, and a new corporate consideration of the importance of family life. At this time, it appears that the greatest impetus will come from the courts and Congress, with family-oriented legislations being considered for the presidential year of 1988.

Human resources are people, and when people suffer some harm or loss for which they are not themselves responsible, as in a plant closing or corporate re-structuring, then ethical analysis is needed in addition to the more common financial, legal, and behavioral forms of reasoning. Ethical analysis involves an evaluation of the impacts of the proposed managerial action upon the members of the organization and the members of the society, and then justification of those impacts according to one of the first principles or essential values of normative philosophy. None of these first principles or essential values are adequate by themselves to justify a decision in an ethical dilemma, but taken together they do help in arriving at a decision that can be considered to be “right” and “proper” and “just”.

Title: How Selecting and Socializing Newcomers Influences Insiders
Author-Name: Sutton, Robert I.
Author-Name: Louis, Meryl Reis
Abstract: The organizational literature on selection and socialization concentrate on what happens to recruits from interview through acculturation. In contrast, little has been written about what happens to “insiders” as they choose new members and help bring them on board. In this paper, we demonstrate how involvement with newcomers can have profound effects on insiders' attitudes, performance, and knowledge. We emphasize how managers can harness these rarely discussed features of selection and socialization to enhance the effectiveness of veteran members and their organizations.

Title: Challenges in the Management of Diversified Companies: The Changin Face of Corporate Labor Relations
Author-Name: Tatum Christiansen, E.
Abstract: For at least twenty-five years, researchers in general management have maintained that well managed companies succeed in achieving a tight fit between long-term corporate goals and their policies for marketing, production, and other functions. Rarely is the nature of this fit explored in detail or in breadth, particularly for diversified firms. While it is generally acknowledged that managing a diversified firm is different and more complex than managing a single business, our knowledge has been sketchy regarding ways to achieve this fit between functional policies and corporate strategy in diversified companies. The author presents the results of a two-part study which investigates how managers in such firms are achieving fit between corporate strategy and the labor relations function. The study throws some light on problems facing firms across the country as they respond to major shifts occurring in U.S. labor markets.

Title: Perspectives on the Implementation of Participative Approaches
Author-Name: Margulies, Newton
Author-Name: Black, Stewart
Abstract: Participative management, both in terms of specific techniques and as a broad value, has become more utilized in recent years. Unfortunately, often participative management approaches have been inappropriately and consequently unsuccessfully implemented. From a review of the literature, influential conditions for the successful implementation of participative management have been identified. These conditions are discussed and then illustrated via a recent case study.

Title: New Business Development: A Challenge for Transformational Leadership
Author-Name: MacMillan, Ian C.
Abstract: This article analyzes how the behavior of CEOs of major divisions of corporations who are successful at new business development differ in behavior from those who attempted new business development programs and failed. Successful top managers affected organization transformation via three major differences in leadership behavior. Successful CEOs inspired pervasive commitment throughout their division. They built confidence in their subordinates' ability to develop new business. Finally, they found ways of applying appropriate disciplines to the process, particularly in the ara of management of failure. Challenges for the HRM function in terms of orchestrating these CEO behaviors are discussed.

Abstract: This article presents a model for anticipating and responding to the human resource management needs of business. It presents methods for analyzing both external fit (Human Resource Management fits the development state of the organization) and internal fit (the organization components complementing and supporting each other) of human resource management. The model and its application result from research conducted in thirty organizations ranging in size from 2000 to 300,000 employees and varing in industry from financial services to consumer products. To develop and demonstrate the application of the model, we present in-depth case studies of four organizations. Implications of the model are discussed.

Title: New challenges for Japanese multinationals: Is organization adaptation their achilles heel?
Author-Name: Bartlett, Christopher A.
Author-Name: Yoshihara, Hideki
Abstract: As the number, size, and complexity of Japanese multinational companies' (MNCs) overseas operations increase, many of them have begun to realize that they face some fundamental and difficult organizational challenges. Drawing on research undertaken with several large and successful Japanese MNCs, the authors define the nature and source of some of these organizational challenges, and describe some approaches that can be taken to resolving them. The article starts with a brief assessment of the traditional organizational capabilities and existing managerial approaches of Japanese companies, comparing them to the emerging challenges in the international environment. Then, after identifying some constraints and barriers to an effective response to the new demands, the authors propose a series of actions to overcome the problems.

Title: Self‐renewal of the Japanese firm and the human resource strategy
Author-Name: Nonaka, Ikujiro
Abstract: Traditional “Japanese personnel management” that has long been considered as the key for Japan's competitive success now needs fundamental restructuring in order to meet the challenges of a stagnant economy, matured domestic market, and the rise of NICs (Newly Industrialized Countries) in international markets. The self-renewal of Japanese firms can be achieved by a paradigm shift at the corporate strategy level: from a production orientation to a product orientation. In accordance with this paradigm shift, leading Japanese firms have started reforming their Human Resource Management (HRM) function from a productivity-centered to a creativity-centered one— creative HRM. Creative HRM has three pillars: (1) the creation of the strategic vision through commitment of the employees, (2) an entrepreneurial middle management as a key strategic node, and (3) multi-dimensional personnel management. Creation and realization of the strategic vision through the active commitment of an entrepreneurial middle management is necessary for the self-renewal of the firm. “Japanese Personnel Management” that might have been overadapted to the traditional strategic paradigm is now transforming itself from a “group-centered” personnel administration to an “individual-centered” one. While Western companies have been adopting Japanese “groupism” to reconstruct their production systems, Japanese companies have started introducing Western “individualism” to encourage creative self-transformation. But no system or technique is truly effective without human commitment, and this requires a fundamental paradigm shift for Japanese firms.

Title: Expatriate reduction and strategic control in American multinational corporations
Author-Name: Kobrin, Stephen J.
Abstract: The significant reduction in the use of home country expatriates abroad by American multinationals is generally taken positively, reflecting internationalization, the environmental competence of host country nationals, equity, and the cost of maintaining Americans abroad. In this article I dissent, arguing that the phase-out of expatriates has gone too far, much further in fact than European or Japanese competition and that the dominant reason for the cutback is the difficulty Americans have in adapting to overseas assignments and the high failure rate they have experienced. I conclude that expatriate reduction has significant consequences for the strategic management of multinational corporations: reduced identification with the worldwide organization and its objectives, difficulty exercising control through personnel, and a lack of opportunities for Americans to gain international expertise through assignments abroad. Although I do not advocate returning to the ineffective and inequitable over-reliance on home country nationals, I argue that a corps of expatriates performs a function valuable to the MNC and that a means must be found to develop a group of managers who identify with the organization as a whole and provide overseas experience to home country managers.

Title: Strategic alliances, organizational learning, and competitive advantage: The HRM agenda
Author-Name: Pucik, Vladimir
Abstract: In the context of strategic alliances that involve competitive collaboration, the competitive advantage of a firm can be protected only through its capability to accumulate invisible assets by a carefully planned and executed process of organizational learning. As this process is embedded in people, many of the necessary capabilities are closely linked to HRM strategies and practice. The article advocates that the transformation of the HR system to support the process of organizational learning is the key strategic task facing the HR function in firms engaged in international cooperative ventures.

Abstract: This article, based on a case study of Digital Equipment Corporation, examines issues raised by efforts to stabilize employment. The specific case is a large program which restructured and reduced employment without resorting to layoffs. The article describes the DEC process, the key choices which underly the procedures, and provides data on the consequences for individuals and the firm. It then explores the implications of the DEC experience for the broad human resource principles and actions which must underlie any effort to stabilize employment.

Abstract: Downsizing is a competitive strategy which many organizations use, yet little is known about organizational policies related to downsizings. A survey of mid-western personnel directors in manufacturing firms was conducted to capture organizational policies and assess perceptions and attitudes regarding downsizing. Seniority was cited as the overwhelming criterion used to determine layoffs. Nonunion firms considered performance significantly more than did unionized organizations in determining layoffs. Few alternatives to layoffs were actually considered, which is not surprising because 94% of the HR managers had less than two months to plan and implement the downsizing. Implications for white collar employees, prescriptions for HR practice, and future research are discussed.

Title: The experience of burnout and work/non‐work success in male and female engineers: A matched‐pairs comparison
Author-Name: Etzion, Dalia
Abstract: This paper explores the experience of burnout and success in the professional and private lives of people in technical careers. Participants in the study were 51 male and 51 female engineers, who were matched as pairs on a variety of personal and job-related variables. An analysis of the data shows that the sampling design worked: the two groups are very similar in their organizational positions, share a similar outlook on their jobs, and have similar orientations towards their careers and lives. However, gender differences were revealed in the interrelationship between work and private life and its effect on measures of well-being such as feelings of burnout, satisfaction, enjoyment, and perceived success. Results indicate that male engineers are better able to integrate work success with private life than their female counterparts. For men, work and non-work success are compatible, while for women they seem to conflict. The results are discussed in the light of a theoretical proposition to view burnout in a person/environment-fit framework. Implications are drawn for career consultants and human resource managers in organizations that rely on technical expertise.

Title: Career development and participation at work: Time for mating?
Author-Name: Arthur, Michael B.
Abstract: Both career development and participation at work activities have emphasized a “prospecting” approach to inquiry. Although jointly inspired by the humanistic ethic, the two ventures have grown as separate streams of inquiry through their distinct responses to economic, hierarchical, technological, reductionist, and systems imperatives about work. A contrasting “mating” approach to inquiry is proposed, with the various imperatives becoming redefined as shared objects for further study. The proposal is supported by a set of diagnostic questions, and illustrated by a comparison between separate “Knowledge for Pay” and “Pay for Knowledge” human resource management initiatives. The possibility of broader application of the mating principle to other human resource management efforts is briefly considered.

Abstract: Differences between Chinese and U.S. human resource management systems are described with respect to fundamental organization and work-related assumptions about people and performance, rewards, training and development, and educational background of HR practitioners. We identify key differences that present impediments to the modernization of HRM practices in Sino-U.S. cooperative ventures, and then, present a normative framework for the introduction of modem HRM practices into these ventures. We conclude with implications for both research and practice that focus primarily on integrating individuals and the enterprise, as well as integrating the enterprise with social and economic goals.

Title: National vs. corporate culture: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Schneider, Susan C.
Abstract: Corporate culture has been described as the “glue” that holds organizations together by providing cohesiveness and coherence among the parts. Multinational companies are increasingly interested in promoting corporate culture to improve control, coordination, and integration of their subsidiaries. Yet these subsidiaries are embedded in local national cultures wherein the underlying basic assumptions about people and the world may differ from that of the national and corporate culture of the multinational. These differences may hinder the acceptance and implementation of human resource practices, such as career planning, appraisal and compensation systems, and selection and socialization. This article discusses the assumptions about people and about the world underlying these HRM practices as they may differ from those of the national culture of the subsidiary. Finally, issues concerning the use of corporate culture as a mechanism for globalization will be raised.

Title: Chinese women managers: A comparison with their U.S. and asian counterparts
Author-Name: Hildebrandt, Herbert W.
Author-Name: Liu, Jinyun
Abstract: Questionnaire and interview data were gathered on 150 People's Republic of China female managers who were contrasted with their counterparts in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Chinese female managers have little job mobility, pursue careers appraised by the Party and influenced by central government planning, work the most hours per week, and recommend the political/ideology path as the fastest route to the top. They are comparatively less educated, progress under a patrilineal tradition, recommend business courses as a means of preparation for managerial responsibilities, and slowly are gaming opportunities in fob selection.

Title: Plant closings: Lessons from the maine experience
Author-Name: Baker, Andrew M.
Abstract: This paper discusses the economics behind plant closings, suggests a possible role for public policy to ameliorate the effects of closings in some situations, and reviews Maine's experience with mandatory advance notice of closings and severance payments. The possibility of a less flexible labor market in Maine is noted, as are areas for future research. Finally, the economic and political history of Maine's experience with plant closing legislation is discussed in terms of its implications for similar legislation at the federal level.

Title: Key to the future: The strategic impact of union presidential elections
Author-Name: Spector, Bert
Abstract: Fundamental changes in the conduct of U.S. Labor relations have led unions to reconsider their future strategies. While scholars have focused attention on the content of their strategic choices, far less attention has been paid to the process of managing a change process within unions. This article analyzes a recent presidential election held within the United Steelworkers to suggest a framework for understanding how elections can impact on charges in the strategic direction of unions.

Title: Strategic determinants of managerial labor markets: A career systems view
Author-Name: Sonnenfeld, Jeffrey A.
Author-Name: Peiperl, Maury A.
Author-Name: Kotter, John P.
Abstract: This paper proposes a four-cell typology of career systems, which describes the way different corporate strategies reflect the nature of executive labor markets. The two critical dimensions of the model, “supply flow” and “assignment flow,” reflect the external and internal movement of executives. We use recent examples from industry to demonstrate the way in which business and career system strategies align. We then examine individual background and personality variables, drawn from a ten-year study tracking 125 MBA graduates, to show how executives sort themselves into the career system best suited to their needs.

Title: From surface to deep corporate entrepreneurship
Author-Name: Sathe, Vijay
Abstract: This article will first describe and analyze two very different patterns of entrepreneurship found in large American companies studied by the author. “Surface entrepreneurship” denotes the pattern of entrepreneurial activity found in companies where entrepreneurship was seen as an important business objective that management was trying to promote and accomplish. In contrast, “deep entrepreneurship” denotes the pattern found in companies where entrepreneurship was an important shared value. European firms currently being studied combine elements from these two patterns. These studies suggest the fundamental questions that must be addressed to promote entrepreneurship. Some answers in the form of recommendations to management are presented.

Abstract: Some organizations are able to do effective succession planning that is linked to corporate objectives, while others fail. This article examines the culture, strategy, structure, and other design features of two companies in order to elucidate the barriers to and facilitators of effective succession. An organization-centered approach that integrates the succession system with the organization's design can add value both to succession activities and overall business functioning.

Title: Emerging organizational regimes in high technology firms: The bi‐modal form
Author-Name: Bahrami, Homa
Author-Name: Evans, Stuart
Abstract: Organizational regimes of high technology firms need to accommodate a range of seemingly-paradoxical imperatives–such as creativity vis-a-vis discipline, and flexibility vis-a-vis cohesion–each requiring a different structural emphasis. This has resulted in the emergence of “bi-modal” organizational forms, defined as structures which are simultaneously centralized and decentralized. Based on a five-year field study of 33 firms in “Silicon Valley”, this paper describes the structural configurations of high technology firms at various stages of development, and examines organizational mechanisms deployed to achieve bi-modality.

Title: Strategic job analysis

Author-Name: Konz, Andrea Marcus
Abstract: The application of job analysis techniques makes the implicit assumption that information about a job as it presently exists may be used to develop programs to recruit, select, train, and appraise people for the job as it will exist in the future. Given a rapidly changing internal and external world it is likely that many jobs will change in the future. This article reviews some new techniques that, when added to traditional job analysis procedures, may facilitate strategic planning for the development of personnel procedures such as selection and training. Examples of the new technique are presented, followed by a discussion of some topics requiring future thought and research.

Abstract: Contemporary human resource planning (HRP) practice is described on the basis of a survey of 137 companies. Results indicate widespread use of simple forecasting techniques and increased acceptance of HRP during the turbulent 1980s, supporting the notion that HRP adapts to the business environment and has increasingly become a line management process. The forecasting component of HRP was found to serve several functions, the most frequent being developmental. HRP problems have evolved into concerns about the strategic planning role of HRP in the 1990s as opposed to the more technical issues of the past.

Title: A psychoanalytic attributional model for subordinate poor performance
Author-Name: Sankowsky, Daniel
Abstract: Managers and subordinates often have divergent perceptions as to the cause of a subordinate's poor performance. Normally, this is considered to be a significant problem in that it is correlated with a deterioration in productivity and in manager-subordinate relations. The position taken here is that under certain circumstances, convergence of perceptions can be even more damaging to the psychological well-being of the subordinate. These circumstances include the following: the manager's attributing the poor performance to the subordinate's lack of ability or lack of effort; the manager's being able to influence the subordinate to agree with this assessment; and the attribution being fundamentally inaccurate.

Abstract: Many Human Resource (HR) professionals feel and believe that they have made progress during the 1980s. Unfortunately, without data to benchmark progress, assessments must depend on perception rather than evidence. To move beyond belief towards a national HR database, this article reports research on over 10,000 individuals in 1200 businesses in 91 firms. It establishes a benchmark for HR practices and HR professionals. It also highlights areas where HR professionals may focus attention to become more successful as business partners.

Title: Human resources management and organizational effectiveness: High technology entrepreneurial startup firms in israel
Author-Name: Bamberger, Peter
Author-Name: Bacharach, Samuel
Author-Name: Dyer, Lee
Abstract: Human Resource (HR) researchers have a tendency to generalize their results and prescriptions across a wide range of organizations without regard to possible contingencies. This can be dangerous. This article demonstrates the nature of the difficulties that can arise in two ways. First, by comparing hypotheses concerning the relationships between HR policies and practices and firm performance derived from the high-tech and entrepreneurial literatures, and highlighting the inconsistencies. Second, by testing the applicability of these hypotheses to a hybrid form of organization, namely, the high-tech entrepreneurial startup firm. The results show some support for the high-tech model, and more limited support for the entrepreneurial model, suggesting the need for more contingency-based notions of HR strategy. Implications are drawn for both research and practice.

Positive discipline has been implemented at Union Carbide with successful results: constructive interaction with individual employee problems encourages employee self-discipline and recommitment to the organization's goals.

Title: What do we really know about EAPs?
Author-Name: Luthans, Fred
Author-Name: Waldersee, Robert
Abstract: The time has come to make a comprehensive, critical assessment of the increasingly popular EAPs. To date, with very few exceptions, only glowing reports in the literature are available. This EAP literature is reinterpreted and methodological flaws are identified in analyzing usage patterns, legal issues, success rates, and cost-benefit calculations. The real and potential weaknesses and limitations need to be recognized in order to make EAPs more effective for the 1990s.

Title: Expatriates in their own home: A new twist in the human resource management strategies of japanese mncs
Author-Name: Bird, Allan
Author-Name: Mukuda, May
Abstract: Liaison positions in an overseas subsidiary represent a vital link to the parent company. Staffing this position constitutes a critical HRM decision. Based on exploratory interviews conducted with personnel managers and foreign employees, we examine an emerging approach to meeting this staffing need which entails hiring non-Japanese as employees of the parent company, retaining them at headquarters in Japan for three to four years, then assigning them back to their own countries as expatriates. We discuss this approach's underlying rationale, its advantages and disadvantages, and its potential implications for future IHRM developments within Japanese MNCs.

Title: Stemming the exodus of women managers
Author-Name: Rosen, Benson
Author-Name: Miguel, Mabel
Author-Name: Peirce, Ellen
Abstract: Survey findings based on a national sample of CEOs and human resource managers indicate that over 50% of organizations have experienced moderate to great difficulty attracting and retaining women managers and professionals. Respondents perceived that the most serious career problems encountered by women revolve around organizational politics, career development opportunities, and family conflicts. Existing and needed human resource management policies in response to these problems are reported. A series of additional analyses highlight differences across industries, and according to company size and stage in the corporate life cycle. Based on survey findings, recommendations are discussed for human resource management practitioners concerned with increasing their companies' abilities to actively compete for and retain women managers.

Title: Mentoring as an antidote to stress during corporate trauma
Author-Name: Kram, Kathy E.
Author-Name: Hall, Douglas T.
Abstract: This article examines mentoring as a potentially useful resource in an organization's adaptation to global competition and the need for improved learning capabilities. We were surprised to find that mentoring relationships were perceived as more desirable under conditions of corporate stress, low job challenge, and low job involvement. We were further surprised to find that individuals in early and later career stages were as likely, or more likely than, their midcareer colleagues to embrace the mentoring role. Thus, it appears that mentoring may be more readily available as an antidote to stress than previously considered, and that it may be an important form of coping with the stressful, nonrewarding conditions that typically characterize corporate downsizing. Not only is mentoring an important form of promoting development (for self and for others), but it also may represent a valuable vehicle for social support and learning during times of major corporate change.

Title: A practical but theory‐based framework for selecting cross‐cultural training methods
Author-Name: Black, J. Stewart
Author-Name: Mendenhall, Mark
Abstract: Increased internationalization in the economic, political, and social arenas has led to greater interpersonal cross-cultural contact. Because much of this contact has not been successful, cross-cultural training has been proposed by many scholars as a means of facilitating more effective interaction. However, most firms do not utilize cross-cultural training. The cross-cultural training framework proposed in this article is based on both theory and a review of the cross-cultural training literature. The contingency framework proposed provides a practical guide for determining the method and rigor of cross-cultural training most effective in various circumstances.

Title: Using human resource management to enhance competitiveness: Lessons from four excellent companies
Author-Name: Kydd, Christine T.
Author-Name: Oppenheim, Lynn
Abstract: Recent research has emphasized the strategic focus that human resource management must have in order for an organization to fully utilize its human resources in a competitive market. However, few empirical studies have been done to date regarding how human resource planning should be linked to strategy. An extensive in-depth study of four large, complex, and very successful companies supports the widespread belief that human resource management can be a powerful tool to enhance competitiveness when policies and practices are logically driven by a firm's strategy and by the key environmental factors it faces. This article describes that study and looks at how the areas of selection, appraisal, reward, and development are handled by these firms. Based on both the specific policies and the actual practices as perceived by middle managers (those that implement the policies), the article presents a contingency framework which offers guidelines as to how certain HRM practices should be implemented to gain competitive advantage.

Author-Name: Siehl, Caren
Author-Name: Smith, Dayle
Abstract: The turnover of management following a merger or acquisition is a significant, yet understudied, human resource issue. We propose that the relevant HR question is not merely how to retain top managers, but of equal importance, whether or not top management retention should be an objective. We present a model that integrates the retention process with the overall integration strategy being pursued by the acquiring firm. The model prompts a discussion of those factors that influence the decision as to whether the top management of the acquired firm should be retained. We conclude by identifying appropriate HR tactics for managing the retention process.

Title: Retraining midcareer managers: Career history and self‐efficacy beliefs
Author-Name: Hill, Linda A.
Author-Name: Elias, Jaan
Abstract: Many corporations are retraining midcareer managers in order to combat employee obsolescence and boost corporate competitiveness. The receptivity of midcareer managers to retraining is mixed. Those managers who believe they can master new work-related learning (in the terms of this study, those who have positive self-efficacy in learning beliefs) are most amenable to retraining. The objective of the present study was to determine the antecedents of positive self-efficacy beliefs for midcareer managers facing retraining. We discovered that managers' advancement potential and the relevance of their previous training had a profound impact on their self-efficacy beliefs. These findings have important practical implications. The seeds of receptivity to retraining are planted throughout managers' careers. Hence, retraining should not be viewed on a program-by-program basis, but rather should be understood in the broader context of corporate life and individual career history. To prepare for the inevitable corporate evolution and change demanded in a dynamic business environment, senior executives and human resource managers should be proactive in creating those conditions that facilitate the development of positive self-efficacy in learning beliefs.

Title: The threat of professional obsolescence: How do professionals at different career stages experience it and cope with it?
Author-Name: Pazy, Asya
Abstract: The accelerated rate of scientific and technological progress puts heavy demands on professionals. To be able to function effectively in the world of modern technology, professionals must continuously update their knowledge and skills so that they do not stay behind and are not threatened by obsolescence. Managers and human resource practitioners need to understand how the threat of obsolescence is perceived, and what professionals actually do to alleviate this threat. An exploratory study, based on in-depth interviews with 50 professionals in the Israeli high-tech industry, identified a variety of meanings that professionals assign to the threat of obsolescence, and a variety of updating activities in which they engage in order to cope with these threats. First, three meaning categories were identified: threat in the context of the self, threat in the immediate social context, and threat in the context of the job market. The essence and prevalence of these meanings were different at different career stages. Second, three types of updating resources were identified: structured opportunities, information material, and interpersonal exchange. Both the availability and the utilization of these resources varied with career stage. Implications of the multifaceted view of obsolescence to the management of professional human resources are discussed.

Abstract: Individual assessment involves one psychologist making an assessment of an individual for personnel-related purposes. Individual assessment practice is reviewed, and research on reliability is presented. A study examining the comparability of conclusions reached by consumers is presented. Eighty-six students and thirty-eight managers read nine narrative assessment reports (three of each of three job candidates) and attempted to determine which reports described the same candidate. None of the subjects could correctly group the nine reports; a sizeable proportion did no better than chance in grouping the reports. Implications for assessors and consumers of individual assessments are discussed.

Title: Corporate restructuring, ownership‐disciplined alignment, and the reorganization of management
Author-Name: Useem, Michael
Author-Name: Gottlieb, Martin M.
Abstract: Intensified focus on shareholder value during the 1980s led to a stress on consistent, integrated linkages among major elements of company organization. Drawing on senior management interviews and documents from six large publicly-traded corporations and six small firms, we argue that this ownership-disciplined alignment devolved decision-making authority into operating business units; contracted headquarters' managers and staff functions; heightened stress on management selection; expanded use of performance-based compensation; and created mechanisms for internal ownership. Changes in each area of managerial organization have appeared before, but they are now explicitly and systematically focused around enhancing shareholder value.

Title: The expansive executive: How the drive to mastery helps and hinders organizations
Author-Name: Kaplan, Robert E.
Abstract: What drives executives has a great deal to do with how they lead. Executives generally are highly motivated to attain mastery—to achieve at a high level, to be exceptionally capable, to be acknowledged as masterful, and so on. An intense drive to mastery is certainly a prerequisite to effective executive leadership. But in some executives there can be virtually no limit to the extent of their ambition for themselves and their organizations. These driven individuals are capable of going to counterproductive extremes to satisfy their appetites for mastery. So, based on intensive research on character and leadership on senior managers, this article shows how the “expansive” temperament can be a boon or a bane to an organization's existence.

Title: “Please don't make me a hero”: A re‐examination of corporate heroes
Author-Name: Wilkins, Alan L.
Author-Name: Perry, Lee Tom
Author-Name: Checketts, Alan G.
Abstract: Recent discussions of corporate heroes focus on benefits without examining costs. Although our perceptions are not entirely negative, we have discovered several reasons to be cautious about corporate heroes. We present some of the potential problems associated with creating heroes, and another set of dysfunctions occurring once heroes have been created. Our intention is not to debunk heroes, but to attach a cautionary note to their use in organizations. We fully expect the natural emergence of heroes in many organizations, but also propose that managers can accomplish as much, and often less hazardously, by working on perspective, praise, and trying to influence daily practice in their organizations. This approach is both more explicit and direct in infusing organizations with the same benefits of motivation and meaning derived from having heroes. Moreover, it can lay a foundation of values that ultimately determines what kinds of individuals emerge as heroes.

Title: Management and organization principles for the information economy
Author-Name: Davidson, William H.
Author-Name: Davis, Stanley M.
Abstract: Industrial era management models are giving way to a new paradigm. The widespread application of information technology is driving change in underlying business processes and market structures. The impact of such change on management and organization models is only beginning to be felt, but certain principles and directions are becoming apparent. This article describes the mainstream elements of the emerging business paradigm and discusses a series of implications for the human resource management function.

Title: A new paradigm for customer and supplier relationships
Author-Name: Ashkenas, Ronald N.
Abstract: As boundaries between companies blur, the traditional assumptions that have guided relationships between suppliers and customers for much of the past century may need to be recrafted. This article examines these old assumptions and their limitations and suggests a new set of assumptions—a new paradigm—to guide companies towards greater competitiveness in the boundaryless world of the '90s and beyond. The Human Resource function can play a leadership role in the transformation to this new paradigm—using four strategies that are outlined here.

Title: Key interfaces: New opportunities for human resources
Author-Name: Lake, Dale G.
Abstract: A shift is occurring in traditional views regarding vendors to organizations. The shift moves from the view of suppliers as providing commodities for which the only consideration is price toward recognizing the value they add to the manufacturing process when they contribute higher level assemblies as partners. This article uses an extended example of one company making the shift from vendor to strategic supplier partner. As this shift evolves, major savings of time and dollars occur as do major reductions in complexity. Finally, this article describes the significant contribution that the HR role can make in the transformation of vendors into partners. Specific actions are recommended for the HR professional.

Abstract: In recent years, Human Resource Development has begun to focus on customers. Involving customers in traditional management development, team building, and value setting activities has enormous payoffs for firms. Customers and firms experience mutual learning, increased commitment, and long-term unity. Four cases of customer education inside General Electric illustrate the implications of customer education for HR and suggest ways in which firms can implement a customer education strategy.

Title: Creating the competitive organization of the 21st century: The boundaryless corporation
Author-Name: Devanna, Mary Anne
Author-Name: Tichy, Noel
Abstract: In the 1980s many organizations gained competitive advantage through downsizing and financial restructuring. The 1990s confront us with the need to get back to basics. Large organizations are searching for a competitive advantage by being faster than their competitors in satisfying customer needs. These competitive organizations are capable of ongoing adaptation to environmental demands. In this article the authors speculate on the way these “self-renewing” organizations are organized, the managerial processes that enable them to capitalize on speed, and the characteristics of the leaders who manage them.

Title: The managerial implications of changing work force demographics: A scoping study
Author-Name: Loveman, Gary W.
Author-Name: Gabarro, John J.
Abstract: The demographic changes currently underway in the United States have been widely anticipated and discussed by scholars and practitioners, but little is known about what impacts, if any, have already been experienced by employers. This article reports on a field study that asked managers in large US corporations to describe how and to what extent demographic changes have affected their businesses. Changing work force demographics were interpreted by managers as having two distinct components: a reduction in the growth rate and quality of potential employees, and increased gender, ethnic, and age diversity. While most firms reported managerial challenges from increased diversity, none characterized it as a serious business problem. A lack of sufficiently skilled workers for increasingly complex jobs, conversely, was seen as a major, ongoing problem.

Abstract: This article argues that future demographic shifts will alter the supply of older workers and the demand for their services. Research conducted by the authors, shows that a significant percentage of older workers not currently working would like to work and that older workers can be as cost effective and capable as younger workers. Recommendations for facilitating the greater employment of older workers conclude the article.

Title: Beyond demography: A psychographic profile of the workforce
Author-Name: Mirvis, Philip H.
Author-Name: Kanter, Donald L.
Abstract: This article examines the life and work attitudes of a national sample of the US workforce surveyed in 1990. It presents a model of work- and nonwork-related factors impinging on attitudes and the impact of these factors on high levels of cynicism found in the workforce today. The survey results show a strong correspondence between people's general perceptions of society, leadership, and the motives of other people and more specific views of their own organization, managers, and co-workers. Analyses detail the spread of cynicism among demographic segments of the workforce, considering age, race, social class, gender, occupation, and organization type. Concluding sections highlight strategies that companies such as Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Caterpillar Tractor, and others have followed to counter cynicism in their workforce.

Title: Making the Smithkline Beecham merger work
Author-Name: Burke, W. Warner
Author-Name: Jackson, Peter
Abstract: Perhaps it is an understatement to say that merging two large companies, one predominantly American and the other British, is difficult. Moreover, a merger of such magnitude takes time. This article is, therefore, a “progress report” of the merger that officially began in July of 1989 between the former SmithKline Beckman corporation with the former Beecham, plc. The authors provide suggestions and some guidelines for what facilitates an effective merger, describe the process that has occurred thus far (with particular emphasis on the establishment of values and leadership practices for the desired merger culture), and conclude with the overall model that frames the culture initiative and change effort.

The firm's associated human resource practices and issues are also discussed in detail.

Author-Name: Mirvis, Philip H.

Author-Name: Hackett, Edward J.
Abstract: This article examines the impact of computer technology on the workforce and workplace. It summarizes research and examines in practice the implementation and adoption of new technology in companies. Two cases are presented: a metal fabrication factory and a professional publishing company. Results of a pre-implementation survey given to personnel in the factory highlight how a top-down change strategy and worker's sense of mistrust and inequity, led to problems with the introduction of computerized machinery and control systems. Surveys taken one and three years after the introduction of word processing and data-based management tools in the publishing company, by comparison, show how a more participatory change strategy coupled with extensive user training and support, contribute to success with technological change and alter perceptions of the company culture.

Title: Organizational environment and business strategy: Parallel versus conflicting influences on human resource strategy in the pharmaceutical industry
Author-Name: Bamberger, Peter
Author-Name: Phillips, Bruce
Abstract: While much attention in recent years has been focused on the issue of human resource strategy, little research has been conducted on the degree to which the various forces helping to shape human resource strategy exert parallel or conflicting influences. In this article, business environment and strategy influences on corporate human resource strategies in the pharmaceutical industry are examined. In particular, data derived from corporate annual reports are used to generate a grounded theory of where, when, and why environmental influences on human resource strategy may be more or less consistent with business strategy influences across a number of human resource strategy dimensions.

It places particular focus on Project Pacer Share, a government total quality management effort underway at McClellan Air Force Base where, using quality tools and techniques, major reforms in the United States Civil Service System and human resource management are being tested. Specific human resource management initiatives that need to be undertaken to support organizationwide quality performance are presented.

Title: Identification of values relevant to business research
Author-Name: McDonald, Paul
Author-Name: Gandz, Jeffrey
Abstract: In the face of increasing global competition, Human Resource (HR) professionals have been charged with ensuring that their organizations' human assets are adding the maximum value to products and services. One way to do this is to make an effective match between individual values and those that the organization espouses and requires. This article suggests that advances in maximizing human assets are being impeded because HR professionals lack a meaningful vocabulary with which to discuss values. Lists or taxonomies of values currently in the literature (Allport, G. W., Vernon, P. E., & Lindzey, G. (1960). A study of values. Boston: Houghton Mifflin; England, G. W. (1967). The manager and his values: An international perspective from the United States, Japan, Korea, India, and Australia. Cambridge, MA: Ballinger; Rokeach, M. (1973). The nature of human values. New York: The Free Press) are not framed in the common language of contemporary business. This article presents an alternative list of values derived from interviews with representatives from the business community including senior HR managers and executive recruitment professionals. The implications of this empirically derived list of value statements for the management of human resources are discussed, including the integration of HR and strategic functions and applications within traditional HR practices.

Title: From the invisible hand to the gladhand: Understanding a careerist orientation to work
Author-Name: Feldman, Daniel C.
Author-Name: Weitz, Barton A.
Abstract: This article explores the concept of a careerist orientation to work, which is defined as the propensity to pursue career advancement through non-performance-based means. A scale is developed to measure this concept using a sample of 227 business school alumni. Exploratory empirical data suggest that careerism is associated with consistently more negative job attitudes, a greater desire to advance and to change jobs, and more frequent promotions. Implications of a careerist orientation to work for both individual career management and organizational career development are discussed.

Title: Performance measurement and management: A tool for strategy execution
Author-Name: Schneier, Craig Eric
Author-Name: Shaw, Douglas G.
Author-Name: Beatty, Richard W.
Abstract: In many organizations performance measurement and management (PMM) systems are little more than human resource bureaucracies with forms, rules, and review layers. These paper-driven systems are burdens to managers and hence are completed marginally, if at all. They are typically seen by raters as extra work and by ratees as at best irrelevant, at worst demotivating. Most PMM improvement efforts center on the most visible aspect of PMM—the form. But these quick fixes attempt to treat symptoms (e.g., leniency), while diseases (e.g., lack of managerial accountability for performance improvement or development) go unchecked. Rather than periodic revisions to the rating scales, PMM can be made relevant by linking it to strategy execution. PMM can be a vital tool for strategy execution by signaling what is really important, providing ways to measure what is important, fixing accountability for behavior and results, and helping to improve performance. In this article a PMM process is described which begins with identification of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) derived directly from business strategy. These are the basis for a PMM process that is a welcome managerial tool. The successful use of PMM as a device for strategy execution is illustrated via a case study.

Title: Making total quality work: Aligning organizational processes, performance measures, and stakeholders
Author-Name: Olian, Judy D.
Author-Name: Rynes, Sara L.
Abstract: Total quality is increasingly used by companies as an organization-wide system to achieve fully satisfied customers through the delivery of the highest quality in products and services. The goals of total quality can be achieved only if organizations entirely reform their cultures. Traditional management, operations, finance and accounting systems are reviewed against changes that are needed in organizational processes, measurement systems, and the values and behaviors of key stakeholders to overpower the status quo and shift to a total quality culture that permeates every facet of the organization. Specific company illustrations are drawn upon to show the inadequacies of these traditional areas under the new imperatives for total quality.

Abstract: This study empirically examines organizational barriers to delivering high-quality service performance as measured by customer perceptions and expectations. Using the extended service-quality model developed by Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman (Journal of Marketing, 52, 35–48) as a conceptual framework, five specific propositions implied by the model and by earlier studies contributing to its development were tested. Such testing required a complex research design involving five service companies as well as samples of customers, contact employees, and managers from each company. The results have practical implications and suggest an agenda for future organizational research.

Abstract: Profit-sharing frequently is used to link employee performance and labor costs to the profitability of organizations. It represents a significant investment. Yet, managers' decisions regarding such human resource investments frequently do not use the same financial planning frameworks typical of other investments. This article presents a case study describing how one division at Eastman Kodak Company used a strategic investment approach to plan and evaluate a profit-sharing program and describing the role of performance measurement information in that approach.

Title: Broadening the market orientation: An added focus on internal customers
Author-Name: Mohrw‐Jackson, Iris
Abstract: Though the marketing concept is the cornerstone of the marketing discipline, businesses typically describe only limited success in implementing it. An examination of the core pillars of the marketing concept points to limitations in the first pillar, the customer focus. This pillar is directed at the external customer, the person purchasing the firm's products and services with no attention to the internal customer, the employee. Whereas much attention has been directed to human resource practices in total quality management, marketers have overlooked its importance. This article describes an exploratory study based on in-depth interviews with corporate executives from a broad range of American organizations, which phenomenologically assesses the characteristics of the marketing concept and the employee activities that foster its implementation.

Abstract: Anglos and Latinos posing as job seekers applied for 468 job vacancies advertised in the Washington, D.C. area. Latino applicants received less favorable treatment than equally qualified Anglos more than 20% of the time. Discrimination was particularly prevalent for males and for jobs located in the center city, not requiring a college degree, and not widely advertised.

Title: The evolution of computer use in human resource management: Interviews with ten leaders
Author-Name: Broderick, Renae
Author-Name: Boudreau, John W.
Abstract: Using an exploratory model of the evolution of computers systems in organizations, the authors interviewed HR computer systems people in ten Fortune 500 firms considered leaders in HR computer use. Generalizable measures of growth in computer use and related changes in HR department structure, strategy, and personnel were found. These measures were used to identify three stages of growth in computer use: threshold, growth, and consolidation/strategic expansion. In the latter two stages, differences were found among firms in the way computer use evolved. These differences appeared closely related to the company's choice of technology and the centralization of the firm's key HR decision makers. The implications of the exploratory model and findings for practice and future research are discussed.

Title: Leadership and management effectiveness: A multi‐frame, multi‐sector analysis
Author-Name: Bolman, Lee G.
Author-Name: Deal, Terrence E.
Abstract: Bolman and Deal (1984, 1991) have developed four perspectives, or frames, for understanding organizations and leadership: structural, human resource, political, and symbolic. This paper reports two studies that operationalize that model. The first study uses critical incidents written by managers to assess how many and which frames they use. Most incidents show the use of one or two frames; very few contain all four. In every population, the structural frame was used frequently while the symbolic frame was rarely evident. Across different populations, the use of the human resource and political frames varied substantially. The second study used survey instruments to assess managers' frame orientations. Regression analyses show that their orientations, as perceived by colleagues, are differentially related to perceived effectiveness as manager and leader. Managerial effectiveness is related to an emphasis on rationality and organizational structure. Leadership effectiveness is linked to symbols and culture. For men and women in comparable positions, gender is unrelated to leadership orientations or to their effectiveness as managers or leaders.

Title: Lessons from the workplace: How corporate policies and attitudes lag behind workers' changing needs
Author-Name: Shellenbarger, Sue
Abstract: American companies' work-family programs and practices are lagging behind workers' changing needs and values. It is still common for employees to face antifamily discrimination by employers. The cost is seen in a decline in productivity, in quality of life, and in a loss of workers from the labor force. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Managers as fathers: Hope on the homefront
Author-Name: Delong, Thomas J.
Author-Name: Delong, Camille Collett
Abstract: Interviews with 300 male managers on their parenting style revealed obvious patterns. People's understanding of how much and in what intricate ways the reward systems of work and family affect one another is beginning to increase. The themes examined are (1) the inappropriate application of office managerial style, with its explicit tasks, to the implicit needs of family and friends, (2) the emotional spillover of work life into home life, (3) the different, often unspoken, agendas that fathers and children have when they do spend time together, and (4) the difficulty of switching roles from manager at work to father at home. The article concludes with strategies for change that were gleaned from the managers who were interviewed. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The flexible workplace: What have we learned?
Author-Name: Rodgers, Charles S.
Abstract: Data collected on white-collar and services sector jobs in over 20 large corporations show both the enormous demand from employees for more flexibility in the workplace and the considerable resistance to it by supervisors. The interest in more flexible work practices stems from the tremendous time constraints faced by the many employees with significant family responsibilities. Current practices, schedules, and management philosophy are no longer adequate for workers in this important segment of the labor force and impede them from being as productive as they could be. The major barriers and enablers to flexibility are discussed, and the data on benefits are reviewed. It is argued that if progress toward a more flexible workplace is to continue, the emphasis will have to shift from a strategy of accommodating valued employees to new ways to manage and organize how work is done. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Issues of work and family in different national contexts: How the United States, Britain, and Sweden respond
Author-Name: Bailyn, Lotte
Abstract: The ability of people to deal constructively with the needs of work and of family depends on the kind of work they do; the organization that employs them; and the economic, social, and national context in which they live. This article compares the responses to this issue in the United States, Britain, and Sweden. In the United States, the effort has been to allow women to meet male work demands. In Britain, the emphasis has been on providing flexible arrangements for mothers who work. In neither case has there been any attempt to change the rules for career success or to deal with gender roles in the family. Sweden, however, has made the effort to try to equalize gender roles. This makes many aspects of life easier, but women still are seldom found in top positions. These differences in national context determine the kinds of responses that organizations can make to the family needs of their employees. Their implication for the United States response is discussed in the paper. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Linking the worlds of work and family: Beyond the productivity trap
Author-Name: Gonyea, Judith G.
Author-Name: Googins, Bradley K.
Abstract: Corporate America began to explore employees' child-care responsibilities approximately fifteen years ago, yet today less than 1 % of US companies offer some form of childcare assistance. One of the primary reasons cited for companies' general reluctance to embrace family-oriented benefits for employees is the lack of data demonstrating that these initiatives result in productivity gains. This article examines the work-family and productivity research undertaken to date and suggests that to understand how corporate family-responsive initiatives affect the work place it is necessary (a) to expand the inquiry from a narrow focus on corporate productivity or efficiency gains to a broader assessment of organizational effectiveness and (b) to frame the question within a corporate or organizational culture context. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Milliken, Frances J.
Abstract: The authors address the question of what factors influence the corporate response to work-and-family issues, using data from a written survey of companies. They hypothesized that various demographic, organizational, and other characteristics might affect the degree of a business's response. Among their findings are (1) that the percentage of female employees was unrelated to the responsiveness measure when other factors were controlled; (2) that industry and geographic effects were significant; and (3) that companies which regularly survey their employees tended to be more responsive. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges facing multibusiness corporations is to add value to the businesses that they own. Diversification by itself is no longer seen as a value to share-holders or to the businesses. This article presents a description of how a diverse corporation, Rockwell International, is trying to add value to its businesses. The corporate office and the Human Resources (HR) function are singled out for their roles in leading this effort at Rockwell.

Abstract: In today's business environment, human resource development (HRD) and organization development (OD) practitioners need to be experts at helping executives and managers deal with organizational change. This article presents survey research findings, based on responses from 357 HRD/OD practitioners, related to this critical area of expertise. The authors first describe the results of their research, and then conclude with implications of these results for HR and related professionals. Overall, HRD/OD practitioners were found to be quite knowledgeable about managing organizational change, and were more likely to describe their work style as transformational rather than transactional. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Helping top management avoid failure during planned change
Author-Name: Nutt, Paul C.
Abstract: Managers use a variety of tactics to set directions, to identify ideas, and to implement plans during planned change. Some of these tactics were found to be quite successful, and others have high rates of failure. Failure stemmed from imposing ideas, adopting ideas after a limited search, and using power to implement plans. Managers were far more successful when objectives were set and the need for action made clear at the outset, when an unrestricted search for ideas was carried out, and when participation was used to entice people to go along with the planned change. Suggestions to improve practice are offered as steps to take and steps to avoid during planned change. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: McFarlin, Dean B.

Author-Name: Cotton, John L.
Abstract: This article examines an American multinational company to uncover any crossnational differences in managerial attitudes toward employee participation in decision-making. Human resource practices of the parent company toward its European subsidiaries were also examined, especially those relevant to employee participation issues. Data were collected from the company's manufacturing facilities in Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States. Managers were interviewed and then surveyed regarding their attitudes toward participation. The interviews revealed resistance to the parent company's efforts to “export” an American vision of employee participation to its European subsidiaries. The survey data revealed attitudinal differences among European managers as well as among their American counterparts. Possible explanations, implications for human resource executives and research directions are discussed. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

A process is described that assesses what leaders or leadership teams mean when they say they want to change the culture of their organization, what benefits they expect to accrue from the desired cultural change, what action steps they will take to achieve the desired cultural change, and how evaluation can be carried out to assess whether culture change has actually been achieved. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Union–management interface: Using the competing values framework as a diagnostic tool to bring increased involvement at the plant level
Author-Name: McGraw, Rodney B.
Abstract: This article describes an organizational intervention jointly sponsored by the United Automobile Workers and the Ford Employee Involvement Executive Committee. The intervention was needed to rejuvenate the existing employee involvement (EI) process which had been in existence since the early 1980s. The EI process had achieved its purpose of making significant cultural changes at Ford, but was viewed as narrow in scope in light of existing organizational problems of quality, customer focus, and productivity. An organizational intervention was designed jointly by a committee of union and management personnel using the Competing Values Framework as a diagnostic tool to examine the current organizational gaps in the majority of Ford's manufacturing facilities. The article discusses the overall process and the significant results at four major plant facilities. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The competing values framework for management training and development: A tool for understanding complex issues and tasks
Author-Name: Sendelbach, Neil B.
Abstract: The Competing Values Framework (CVF) can be an effective tool in a business setting for management training and development. Ford Motor Company, in partnership with the University of Michigan, has developed learning activities for management training and development programs utilizing the CVF as a common construct for examining different complex issues and processes. This article describes six such activities and gives examples of associated outcomes. The context of application of the activities ranges from an analysis of corporate culture shifts to individual management performance feedback. The activities demonstrate the strength of the CVF as both a holistic tool requiring consideration of the dilemmas and paradoxes inherent in today's business environment and as a means for gaining a manageable perspective of complex situations. The CVF is shown not to be prescriptive but rather as descriptive in a manner that allows sense-making in today's chaotic and continuously changing environment. The activities also illustrate effective learning processes for engaging a mixture of participants from many different functional areas of the company in a common experience which then requires them to define their own conclusions and deivlop personal action plans applicable to their specific job responsibility. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Competing values instruments for analyzing written and spoken management messages
Author-Name: Rogers, Priscilla S.
Author-Name: Hildebrandt, Herbert W.
Abstract: This article revieios research leading to a Competing Values Model for Management Communication and provides instruments for evaluating managerial writing and speaking based on that model. Developed through empirical research by Quinn, Hildebrandt, Rogers, and Thompson (1991), the Competing Values Model for Communication illustrates the interplay between contrasting qualities in management messages. Instruments based on this model allow users to analyze the extent to which these qualities characterize their written and spoken presentations. By collecting analytical data from superiors, subordinates, and peers, a manager may compare his/her self-assessment with the assessments of others. Methods for interpreting the data include suggestions for developing action plans. The article concludes with a discussion of other potential applications of the instruments to communication research and pedagogy in managerial contexts. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Faerman, Sue R.
Abstract: This article explores the use of the Competing Values Framework of Organizational Effectiveness and of Managerial Leadership as a tool for helping organizational members better understand the similarities and differences of managerial leadership roles at various levels of hierarchy. Based on a series of interviews, similarities and differences between managerial roles at different levels of organizational hierarchy are examined. Three organizational interventions are described which use the Competing Values Framework in order to increase managers' communication and understanding across levels. These interventions focus on management education and development, performance appraisal, and team building across levels of hierarchy.

Title: Implications of the competing values framework for management information systems
Author-Name: Cooper, Randolph B.
Author-Name: Quinn, Robert E.
Abstract: Problems with evaluating management information systems' (MIS) effectiveness are due to the lack of an MIS effectiveness theory. This article draws on the Competing Values Framework to develop a framework of MIS effectiveness which links MIS characteristics to organizational effectiveness via management activity support. This framework is based in both organizational and MIS literatures and is corroborated by cognitive maps of recognized MIS experts. The framework is then used to gain a better understanding of the MIS effectiveness construct and thus to provide guidance for evaluating MIS effectiveness. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Perceptions or reality: Is multi‐perspective measurement a means or an end?
Author-Name: Tornow, Walter W.
Abstract: This article takes an epistemological perspective on “perceptions or reality” when examining multi-rater assessment measures as means versus ends and contrasts the scientist's and practitioner's perspectives. Multiple ratings—when used to map differences as well as similarities in perceptions about common reference points—can be powerful tools for individual or organizational development applications. The application of measurement tools for development purposes is quite different from the psychometric focus of measurement, however. In the latter, measurement becomes an end in itself; in the former, it is more a means to an end. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Understanding self‐perception accuracy: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Yammarino, Francis J.
Author-Name: Atwater, Leanne E.
Abstract: A conceptual model of self-perception accuracy is developed, and its managerial and research implications for human resources management are discussed. The model is based on a series of studies designed to enhance understanding of self–other agreement and the accuracy of self-perception. Accuracy is defined as the degree of agreement between self-and other-evaluations/ratings. In this framework, “other-ratings” may be provided by subordinates, peers, superiors, or customers/clients, so that self–other agreement includes the entire 360-degree range of feedback sources available to a focal individual. The evaluations/ratings may concern any of the key areas in personnel and human resource management such as training needs assessment, performance appraisal, or leadership behaviors. The model posits enhanced individual and organizational outcomes when self-perception is accurate and diminished or mixed outcomes when self-perception is inflated or deflated, respectively. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: An examination of the relationships among self‐perception accuracy, self‐awareness, gender, and leader effectiveness
Author-Name: Van Velsor, Ellen
Author-Name: Taylor, Sylvester
Author-Name: Leslie, Jean B.
Abstract: This article focuses on how membership in a self/rater agreement group (underraters, accurate raters, overraters) is related to self-ratings and others' ratings of self-awareness and leadership effectiveness. It also examines gender differences in the likelihood of self/rater agreement and in perceived self-awareness. Finally, the article examines agreement group and gender differences in terms of two components of self-awareness: knowledge of self and willingness to improve. Contrary to common belief, our research shows that women are not more likely to underrate their own skills on measures of leadership competency, and that gender differences do exist, both in rated self-awareness and in one of its subcomponents, knowledge of self. In addition, this research found underraters were rated highest in self-awareness by direct reports and highest in terms of overall leadership effectiveness. Managers who tend to overrate themselves compared to others' ratings were perceived as lowest of the three groups in both self-awareness and effectiveness. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Self–observer rating discrepancies: Once an overrater, always an overrater?
Author-Name: Nilsen, Dianne
Author-Name: Campbell, David P.
Abstract: Differences between the perceptions of self-raters and other observers are often found on 360-degree feedback instruments. This article reports on the nature of these self–observer differences. Specifically, self–observer discrepancies were found to be stable over time. In addition, discrepancies on skill-based multirater instruments were related to discrepancies on personality-based multirater instruments. This suggests that accuracy in self-perception is a stable individual difference. The implications for job performance and personality assessment are discussed. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: 360-degree Feedback is a popular fad. It relies on instruments designed to capture information from a variety of sources in the hope that the feedback from these sources can be best applied by the individual. While the idea of collecting information from a variety of relevant sources is commendable, the overall simplicity of the information collection process limits the usefulness of the information.

Title: 360‐degree feedback PLUS: Boosting the power of co‐worker ratings for executives
Author-Name: Kaplan, Robert E.
Abstract: As useful as co-worker ratings can be, all too often managers are given feedback and nothing changes. This is not surprising, since habits die hard. But, what if, to stand a better chance of having an impact, the power of co-worker ratings were boosted? This article describes several possible boosters: follow-through, using verbal descriptions along with ratings; collecting data on motivation as well as behavior; getting a historical perspective on the individual's current managerial behavior; and gathering data on the individual outside of work. A caveat: The more data that are collected and the greater the depth of these data, the greater the responsibility of those who conduct such an exercise. Feedback PLUS means commitment PLUS. This is all the more true when all the boosters are used in concert—an intervention the author and his colleagues have employed with executives. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: Three groups of supervisors who worked for a federal agency completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes toward subordinate appraisal and other aspects of performance appraisal. Group 1 received appraisal feedback from both their managers and their subordinates. Group 2 received feedback from their managers only. Group 3 received feedback about their performance from their subordinates only. Regardless of group assignment, supervisors were generally supportive of subordinate appraisal. Group 1 responded more positively to subordinate appraisal and the appraisal process in general. Group 3 expressed more concern that subordinate appraisals would undermine supervisors' authority and that supervisors would focus on pleasing subordinates. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The impact of 360‐degree feedback on management skills development
Author-Name: Hazucha, Joy Fisher
Author-Name: Hezlett, Sarah A.
Author-Name: Schneider, Robert J.
Abstract: This study investigated changes in the skill levels of managers which occurred two years following the managers' participation in 360-degree feedback. The major objective was to investigate how skill development, development efforts, and environmental support for development are related. The Management Skills Profile (MSP) was used to measure skills and to give feedback. Of the original 198 managers who received feedback, 48 accepted the opportunity to complete the instrument again two years later. At that time, they also completed a questionnaire surveying what development activities they had completed and the extent to which they received support for development from their supervisor and the organization. The first hypothesis was that, for the group, (a) participants' skills would increase following feedback, and (b) self–other agreement would be greater at Time 2 than at Time 1. This was supported. The second hypothesis was that management skills would be related to later advancement. This also was supported. The third hypothesis was that skill development would be related to both development efforts and environmental support, and that some development activities would be more effective than others. Hypothesis four was that those who put more effort into development (a) would have received at Time 1 ratings which were more favorable and more congruent with their self-ratings, and (b) would have received more environmental support. Hypotheses three and four were only partially supported. The results have implications for what managers can do to develop their skills and how others can support this development. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This article examines the status of 360-degree feedback in organizations. How to optimally use feedback from multiple constituencies as a competitive advantage is discussed. Differences between traditional performance appraisal and 360-degree feedback are elucidated. Elements of designing and implementing an effective 360-degree feedback program are explored: content, employee involvement, item type, format, relevance, implementation, using results for evaluation and/or development, including managers' self-assessment, and the form and content of the feedback. A research agenda on 360-degree programs is charted. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This article reviews salient features of the foregoing articles contained in this special issue of Human Resource Management. The 360-degree feedback movement constitutes an important new technology in the practice of human resource management. To be sure, these papers suggest a hodgepodge of techniques, testimonials, cautions, methodological problems, axes being ground, and a lack of overall cohesion. Even so, the net result is a good snapshot of the current status and hopeful future of this new technology. The net impact of these articles is significant, showing clearly that 360-degree feedback methodology possesses distinct promise for improved success in both individualized and group programs of personal development in the bureaucratic and organizational settings of the future. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Management commitment and company policies on education and training
Author-Name: Useem, Michael
Abstract: This article presents evidence from a 1991 survey of 406 large companies indicating that corporate education and training practices are shaped by four company characteristics: (1) human resource innovativeness, (2) management resistance to change, (3) work redesigns to enhance quality and involvement, and (4) firm downsizing. When managements create an innovative climate, their companies invest more in worker retraining and contribute more to public schooling; when they resist change, they find it more difficult to recruit entry-level employees. When managements redesign work, their companies place greater emphasis on training, development, and school relations. When managements downsize, their companies take more interest in entry-level training and apprenticeship programs. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Bringing mutual gains bargaining to labor negotiations: The role of trust, understanding, and control
Author-Name: Friedman, Raymond A.
Abstract: Mutual gains bargaining (MGB) is an approach to labor negotiations that has gained widespread popularity among consultants in recent years. Yet little is known about what factors affect negotiator support for MGB. In this article longitudinal survey data from three negotiations are examined to find out the degree to which trust, understanding, and control contribute to support for MGB. The results for labor and management negotiators are compared, as well as the findings before, during, and after negotiations. This exploratory study revealed several findings, including: (1) the one factor that is consistently most important is trust, (2) trust is more important to labor negotiators than it is to management negotiators, and (3) early in negotiations, understanding of the tactical implications of MGB (rather than of MGB “ideas”) is most important. These issues should be addressed during MGB training, and during broader, nontraining interventions into labor–management relations. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Sakakibara, Kiyonori
Author-Name: Kusunoki, Ken
Abstract: Until a few years ago, when compared to employees in countries of the Western World, Japanese employees entering an organization tended to have similar values and to stay in that organization rather than switching from one organization to another. That fact, however, has been changing. This article discusses the effects of this diversification of career orientations in young Japanese people. The main focus is on the effects of diversification on employment choice, the individual's decision-making as to which kind of employer to work for, and on the differing perceptions of management systems. © 1993 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This essay is a brief review of the evolution of work and human resource management, an evolution that parallels the development of civilization. Both continuity and change are apparent in the role of work in society and in its management. There has been continuity and change down through the centuries in motivation to work, in the sense of equity, and in how work is organized. For instance, early on much of work was self-service; it is moving in that direction again. Tradition and sentiment shaped the work organization. Gradually, tradition and sentiment were replaced by rationality. Currently, we see in the sociotechnical design of work the continuity as well as a coming together of both the rational and the socioemotional aspects of work in organizations. Looking at the past may help human resource managers to frame the issues involved and the expectations of future developments.

Title: When organizational relocation means family relocation: An emerging issue for strategic human resource management
Author-Name: Lawson, Marian B.
Abstract: Relocations of entire organizational units raise special family adjustment issues. This article reports on the reactions of employees and their families to such a relocation. Employees' adjustment was more strongly related to nonwork and family impacts of the move than to factors in the workplace. Adjustment was more difficult for families inexperienced in relocation, despite extensive company assistance programs.

Title: Human resource strategies and contingent workers: The case of safety and health in the petrochemical industry
Author-Name: Kochan, Thomas A.
Author-Name: Smith, Michal
Author-Name: Wells, John C.
Author-Name: Rebitzer, James B.
Abstract: One of the most important economic developments in recent years is the growth in the number of temporary and contract employees. Little is known, however, about the implications these contingent employees have for human resource practices. This paper presents the results of a study of one group of contingent workers, contract workers in the petrochemical industry. The primary concern of this study is the consequences contract workers have for safety, a hotly debated and politically charged issue in an industry where safety mishaps can have catastrophic consequences. We find that contract employees offer petrochemical firms an important degree of flexibility in meeting rapid fluctuations in their demand for labor. Contract employment relationships also create stresses with potentially severe adverse effects on workplace safety. Overcoming these threats to safety while maintaining flexibility will require a high level of coordination among human resource professionals, line managers, corporate executives, unions, and government agencies.

Title: Diverse approaches to managing diversity
Author-Name: Ellis, Catherine
Abstract: Against a backdrop of philosophical and political debate, this article reviews the emerging pitfalls of new corporate diversity programs. Three pioneering corporate programs are examined closely, and a discussion of the purpose, the process, and the impact of these programs is offered. Original survey data reported here suggest that exposure to diversity issues affects workplace attitudes. Lessons are drawn that address the role of top leadership, participant mix, instructor quality, and corporate culture.

Title: Outside director compensation and firm performance
Author-Name: Hempel, Paul
Author-Name: Fay, Charles
Abstract: Compensation given to outside directors has come under increasing scrutiny. However, little empirical work exists which examines outside director compensation. A study of more than 225 major corporations over a five-year period indicates that the number of board meetings and the size of the company are major factors in outside director compensation levels, while organization performance and Chief Executive Officer remuneration do not appear to be significantly related. These findings suggest that market-driven compensation systems are the dominant form used by large organizations to pay outside directors, with a major goal being the attraction and retention of these directors.

Title: Waiting for innovation in the human resources department: Godot implements a human resource information system
Author-Name: Kossek, Ellen Ernst
Author-Name: Young, Willard
Author-Name: Gash, Debra C.
Author-Name: Nichol, Victor
Abstract: The implementation of a new human resource information system (HRIS) represents a major form of planned organizational change for the Human Resource function, yet little research has been conducted on this issue. This article presents a longitudinal case study of the reactions of the Human Resource community in a large energy company to the planned implementation of a new corporate HRIS. Implementing an HRIS to enhance strategic and business decision-making has important organizational development implications. A new HRIS (1) represents an attempt to enable Human Resources to become more of a business partner, (2) changes the nature of HR work to encompass a greater information broker and decision support role, and (3) alters power dynamics and communication patterns involving Human Resources. Varying levels of resistance and ambivalence were found regarding the extent to which human resource information systems skills were valued as a critical competency. While there is a trend, toward attitudinal convergence within the human resource community, over time, the results suggest that user skill level may be more strongly related to variance in attitudes toward the value of a new HRIS than to hierarchical level or business unit affiliation. The study also found that face-to-face seminars were a significantly more effective intervention than was written communication in influencing favorable intention to use the HRIS.

Title: Strategies for successful organizational downsizing
Author-Name: Cameron, Kim S.
Abstract: This article reports the results of a study of 30 organizations that engaged in downsizing over a four-year period. Three questions were investigated: (1) What general strategies are used by organizations to downsize? (2) What are the effects of downsizing on organizational performance? (3) What are downsizing's “best practices?” or, What are the differences between organizations that effectively downsize and those that do not? Three main strategies for downsizing are explained, the managerial actions to overcome the negative effects of downsizing are enumerated, and the best practices of successful downsizing firms are presented.

Title: Organizational downsizing as convergence or reorientation: Implications for human resource management
Author-Name: Freeman, Sarah J.
Abstract: This article proposes that there are two basic approaches to organizational downsizing. Downsizing as reorientation is the proper approach when organizations undertake major downsizing programs. In this approach, many elements of the organization are questioned and changed simultaneously. The goal is a fundamentally different, not just smaller, organization. Downsizing as convergence is part of continuous improvement, and its goal is to refine and streamline all ongoing organizational processes. Each of these approaches to downsizing involves a particular pattern of downsizing tactics, implementation processes, and organizational changes. Thus, each approach to downsizing generates different implications for human resource management.

Title: Better practices in managing layoffs
Author-Name: Feldman, Daniel C.
Abstract: This article presents eight case studies that illustrate “better practices” in how layoffs are managed in organizations. These examples incorporate such policies and programs as early notification of layoffs, provisions for severance pay and extended benefits, education and retraining for displaced workers, outplacement assistance, clear and direct communication of layoff information, and support services for “survivors” of layoffs. These examples highlight the benefits of collaboration among downsizing businesses, public sector organizations, and unions in helping laid-off employees adjust to unemployment and obtain satisfactory reemployment.

Author-Name: Mishra, Aneil K.
Author-Name: Mishra, Karen E.
Abstract: Several factors that explain differences in the downsizing strategies utilized in organizations are examined in this study of 91 organizations in the automotive industry. Specifically, mutual trust within a top management team is positively associated with a strategy based on organization redesign. Mutual trust between members of an organization and its key customers and suppliers is positively associated with a strategy based on systemic change. Moreover, these two strategies are positively associated with performance outcomes in the areas of cost reduction and quality improvement.

Title: Relationships between self‐concepts, aspirations, emotional responses, and intent to leave a downsizing organization
Author-Name: Mone, Mark A.
Abstract: This study examines how individual-level factors, such as task self-confidence, self-esteem, personal goals, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment affect workers' decisions concerning intent to leave the downsizing organization. Results indicate that task self-confidence and role self-esteem had positive, largely direct effects on intent to leave, which can be contrasted with the inverse relationship between the self-concept and intent to leave typically found in non-downsizing organizations. From this investigation, several implications for managing human resources in the downsizing organization are drawn and discussed in the context of planning for downsizing, implementing downsizing, and managing the downsized organization.

Title: The new employment contract
Author-Name: Kissler, Gary D.
Abstract: From the turmoil of the last decade a new relationship has emerged between employees and their organizations. It is one that openly challenges many of the management assumptions behind the imbalance of power between the key participants. Making a successful adjustment to this change has enormous implications in terms of sustained competitive advantage based on the ability to access and retain a committed and skilled work force. Human Resource professionals will find themselves caught in competing loyalties as their roles in this change process evolve. This article offers insight into this changing contract and its impact on the business environment.

Title: Psychological contracts and change
Author-Name: Morrison, David E.
Abstract: The concept of psychological contracts is not new, but its popularity among managers is relatively recent. As with most interpersonal structures, we don't know we need it until it is gone. The massive amount of organizational change that took place in the 1980s left damaged relationships in its wake. Implementing changes while discounting human needs played havoc with psychological contracts. Organizations lost something they had taken for granted. As leaders realized they didn't just need more efficient processes and technology in order to compete, but also needed motivated people, psychological contracts became an important topic. Unfortunately the concept was often used as just another technique to try to force people to become what their leaders thought they should be. Psychological contracts aren't very useful for that kind of work. They are much better as a tool for understanding the human needs and problems in an organization—including the needs of the change agents and leaders.

Abstract: Practices used in recruiting, training, performance review, and compensation all contribute to employee beliefs in a psychological contract with their employer. This article presents the basic features of contract-making which human resource practices must manage. Organizations with multiple contract makers must align the messages they send to create a contract that works and can be kept. Recommendations are made for managing the psychological contract more effectively.

Author-Name: Parks, Judi McLean
Author-Name: Schmedemann, Deborah A.
Abstract: In this article, policy capturing was used to examine how lawyers, as experts, understand the wording in employee handbook passages that promise procedural protections for employees. Specifically, how the wording of employee handbook passages can create both legal and nonlegal obligations was examined. Forty-six lawyers were asked to make the following judgments: whether the handbook passage constituted a legal or moral obligation and the chances of the employer winning or being granted a summary judgment in a wrongful discharge suit. Five aspects of the handbook passages were examined: verb strength, specificity, contract disclaimers, legalistic jargon, and the employee's signature.

Title: Employee benefits: A growing source of psychological contract violations
Author-Name: Lucero, Margaret A.
Author-Name: Allen, Robert E.
Abstract: Since the 1940s, the number of employee benefits provided by employers and costs related to these benefits have increased dramatically. However, in the face of intensified product market competition, more and more organizations are decreasing their benefits packages as part of broader efforts to decrease labor costs. At the same time, many employees have become dependent on employer-provided benefits to help satisfy basic security needs. This article examines the evolution of this predicament and the associated consequences that are likely to arise as a result of this conflict between worker expectations and employer practices. Ideas for resolution of this employee–employer conflict are also discussed.

Author-Name: Noonan, Katherine A.
Abstract: This article examines the psychological contract and human resource practices as communications relevant to that contract. We argue that employees, at certain times only, systematically analyze their employers' HR practices for meaning vis-ri-vis their psychological contract. Judgments about the adequacy with which their psychological contracts are fulfilled result from such systematic analyses, and these judgments have important effects on employee commitment. Practical implications of our analysis are also discussed.

Author-Name: Wade‐Benzoni, Kimberly A.
Abstract: Organizations implement their business strategies through the human resource (HR) practices they use. These practices are major determinants of employees' psychological contracts. How employees interpret the terms of their employment impacts motivation, innovation, and customer service. This article describes four common types of psychological contracts in US firms and the HR practices that create them. It develops a framework for understanding how each contract shapes employee performance, retention, cooperation with fellow employees and customer responsiveness. It presents recommendations for more effectively managing the link between business strategy and the psychological contract of employees. © 1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Announced layoffs: Their effect on corporate financial performance

Author-Name: Bergmann, Thomas J.
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that when a firm gets into trouble due to lagging sales and rising costs, cutting the size of the organization to reduce fat and waste is a normal and effective response. In this study, evidence was found to suggest that just the opposite might be true. The financial performance of Fortune 100 companies was tracked over a five-year period—two years prior to the announced layoff, the year of the layoff announcement, and two years following it. Contrary to expectations, the results indicate that financial performance worsened, rather than improved, following announced layoffs. Strategic and human resource implications for the management of corporate downsizing are provided.

Title: A decade of change: Managers' attachment to their organizations and their jobs
Author-Name: Stroh, Linda K.
Author-Name: Brett, Jeanne M.
Abstract: In this study geographically mobile managers in 1978 were compared to mobile managers in 1989 and significant changes were found in career patterns and attachment to the organization and the job. The managers in 1989 were changing jobs and relocating more frequently than were the 1978 managers. They were also less satisfied with their companies. Job involvement and job satisfaction, however, were higher among the 1989 managers than among the 1978 managers. Retrospectively, the 1989 managers thought they were less loyal to their companies than they had been five years previously. Managers' attachment to their organizations may be tied to challenging jobs that provide career development opportunities; those organizations unwilling or unable to provide such jobs may experience higher managerial turnover.

Abstract: There is considerable evidence that women encounter a glass ceiling or barrier to advancement into the executive ranks of organizations. Although many expected this barrier to be obliterated with the large influx of women entering the work force over the last two decades, little change has actually occurred in the most senior ranks. In most sectors, women still comprise less than 5 percent of board directorships and corporate officerships.

Title: The transition into management by scientists and engineers: A misallocation or efficient use of human resources?
Author-Name: Roberts, Karen
Abstract: A theme in the career paths of scientists and engineers is their transition into management. This transition is described as difficult both for those who make it and for those who do not. This article uses Human Research Information System data from a large research & development firm to explore an alternative perspective in which the transition is seen as an efficient human resource promotion strategy. The results support the alternative explanation and indicate that the policy serves the firm well in allocating human resources. The results suggest that good technical employees tend to become good managers and that if coupled with aggressive training for those technical employees who do not move into management, the best workers stay with the firm.

Author-Name: Kopp, Rochelle
Abstract: This article presents the results of a survey comparing international human resource policies and practices in Japanese, European, and United States multinational companies. The survey focused on the use of expatriates over local nationals in overseas management positions, adoption of nonethnocentric policies, and incidence of international human resource management problems. Regression analysis using the entire sample indicated that ethnocentric staffing and policies are associated with higher incidence of international human resource management problems. Also, Japanese companies as a group are shown to have more ethnocentric staffing practices and policies, and they experience more international human resource management problems than do American and European firms.

Title: Why quality initiatives are failing: The need to address the foundation of human motivation
Abstract: Companies all over the United States have initiated quality programs in order to meet the demands of international competition. However well-intentioned, many of these initiatives have by and large met with failure. United States corporate leaders seem confused as to the causes of those failures. What business leadership has failed to realize is that there are certain underlying assumptions about human motivation in the workplace that must be addressed before any quality program can be successful. This article addresses those basic concerns and provides a framework for business leaders who embark on quality initiatives.

Title: Managing predecessors' shadows in executive transitions
Author-Name: Gilmore, Thomas North
Author-Name: Ronchi, Don
Abstract: New leaders inevitably face comparisons with predecessors. After a short time these comparisons usually give way to judgments about the leader's performance. Occasionally, however, the presence of the predecessor continues to be felt long after the new leader has taken charge. The metaphor of a “shadow” cast by a predecessor is used to describe the process whereby memories of a former leader play a dominant role in shaping current behavior in the organization. A case is analyzed in which a burdensome shadow impeded a new leader's efforts to take charge of a state agency. Counterprojective group techniques helped the new leader and his staff lift the shadow and form a more productive working relationship. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Communication in a power vacuum: Sense‐making and enactment during crisis‐induced departures
Author-Name: Theus, Kathryn T.
Abstract: Unanticipated departures of CEOs place demands upon interim leaders. From the literature a model is derived that illustrates problems of sense-making, enactment, communication, and organizational learning faced by these leaders and their internal and external stakeholders. A case, which focuses on the sudden resignation of the president of American University for making obscene phone calls to an area day-care worker, is used to illustrate the model. Comparisons are made in the corporate world with executive transitions at Kodak and American Express. Alternatives are suggested for improvements in communication and interim leadership when traumatic executive departures place severe and unfamiliar pressures on governance structures. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Not just understudies: The dynamics of short‐term leadership
Author-Name: Farquhar, Katherine W.
Abstract: Contrary to the stereotype that the period between CEOs is a hiatus, interim and acting executives serve during an important strategic window. A model is presented to illustrate the dynamics of short-term leadership, including the precipitating circumstances for the temporary administration, the tasks of short-term leadership, and the moderating factors seen to affect the selection and success of the next chief executive. Researchers and practitioners are urged to consider more carefully the potential that a well-managed interregnum has to repair damage from a traumatic departure, buffer between administrations, and prepare the organization to accept and work with new leadership. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Unplanned executive transitions and the dance of the subidentities
Author-Name: Hall, Douglas T.
Abstract: This is a study of a non-routine transition in an academic setting. After studying the processes of executive succession, succession planning, and executive development for many years, I found myself serving as Acting Dean of a school of management following the sudden resignation of the dean. This article is an account of my personal journey through that process, using subidentity theory as a way of understanding the experience. This article compares my own transition experiences with the theories of subidentity change and executive succession. It also identifies implications for future research based upon the differences observed, such as the perceived or virtual permanence of the acting administration. The conclusion offers recommendations for practice, such as the need for clarity of role expectations, strong leadership, and clear strategic direction; the value of a long hand-off process; and the utility of planned transition events. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Linking management selection and development through stretch assignments
Author-Name: McCauley, Cynthia D.
Author-Name: Eastman, Lorrina J.
Author-Name: Ohlott, Patricia J.
Abstract: This article provides a framework and suggests strategies for incorporating management development considerations into selection processes. Components of developmental jobs which were derived from studies of on-the-job learning are described first. How various managerial jobs differ in terms of developmental components and learning outcomes is illustrated with data from the Developmental Challenge Profile. Next, how the developmental challenge framework can be used in a selection context to assess the type and degree of “stretch” a job candidate might experience in an assignment is examined. Additional issues to consider in providing developmental assignments to individuals and in enhancing the development emphasis of succession planning systems are discussed. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: In search of a kingdom: Determinants of subsequent career outcomes for chief executives who are fired
Author-Name: Ward, Andrew
Author-Name: Sonnenfeld, Jeffrey A.
Author-Name: Kimberly, John R.
Abstract: Research on forced CEO succession has focused on determinants of exit, impact on the organization, or implications for the incoming CEO. Generally unexamined is what happens to the ousted CEO. Using a sample of 60 forced exits from the Business Week 1000 from 1988 to 1992, this study seeks to identify factors which influence the career outcomes for the ousted CEO. The study found that age matters—older CEOs were less likely to obtain other active executive positions, but were more likely than younger ousted CEOs to enter advisory roles. Further, the reason for the CEO's exit had a significant impact on the likelihood of subsequently assuming either an active or an advisory role. No relationship was found between career outcomes and the following: media coverage, levels of compensation at exit, board memberships. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Four ways to choose a CEO: Crown heir, horse race, coup d'Etat, and comprehensive search
Author-Name: Friedman, Stewart D.
Author-Name: Olk, Paul
Abstract: Most attempts to understand CEO succession fail to adequately differentiate the various ways by which CEOs are chosen. This article presents a conceptual framework that identifies four kinds of CEO succession processes, distinguished according to two key factors: political dynamics (who rules?) and the candidate search (are preferences known in advance?). Our main point is that the response of organizational stakeholders to CEO successions—(a) whether the process is perceived as fair, (b) whether the chosen successor is seen as good for an organization's future, and (c) the extent of disruption attending the leadership change—reflects how the politics and the search are managed. How internal and external stakeholders respond to a CEO succession can affect a new CEO's capacity for exercising effective leadership. Examples of each type (Apple, General Motors, Kodak, and Procter & Gamble) are offered and implications are drawn for researchers and for human resource executives. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Executives and shareholders: A shift in the relationship
Author-Name: Cannella, Albert A.
Abstract: This article suggests that a shift has developed in the ongoing relationship between executives and shareholders with shareholders gaining more power over executives. The power shift has been driven by institutional investors and hostile takeovers and is visible in changing patterns of succession. More executives are being dismissed for poor performance and are being dismissed more quickly following the onset of poor performance. Two potential negative outcomes are a decreased willingness of executives to undertake risky strategies and a decreased ability of executives to build long-term, trusting relationships with stakeholders, even when these actions would be beneficial to shareholders. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Executive succession as an antecedent to corporate restructuring
Author-Name: Wiersema, Margarethe F.
Abstract: One of the most visible adjustments in company strategies in recent years was the dramatic increase in the level of corporate restructuring activity that took place during the 1980s. Strategic decisions that result in the realignment of firms with their environments are likely to be influenced by the composition of the top management team. This study found that firms experiencing non-routine executive succession events within the management team subsequently underwent more restructuring activity than did firms without non-routine executive turnover. These findings suggest that unexpected executive turnovers can significantly alter managerial perspectives within top teams and may thus provide an important mechanism by which firms adapt to their competitive environments. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: A model and process for redesigning the HRM role, competencies, and work in a major multi‐national corporation
Author-Name: Kesler, Gregory C.
Abstract: This article presents a model and a detailed process for redesigning the human resources (HR) function by contracting with line executives for new roles and by upgrading the competencies of the human resource management staff while reengineering the HR delivery systems. The experience of a large, successful company that developed and implemented the process is described. The article argues that the use of “best practices” contributes less to creating a world-class human resource management team than to redefining the fundamental partnership role supported by the line organization. Partnering is defined in an operational manner using the HR grid. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This study of 115 subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies indicates that a majority had integrated HRM and strategic planning systems within their organizations. HRM issues were explicitly discussed in strategic plans; HRM executives were involved in the planning process as “strategic partners”; and HRM was generally recognized as playing an important role in implementing business strategies. The degree of integration present was not related to short-run firm performance, however, time lags may be a factor. Implications of these findings are drawn. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: From ideas to action: Creating a learning organization

Author-Name: León, Lu Stanton
Abstract: Discussions of learning organizations too often end up intangible and obscure. While organizational learning is easy to recognize, it is often difficult to describe and dissect. Here, emphasizing the pragmatic rather than the abstract, the authors offer a solid strategy for creating a learning organization. Their extensive research suggests that at least five elements are essential for companies to become learning organizations. Together, these elements provide a formula for creating a learning organization. By closely examining each element within that formula, managers can measure and increase the rate of learning within their organizations. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Human resource management innovations: Determinants of their adoption and implementation
Author-Name: Wolfe, Richard A.
Abstract: The benefits of innovation to many organizational functions are well documented. Very little research has addressed innovation within the HRM function, however. Given the importance of the HRM function to organizational competitiveness, successful HRM innovations (HRMIs) can be important determinants of organizational success. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to understanding HRMIs, and thus, to assist managers in making more informed decisions regarding their adoption and implementation. In order to do so this article: (1) describes and defines HRMIs; (2) reviews three studies of HRMI implementation; (3) develops a model of HRMI implementation; and (4) discusses research and practical implications of the HRMI model. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Author-Name: Ferner, Anthony

Author-Name: Sisson, Keith
Abstract: Much has been made of “networks” and corporate “culture” as sources of cohesion in increasingly loosely structured international firms. But how strong is the “corporate glue”? Using a case study of human resource management (HRM) in an international accounting firm, this article shows that growth and internationalization may themselves weaken the corporate glue, just as the need for global integration of activities increases. The resulting stresses lead to a greater emphasis on formal bureaucratic structures and processes, further calling into question the role of traditional culture. Alternative strategies for managing these tensions are proposed. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: How deficiencies in motivation to manage contribute to the United States' competitiveness problem (and what can be done about it)
Author-Name: Miner, John B.
Author-Name: Ebrahimi, Bahman
Author-Name: Wachtel, Jeffrey M.
Abstract: Data are presented to support the argument that motivation to manage is a major cause of managerial effectiveness, that it declined sharply in the college population during the activism of the 1960s and early 1970s, and that it is now severely lacking in the United States relative to many other countries. Thus America's competitiveness problems appear to be largely motivational in nature. Possible solutions are discussed, including recruiting and selecting for managerial motivation, increasing motivation to manage using training and development techniques, and changing organizational designs (telescoping the scalar chain, moving managerial tasks into non-managerial positions, resorting to professional forms, and expanding venture structures). © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: This study used a sample of 405 managers and their spouses from twenty Fortune 500 multinational corporations to document the availability of American managers for international assignments. Aside from their spouses' feelings about international relocation, managers' willingness to relocate internationally was also predicted by their own attitudes about moving in general and their willingness to relocate domestically. Implications for human resource policy suggest that corporations must increasingly focus on human resource policies targeted toward the spouse. Results suggested that monitoring managers' intentions to relocate will enhance the organization's ability to adequately staff international sites with experienced managers. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Performance management in a changing context: Monsanto pioneers a competency‐based, developmental approach
Author-Name: Jones, Thomas W.
Abstract: Because performance management systems fail in today's lean economic climate, the Monsanto Company developed the Performance Enhancement Process (PEP) to manage the context in which performance occurs, rather than the performance itself. PEP serves as a catalyst for organizational clarity and creates a tangible link between human resources and business. By implementing PEP, Monsanto decided to shift its emphasis from performance management to employee development, simplifying-goal setting and transforming the supervisor's role from evaluator to coach. To gauge PEP's effectiveness, the Company initiated a system of 360-degree feedback to monitor progress and to ensure continuous development. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Abstract: With data from 12,689 associates of human resource (HR) professionals in 1500 businesses in 109 firms, this research represents an extensive assessment of HR competencies. It extends current HR theory and practice in two ways. First, it proposes specific competencies HR professionals may demonstrate to add value to a business. Second, it offers an empirical assessment of how these competencies affect the performance of HR professionals as perceived by their Associates. The results indicate that when HR professionals demonstrate competencies in business knowledge, delivery of HR, and management of change, then HR professionals are perceived by their associates as more effective. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Which executive human resource management practices for the top management team are associated with higher firm performance?
Author-Name: Martell, Kathryn
Author-Name: Carroll, Stephen J.
Abstract: There is growing awareness of the importance and role of the top management team (TMT). Little is known about how this group of executives should be treated from a human resource management (HRM) perspective since most research and writing on human resource management practices have focused on lower level personnel.

Title: The impact of children on women managers' career behavior and organizational commitment
Author-Name: Korabik, Karen
Author-Name: Rosin, Hazel M.
Abstract: Having children has been assumed to reduce womens' organizational commitment and involvement in their work and increase their likelihood of turnover. This assumption was examined by comparing 169 women MBAs who had children with 191 who did not on the basis of their responses to a survey. After controlling for differences in age, experience and work status, results showed no differences in met expectations, turnover intentions, commitment, satisfaction, job characteristics, or perceptions of progress. However, women with children scored lower on job involvement and reported fewer work hours. While parenting demands may affect these variables, they may not necessarily affect work-related attitudes, professional attainment, attachment to the job, or commitment to the organization. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Developing leadership capabilities of global corporations: A comparative study in eight nations
Author-Name: Yeung, Arthur K.
Author-Name: Ready, Douglas A.
Abstract: Changing competitive dynamics are influencing the leadership capability requirements of global corporations. More than 1,200 managers from ten major global corporations in eight countries responded to an international survey on the core capabilities required for competitiveness. While the results highlighted six leadership capabilities that are globally valued, a comparative analysis of the data shows that culture affects the relative importance given to a leadership capability requirement. The article also investigates the most effective methods for developing each of the core leadership capabilities. Implications for HR professionals are suggested as they devise strategies for leadership development. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Strengthening the weak link in strategic executive development: Integrating individual development and global business strategy
Author-Name: Seibert, Kent W.
Author-Name: Hall, Douglas T.
Author-Name: Kram, Kathy E.
Abstract: The global business environment of the 1990s provides both challenge and opportunity to human resource development to become an integral player in helping implement business strategy. The results of two best practice studies suggest that some leading firms such as 3M and Motorola are doing just that. At these companies current strategic business issues are the drivers of flexible and opportunistic executive development activities. Naturally occurring on-the-job experiences are consciously utilized in such a way that helping executives to develop becomes an integral part of conducting business. The implications of linking executive development to business strategy for practice and for future research are discussed. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: 360 Feedback from Another Angle
Author-Name: Bracken, David W.
Author-Name: Timmreck, Carol W.

Author-Name: Summers, Lynn
Abstract: How do you know if a 360 process has been implemented successfully? What are the factors that influence its success? How can those factors be controlled by those responsible for its implementation? Despite its popularity, there has been little effort to build a comprehensive model that addresses these fundamental questions about 360 feedback. In a quest for such a model, we identify a host of key factors organized according to whether they exert their influence proximally or distally. We discuss how each factor contributes to successful implementation. After identifying how design features of a 360 process affect these key factors, we recommend how to enhance the probability of implementing 360 feedback successfully and sustaining the process over time. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Hold the Line: An Examination of Line vs. Staff Differences
Author-Name: Church, Allan H.
Author-Name: Waclawski, Janine
Abstract: Despite common perceptions about the differences between line and staff personnel, few studies have provided answers as to which group is more effective. This study explores in detail key differences in managerial strengths between 46 line managers and 52 staff professionals in one of the fastest growing, highly service-oriented retail organizations in the United States. Using behavioral data from a developmental multirater feedback effort, results suggest that staff personnel were more modest and accurate in their self-assessments, while line managers were more service-oriented but significantly weaker at relationships, openness to new ideas, demonstrating respect, and adaptability to change. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: The Implications of ADA Litigation for Employers: A Review of Federal Appellate Court Decisions
Author-Name: Lee, Barbara A.
Abstract: Analysis of litigation outcomes indicates that most plaintiffs who sue under the Americans with Disabilities Act are unsuccessful. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement data and six years of federal appellate court decisions were reviewed, as well as recent rulings of the United States Supreme Court. The courts are interpreting the ADA very narrowly, and very few plaintiffs prevail. The results of this research suggest that if employers engage in an individualized assessment of whether an individual is protected by the law and whether the requested accommodation is reasonable, legal liability will be minimized. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Managing Harassment
Author-Name: Bland, Timothy S.
Author-Name: Stalcup, Sue S.
Abstract: Survey says: Sexual harassment complaints went up about 10% each year between 1995 and 1998! And even worse, 2 out of 3 complaints had some merit! Clearly, organizations need to learn how to manage this issue, not just be compliant with the law. This article provides interpretations of recent Supreme Court decisions for HR practitioners and new methods for managing harassment in workplaces. It may stimulate those who are reading the article to “step outside the box” and be more innovative in their approach to managing harassment in their organizations so as to create self-sustaining environments where harassment is unwelcome. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Managing Individual Performance in Work Groups
Author-Name: Liden, Robert C.
Author-Name: Wayne, Sandy J.
Author-Name: Kraimer, Maria L.
Abstract: This research was driven by the question, “In empowered work groups, who should be responsible for determining disciplinary actions in response to group member poor performance: the formal manager, a single group member, or the group as a whole?” Results in a study of 231 group members representing 41 groups from four diverse organizations showed that the severity of disciplinary actions made by formal managers is equivalent to actions taken by groups through consensus decision-making. Selecting one member of the group, however, to handle a poorly performing member resulted in relatively lenient disciplinary actions. Consistent with this finding, the attitude survey results revealed that individual group members are reluctant to assume responsibility for disciplining a poorly performing group member. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Title: Team Rewards: How Far Have We Come?
Author-Name: McClurg, Lucy Newton
Abstract: Although many organizations find teams to be important to their success, few have implemented reward systems that encourage team effort. This study examines the practices of 35 firms using team-based reward programs and identifies some features of these programs that improve their effectiveness. The results indicate that the most valued programs were those associated with (1) high levels of communication to employees about the specifics of the plan, (2) strong worker involvement in the plan's design and implementation, and (3) team members' perceptions that the pay system was fair. HR managers considered more complex plans more beneficial than simple plans. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
