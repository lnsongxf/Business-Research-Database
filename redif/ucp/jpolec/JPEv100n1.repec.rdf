Title:   Does School Quality Matter? Returns to Education and the Characteristics of Public Schools in the United States. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-40
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper estimates the effects of school quality--measured by the
 pupil/teacher ratio, average term length, and relative teacher pay--on the
 rate of return to education for men born between 1920 and 1949. Using
 earnings data from the 1980 census, the authors find that men who were
 educated in states with higher-quality schools have a higher return to
 additional years of schooling. Rates of return are also higher for
 individuals from states with better-educated teachers and with a higher
 fraction of female teachers. Holding constant school quality measures,
 however, the authors find no evidence that parental income or education
 affects average state-level rates of return.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Role of Unemployment Insurance in an Economy with Liquidity Constraints and Moral Hazard. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 118-42
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The potential welfare benefits of unemployment insurance, along with the
 optimal replacement ratio, are studied using a quantitative dynamic
 general equilibrium model. To provide a role for unemployment insurance,
 agents in the authors' economy face exogenous idiosyncratic employment
 shocks and are unable to borrow or insure themselves through private
 markets. In the absence of moral hazard, replacement ratios as high as
 0.65 are optimal and the welfare benefits of unemployment insurance are
 quite large. However, if there is moral hazard and the replacement ratio
 is not set optimally, the economy can be much worse-off than it would be
 without unemployment insurance.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Money and Prices in Colonial America: A New Test of Competing Theories. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 143-61
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  In a long-standing controversy over monetary experiences in colonial
 America, the main substantive issue concerns large and rapid increases in
 stocks of paper currency that were followed by negligible changes in price
 levels. The "backing theory" or anticlassical interpretation is that
 prices failed to respond to major increases in total money supplies. The
 "quantity theory" or classical hypothesis, by contrast, is that specie was
 exported in amounts that left total money stocks approximately unchanged.
 This paper develops and applies a strategy for resolving this fundamental
 disagreement despite the absence of data on stocks and flows of specie.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Measurable Dynamic Gains from Trade. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 162-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Productive factors, such as human and physical capital, accumulate and
 trade policy can affect their steady-state levels. Consequently, in
 addition to the usual static effects, trade liberalization has dynamic
 effects on output and welfare as the economy moves to its new steady
 state. The output impact of this dynamic effect is also measurable. The
 size of this dynamic gain from trade depends on the wedge between social
 and private returns to capital. Rough numerical estimates of the output
 and welfare effects are provided.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Determinants of Pesticide Regulation: A Statistical Analysis of EPA Decision Making. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 175-97
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the EPA's decision to cancel or continue the
 registration of cancer-causing pesticides that went through the special
 review process between 1975 and 1989. Despite claims to the contrary, the
 authors' analysis indicates that the EPA indeed balanced risks to health
 and the environment against benefits in regulating pesticides.
 Intervention by special interest groups was also important in the
 regulatory process. The authors' analysis suggests that the EPA is capable
 of weighing benefits and costs when regulating environmental hazards;
 however, the implicit value placed on health risks--$35 million per
 applicator cancer case avoided--may be considered high by some persons.

Title:   International Trade with Lumpy Countries. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 198-210
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper explores the implications for the pattern of international
 trade of differences among regions within countries--what the authors call
 "lumpiness." If factors of production are sufficiently unevenly
 distributed across regions, then the pattern of trade of the country as a
 whole may depart from what it would have been had factors been evenly
 distributed. Thus, lumpiness in the geographical distribution of factors
 can be a determinant of trade. The authors show in particular that if
 other determinants of trade are absent, then a country will tend to export
 the good that intensively uses its lumpier (i.e., more unevenly
 distributed) factor.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sequential Banking. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 41-61
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors study environments in which agents may borrow sequentially
 from more than one leader. Although debt is prioritized, additional
 lending imposes an externality on prior debt because, with moral hazard,
 the probability of repayment of prior loans decreases. Equilibrium
 interest rates are higher than they would be if borrowers could commit to
 borrow from at most one bank. Even though the loan terms are less
 favorable than they would be under commitment, the indebtedness of
 borrowers is greater. Further, additional lending causes the probability
 of default to increase. The results apply to markets for consumer,
 corporate, and international debt.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Franklin D. Roosevelt, Silver, and China. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 62-83
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The silver purchase program, initiated by Franklin Roosevelt in late 1933
 in response to the economically small but politically potent silver bloc,
 gave a large short-run subsidy to silver producers at the cost of
 destroying any long-run monetary role for silver. More important, it
 imposed severe deflation on China, the only major country still on a
 silver standard, and forced it off the silver standard and on to a fiat
 standard, which brought forward in time and increased in severity the
 subsequent wartime inflation and postwar hyperinflation. The silver
 purchase program thereby contributed, though perhaps only modestly, to the
 ultimate triumph of the Communists.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Trade-Off between Child Quantity and Quality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 84-117
Issue: 1
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  An empirical investigation of trade-offs between number of children and
 their scholastic performance confirms that family size directly affects
 children's achievement. Though parents show no favoritism to first-born
 children, being early in the birth order implies a distinct advantage,
 entirely because of the higher probability of being in a small family.
 Recent large changes in family size explain a portion of aggregate test
 score declines, but increased divorce rates and market work by mothers
 have no apparent impact. Finally, teachers are shown to differ enormously,
 even though performance differences are poorly captured by commonly
 measured teacher characteristics.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
