Title:   Convergence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 223-51
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A key economic issue is whether poor countries or regions tend to grow
 faster than rich ones: are there automatic forces that lead to convergence
 over time in the levels of per capita income and product? The authors use
 the neoclassical growth model as a framework to study convergence across
 the forty-eight contiguous U.S. states. They exploit data on personal
 income since 1840 and on gross state product since 1963. The U.S. states
 provide clear evidence of convergence, but the findings can be reconciled
 quantitatively with the neoclassical model only if diminishing returns to
 capital set in very slowly.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Insiders, Outsiders, and Nominal Wage Contracts. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 252-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  While the consequences of nominal wage contracts have been rather
 thoroughly analyzed, there is no generally accepted theory of why such
 contracts prevail. In this paper, the author argues that the distinction
 between insiders and outsiders is important for understanding nominal wage
 contracts. Since most employment fluctuations take the form of
 fluctuations in hiring, insiders are normally not affected by them. Since
 prices are primarily determined by costs, demand shocks have small effects
 on real wages. Thus, insiders have little incentive to change to more
 complicated contracts. With rigid nominal wages, nominal demand shocks
 have large effects on the employment opportunities of outsiders.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sacrifice and Stigma: Reducing Free-Riding in Cults, Communes, and Other Collectives.

Abstract:
  This paper presents an economic analysis of religious behavior that
 accounts for the continuing success of groups with strange requirements
 and seemingly inefficient prohibitions. The analysis does not presuppose
 any special motives for religious activity. Rather, religion is modeled as
 a club good that displays positive returns to "participatory crowding."
 The analysis demonstrates that efficient religions with perfectly rational
 members may benefit from stigma, self-sacrifice, and bizarre behavioral
 restrictions. The model also addresses sacrifice in nonreligious "social
 clubs": fraternities, communes, political parties, work groups, and
 families.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   History's Role in Coordinating Decentralized Allocation Decisions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 292-316
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  What causes individual suppliers to allocate goods in such a way that the
 aggregate allocation satisfies the law of one price? A satisfactory answer
 to this question must confront two related problems: equal net prices at
 all allocations provide no information to suppliers about the quantity to
 deliver to a specific location and strategic uncertainty makes an observed
 violation of the law of one price an unreliable indicator of a profit
 opportunity. This paper develops a simple analytical framework to
 formalize these two problems, reviews some solutions found in the
 literature, and reports laboratory evidence on how people solve them.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Testing Financial Market Equilibrium under Asymmetric Information. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 317-48
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors devise tests that distinguish between competitive
 (Walrasian), fully revealing rational expectations and noisy rational
 expectations equilibria based on their predictions concerning trading
 volume around public information signals. Empirical results strongly
 support the noisy rational expectations hypothesis. This indicates that a
 significant amount of noise exists (so that private information has
 value), but not enough to obfuscate entirely the information content of
 price. The authors' analysis also indicates that the dispersion of private
 information across traders has an impact on trading volume, but not on
 price.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Behavior of Prices and Inflation: An Empirical Analysis of Disaggregated Price Data. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 349-89
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the effects of inflation on the dispersion of prices,
 and other aspects of price behavior, using disaggregated data on prices of
 foodstuffs in Israel during 1978-84. The authors find that expected
 inflation has a stronger effect on intramarket price variability than
 unexpected inflation. They show that even in times of high inflation price
 quotations are not trivially short and that price changes are not
 synchronized across firms. These facts, taken together, confirm that there
 is some staggering in the setting of prices. The authors find that the
 distribution of real prices is not uniform as many menu cost-based models
 assume or conclude.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A General Equilibrium Model of Housing, Taxes, and Portfolio Choice. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 390-429
Issue: 2
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors describe a model in which rental and owner housing are risky
 assets, tenure choice is endogenous, and each household is constrained to
 consume the same amount of owner housing that it has in its investment
 portfolio. Equilibrium net rates of return are major determinants of the
 amount of owner housing, but a logit model indicates that demographic
 factors are the main determinants of ownership rates. In their simulation,
 taxes on owner housing would raise welfare not only by reallocating
 capital but also by the government's taking part of the risk from
 individual properties and diversifying it away.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
