Title:   Collective Labor Supply and Welfare. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 437-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a general, "collective" model of household labor
 supply in which agents are characterized by their own (possibly
 altruistic) preferences and household decisions are only assumed to be
 Pareto efficient. An alternative interpretation is that there are two
 stages in the internal decision process: agents first share nonlabor
 income, according to some given sharing rule; then each one optimally
 chooses his or her own labor supply and consumption. This setting is shown
 to generate testable restrictions on labor supplies. Moreover, the
 observation of labor-supply behavior is sufficient for recovering
 individual preferences and the sharing rule (up to a constant).  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Incentive Contracts in the Presence of Career Concerns: Theory and Evidence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 468-505
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies optimal incentive contracts when workers have career
 concerns--concerns about the effects of current performance on future
 compensation. The authors show that the optimal compensation contract
 optimizes total incentives: the combination of the implicit incentives
 from career concerns and the explicit incentives from the compensation
 contract. Thus, the explicit incentives from the optimal compensation
 contract should be strongest for workers close to retirement because
 career concerns are weakest for these workers. The authors find empirical
 support for this prediction in the relation between chief-executive
 compensation and stock-market performance.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Internal Net Worth and the Investment Process: An Application to U.S. Agriculture. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 506-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Recent models of firm investment decisions stressing informational
 imperfections in capital markets provide a foundation for interpreting
 evidence that movements in internal finance can predict investment
 spending, even after one controls for measures of firms' investment
 opportunities. While such evidence is suggestive, it is often open to
 other interpretations. The authors examine these models using data on
 equipment investment in the U.S. agricultural sector. This sector is
 particularly interesting because it has experienced large fluctuations in
 net worth and the profitability of investment, and reasonable measures of
 net worth can be constructed.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Determinants of Black-White Differences in Early Employment Careers: Search, Layoffs, Quits, and Endogenous Wage Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 535-60
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the transition from school to full-time employment and
 subsequent labor mobility during the first five postschooling years for
 several recent cohorts of black and white male "terminal" high school
 graduates using unique data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National
 Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience. A constrained
 optimization model of labor-force dynamics is implemented, empirically
 integrating features of models previously described in the literature. The
 estimates of the model provide quantitative evidence on underlying
 structural differences in labor-market constraints faced by blacks and
 whites.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Social Efficiency of Private Decisions to Enforce Property Rights. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 561-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Costs must be incurred if an owner is to enforce private property rights
 effectively. The authors show that, in a perfectly competitive economy,
 private decisions to enforce rights may result in either more or less
 enforcement than is socially efficient. Cases of multiple stable
 equilibria occur and an equilibrium may be locally, but not globally,
 efficient. Resources may not be employed in their socially most valuable
 uses and enforcement may be accompanied by inefficient investment in
 resource productivity.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Time Dynamics and Incomplete Information in the Private Provision of Public Goods. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 581-97
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In this paper, a dynamic model of the provision of a public good with
 incomplete information is developed. For a finite population, in addition
 to the standard underprovision type of results, inefficiency occurs
 because of a delay in contributions. For an infinite population, although
 delay may disappear, underprovision remains so that equilibrium is still
 inefficient. Policy implications of these results are described, emphasis
 being put on possible government intervention with incomplete information.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Incentive Contracts and Performance Measurement. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 598-614
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the characteristics of incentive contracts in which
 the agent's payoff is not based on the principal's objective.	The author
 shows that contracts based on such performance measures will not, in
 general, provide first-best incentives, even when the agent is risk
 neutral. The form of the optimal contract and the efficiency of this
 contract depend on the relationship between the performance measure used
 and the principal's objective. The model provides a simple and intuitive
 statistical measure. Applications to various incentive contracting
 situations, including the "gaming" of performance measures, the use of
 revenue-based sales commissions, and relative performance evaluation, are
 presented.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Endogenous Market Participation and the General Equilibrium Value of Money. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 615-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors study the monetary theory implications of fixed costs
 associated with trade in private assets. The authors show that with
 heterogeneous endowment profiles it is possible for an endogenous subset
 of agents to hold currency even when it is dominated in return by a
 competing asset. With respect to positive issues in monetary theory, the
 model implies that changes in the steady-state growth rate of the money
 supply have a negative effect on real interest rates because of endogenous
 market participation measures. On the normative side, the authors show
 that there may be an equity-efficiency trade-off from monetary deflation.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Are Contributions Rational? Untangling Strategies of Political Action Committees. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 647-64
Issue: 3
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Empirical public choice literature and casual observation suggest that
 the behavior of political action committees is remarkably unsophisticated,
 meaning that political action committees give to those legislators who
 would support their interests anyway. Thus, it is suggested that
 contributor behavior deviates from rational behavior, which is a
 cornerstone of economic analysis. In this paper, a switching regression
 model is estimated that allows for strategies of political action
 committees to vary for different contribution recipients. The author
 analyzes the behavior of farm political action committees over three
 election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, he finds that
 contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
