Title:   Economic Crisis in a Shortage Economy. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 673-90
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  It is not unusual for reforming socialist economies to relax wage
 controls without hardening budget constraints on enterprises or freeing
 consumer goods prices. This policy can be dangerously destabilizing. While
 higher wages permit workers to purchase more of some goods, they also tend
 to exacerbate shortages and to breed waste and corruption. Beyond a
 certain level, economywide wage hikes will worsen worker welfare,
 regardless of whether deficit goods are strictly rationed, sold randomly
 at official prices to queuing workers, or offered to workers by "insiders"
 only at black-market prices. However, the form of allocation does
 influence the levels of output and welfare.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Quadratic Social Welfare Functions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 691-712
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  John Harsanyi has provided an intriguing argument that social welfare can
 be expressed as a weighted sum of individual utilities. His theorem has
 been criticized on the grounds that a central axiom, that social
 preference satisfies the independence axiom, has the morally unacceptable
 implication that the process of choice and considerations of ex ante
 fairness are of no importance. This paper presents a variation of
 Harsanyi's theorem in which the axioms are compatible with a concern for
 ex ante fairness. The implied mathematical form for social welfare is a
 strictly quasi-concave and quadratic function of individual utilities.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Fiscal Policy, Specialization, and Trade in the Two-Sector Model: The Return of Ricardo? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 713-44
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a two-sector neoclassical model of international
 trade with endogenous capital accumulation and intertemporal optimization.
 In contrast to the traditional "2 x 2" model, there is a Ricardian
 implication that countries specialize according to comparative advantage.
 Consequently, the theory predicts that government expenditure policies are
 unlikely to affect the established pattern of specialization and trade,
 but that changes in tax policies can result in a dramatic reorganization
 of world production. Further, the dynamic 2 x 2 x 2 model can explain many
 of the salient features of international trade that are problematic for
 the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   International Real Business Cycles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 745-75
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors ask whether a two-country business cycle model can account
 simultaneously for domestic and international aspects of business cycles.
 With this question in mind, the authors document a number of discrepancies
 between theory and data. The most striking discrepancy concerns the
 correlations of consumption and output across countries. In this data,
 outputs are generally more highly correlated across countries than
 consumptions. In the model they see the opposite.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Interest Rate Control and Nonconvergence to Rational Expectations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 776-800
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Under general conditions, a monetary policy of pegging the nominal rate
 of interest will make it possible for any adaptive learning mechanism that
 satisfies a weak and plausible condition to converge to rational
 expectations. Instead, under such a policy an economy will undergo a
 cumulative process of the sort described.by Milton Friedman. This is shown
 in a micro-based finance constraint model as well as an IS-LM model. The
 same result applies also to more flexible policies of interest control and
 suggests a severe limitation to rational expectations analyses that ignore
 the issue of expectational stability.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Peer Pressure and Partnerships. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 801-17
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Partnerships and profit sharing are often claimed to motivate workers by
 giving them a share of the pie. But in organizations of any significant
 size, the free-rider effects would seem to choke off any motivational
 forces. This analysis explores how peer pressure operates and how factors
 such as profit sharing, shame, guilt, norms, mutual monitoring, and
 empathy interact to create incentives in the firm. The argument that
 Japanese firms enjoy team spirit because compensation is linked to overall
 profitability is analyzed. An explanation for the prevalence of
 partnerships among individuals in similar occupations is provided.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Public versus Private Investment in Human Capital Endogenous Growth and Income Inequality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 818-34
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors present an overlapping generations model with
 heterogeneous agents in which human capital investment through formal
 schooling is the engine of growth. The authors use simple functional forms
 for preferences, technologies, and income distribution to highlight the
 distinction between economies with public education and those with private
 education. The authors find that income inequality declines more quickly
 under public education. On the other hand, private education yields
 greater per capita incomes unless the initial income inequality is
 sufficiently high. The authors also find that societies will choose public
 education if a majority of agents have incomes below average.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Compensating Wage Differentials and Unobserved Productivity. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 835-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  It is well known that the inability to observe workers' full labor market
 productivity can bias estimates of compensating wage differentials. This
 paper attempts to determine how serious this bias is likely to be. It
 adopts a stochastic framework or workers' tastes over job attributes and
 models their equilibrium wage-job attribute choices. Workers' productivity
 is assumed to consist of observed and unobserved components. Applying the
 standard estimation methodology, the authors find that the degree of bias
 can be surprisingly large. On the basis of their analysis, they conclude
 that contemporary labor market studies are likely to severely
 underestimate workers' willingness to pay for job attributes.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Insider Trading: Should It Be Prohibited? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 859-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Insider trading moves forward the resolution of uncertainty. Using a
 rational expectations model with endogenous investment level, the author
 shows that, when insider trading is permitted, (1) stock prices better
 reflect information and will be higher on average, (2) expected real
 investment will rise, (3) markets are less liquid, (4) owners of
 investment projects and insiders will benefit, and (5) outside investors
 and liquidity traders will hurt. Total welfare may increase or decrease
 depending on the economic environment. Factors that favor the prohibition
 of insider trading are identified.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
