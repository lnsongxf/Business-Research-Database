Title:   Engel's Law and Cointegration. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1027-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  A time-series counterpart of Engel's law is that the expenditure share on
 food declines as the economy grows. The main purpose of this paper is to
 test whether Houthakker's addilog utility function can simultaneously
 explain this time-series observation and cross-sectional observations
 concerning Engel's law. Masao Ogaki and Joon Y. Park's cointegration
 approach is used to estimate parameters of the utility function from
 time-series data. Total expenditure elasticities implied.by the estimated
 addilog utility function are compared with estimates of the elasticities
 from cross-sectional data.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Some Evidence on the Empirical Significance of Credit Rationing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1047-77
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the credit rationing debate using detailed contract
 information on over one million commercial bank loans from 1977 to 1988.
 While commercial loan rates are "sticky," consistent with rationing, this
 stickiness varies with loan contract terms in ways that are not predicted
 by equilibrium credit rationing theory. In addition, the proportion of new
 loans issued under commitment does not increase significantly when credit
 markets are tight, despite the fact that borrowers without commitments can
 be rationed whereas commitment borrowers are contractually insulated from
 rationing. Overall, the data suggest that equilibrium rationing is not a
 significant macroeconomic phenomenon.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sanctions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 899-928
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Sanctions are measures that one party (the sender) uses to influence
 another (the target). Sanctions, or the threat of sanctions, have been
 used by governments to alter the human rights, trade, or foreign policies
 of other governments. The authors develop notions of the sender's and
 target's toughness that depend on their patience and on the extent of
 their suffering from sanctions. How much a sender can exact from the
 target depends on the relative toughness of the two. Sanctions that impose
 less harm on the target can sometimes be more effective than those that
 impose greater harm.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competition in the British Electricity Spot Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 929-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Most of the British electricity supply industry has been privatized. Two
 dominant generators supply bulk electricity to an unregulated "pool." They
 submit a supply schedule of prices for generation and receive the
 market-clearing price, which varies with demand. Despite claims that this
 should be highly competitive, the authors show that the Nash equilibrium
 in supply schedules implies a high markup on marginal cost and substantial
 deadweight losses. Further simulations, to show the effect of entry by
 1994, produce somewhat lower prices at the cost of excessive entry;
 subdividing the generators into five firms would produce better results.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Price Discrimination in Competitive Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 954-65
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors present models in which price discrimination in the context
 of a two-part price can occur in some competitive markets. Purchases take
 place in groups, which choose which firms to patronize. While firms are
 perfectly competitive with respect to groups, they have some market power
 over individual consumers, who are constrained by their group's choices.
 The authors find that firms will charge an entry fee that is below
 marginal cost and the second part of the price is marked up above marginal
 cost. The markup not only is positive but increases with the quality of
 the product.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Measuring Peer Group Effects: A Study of Teenage Behavior. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 966-91
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Individuals or households often have some scope for choice of peer
 groups, whether through the selection of neighborhood of residence,
 school, or friends. This study addresses the estimation of peer group
 effects in cases in which measures of peer group influence are potentially
 endogenous variables. Using a rich data set on individual behavior, the
 paper explores teenage pregnancy and school dropout behavior. For both
 cases, the estimation of a straightforward single-equation model yields
 statistically significant peer group effects; however, these effects
 disappear under simultaneous equation estimation. The results are robust
 and suggest the need for careful modeling of the choice of peer groups.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change in Informational Cascades. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 992-1026
Issue: 5
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  An informational cascade occurs when it is optimal for an individual,
 having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior
 of the preceding individual with regard to his own information. The
 authors argue that localized conformity of behavior and the fragility of
 mass behaviors can be explained by informational cascades.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
