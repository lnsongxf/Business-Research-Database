Title:   Social Norms, Savings Behavior, and Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1092-1125
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors argue that many goods and decisions are not allocated or made
 through markets. They interpret an agent's status as a ranking device that
 determines how well he or she fares in the nonmarket sector. The existence
 of a nonmarket sector can endogenously generate a concern for relative
 position in, for example, the income distribution so that higher income
 implies higher status. Moreover, it can naturally yield multiple
 equilibria. It is thus possible to explain differences in growth rates
 across countries without recourse to differences in underlying
 preferences, technologies, or endowments. Different social organizations
 lead to different reduced-form preferences, which lead to different growth
 rates.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Growth in Cities. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1126-52
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Recent theories of economic growth, including those of P. Romer (1986,
 1990), M. Porter (1990), and J. Jacobs (1969, 1984), have stressed the
 role of technological spillovers in generating growth. Because such
 knowledge spillovers are particularly effective in cities, where
 communication between people is more extensive, data on the growth of
 industries in different cities allow the authors to test some of these
 theories. Using a new data set on the growth of large industries in 170
 U.S. cities between 1956 and 1987, they find that local competition and
 urban variety, but not regional specialization, encourage employment
 growth in industries. The evidence suggests that important knowledge
 spillovers might occur between rather than within industries. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Oligopolistic Pricing and the Effects of Aggregate Demand on Economic Activity. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1153-1207
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a dynamic general equilibrium model in which the
 typical industry colludes by threatening to punish deviations from an
 implicitly agreed-on pricing path. They use methods similar to those of F.
 Kydland and E. Prescott (1982) to calibrate linearized versions of both
 their model and an analogous perfectly concerning model. The authors then
 compute the two models' predictions concerning the economy's responses to
 a change in military spending. The responses predicted by the
 oligopolistic model are closer to the empirical responses estimated with
 postwar U.S. data than the corresponding predictions of the competitive
 model.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Tragedy of the Commons and Economic Growth: Why Does Capital Flow from Poor to Rich Countries? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1208-31
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a differential game in which all interest groups have
 access to a common capital stock. They show that the introduction of a
 technology that has inferior productivity but enjoys private access may
 ameliorate the tragedy of the commons. The authors use this model to
 analyze capital flight: in many poor countries, property rights are not
 well defined; since "safe" bank accounts in rich countries (the inferior
 technology) are available to citizens of these countries, they engage in
 capital flight. They show that the occurrence of capital flight does not
 imply that opening the capital account reduces growth and welfare.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Quality-Adjusted Cost Functions and Policy Evaluation in the Nursing Home Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1232-56
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Proper evaluation of cost-quality trade-offs inherent in regulatory
 policy requires identifying the structure of production from the
 behavioral response of quality to the policy change. However, estimating
 the structure of production with endogenous quality is difficult because
 of both measurement problems and data availability. The authors develop a
 simple method for identifying and estimating cost functions in the
 presence of endogenous and unobserved quality. Using this method, they
 estimate that a quality-adjusted cost function for nursing homes treating
 quality as exogenous yields seriously misleading estimates of marginal
 cost and economies of scale.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Are All Economic Hypotheses False? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1257-72
Issue: 6
Volume: 100
Year: 1992
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop an estimator that allows them to calculate an upper
 bound to the fraction of unrejected null hypotheses tested in economics
 journal articles that are in fact true. Their point estimate is that none
 of the unrejected nulls in their sample is true. The authors reject the
 hypothesis that more than one-third are true. They consider three
 explanations for this finding: that all null hypotheses are mere
 approximations, that data-mining biases reported standard errors downward,
 and that journals tend to publish papers that fail to reject their null
 hypotheses only when the they are likely to be false.  Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.
