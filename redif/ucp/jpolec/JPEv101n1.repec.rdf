Title:   Gaining Ground: Poverty in the Postwar United States. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-38
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  Official measures of poverty in the United States are compiled by the
 Census Bureau by comparing a household's income level to a prespecified
 threshold. From a theoretical perspective it is more appropriate to
 evaluate the level of poverty using a consumption-based measure of
 household welfare. This paper evaluate s the level of poverty using
 expenditure data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. It finds that
 consumption-based poverty rates ar e much lower than income-based ones.
 The trend in the poverty rate in the United States is sensitive to the
 price index and equivalence scales used to adjust the poverty thresholds.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Induced Innovation in American Agriculture: A Reconsideration. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 100-118
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the role of induced innovation in the development
 of American agriculture from 1880 to 1980. The induced innovation
 hypothesis, most closely associated with the work of Yujiro Hayami and
 Vernon W. Ruttan, argues that successful economies develop technologies in
 accordance with market price signals to loosen constraints on growth
 imposed by factor scarcities. The analysis employing new state and
 regional level data fails to find support fo r their hypothesis. This
 paper suggests that many of the fundamental generalizations about American
 agricultural development need to be considered and redirects attention to
 the role of settlement, changi ng crop patterns, and biological
 investments in explaining changes in factor utilization.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Allocative Efficiency of Markets with Zero-Intelligence Traders: Market as a Partial Substitute for Individual Rationality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 119-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  This paper reports market experiments in which human traders are replaced
 by "zero-intelligence" programs that submit random bids and offers.
 Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., n ot permitting traders to sell below
 their costs or buy above their valu es) is sufficient to raise the
 allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative
 efficiency of a double auction deri ves largely from its structure,
 independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam
 Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have thought; it
 can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality
 but also from individual irrationality.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Trade Liberalization and the Theory of Endogenous Protection: An Econometric Study of U.S. Import Policy. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 138-60
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  Trade theorists continue to puzzle over their surprisingly small
 estimates of the impact of trade liberalization o n imports. All
 explanations of the puzzle treat trade liberalization as a given but the
 level of trade protection is not exogenous. The theo ry of endogenous
 protection predicts that higher levels of import penetration will lead to
 greater protection. This paper finds that, when trade protection is
 modeled endogenously, its restrictive impact on imports is large--ten
 times the size obtained from treating protection exogenously.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Product Liability, Research and Development, and Innovation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 161-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  Product liability ideally should promote efficient levels of product
 safety but misdirected liability efforts may depre ss beneficial
 innovations. This paper examines these competing effects of liability
 costs on product R&D intensity and new product introductio ns by
 manufacturing firms. At low to moderate levels of expected liabil ity
 costs, there is a positive effect of liability costs on product
 innovation. At very high levels of liability costs, the effect is
 negative. At the sample mean, liability costs increase R&D intensity by 15
 percent. The greater linkage of these effects to product R&D i s
 consistent with the increased prominence of the design defect doctrine.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Courtship as a Waiting Game.

Abstract:
  In most times and places, women on average marry older men. The authors
 suggest a partial explanation. If the economi c roles of males are more
 specialized than those of females, the desirability of a female as a mate
 may become evident at an earlier age than is the case for males. Males
 with good prospects will wait unti l their economic success is revealed
 before choosing a bride. Those wi th poor prospects try to marry young. In
 equilibrium, the most desirabl e young females choose successful older
 males. The less desirable youn g females have no better option than to
 marry available young males.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumption and Income Seasonality in Thailand. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 39-72
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  Many households in developing countries rely on seasonal agriculture for
 their incomes. This paper investigates whet her household consumption
 expenditure tracks income across seasons. Wit h data from Thailand, the
 paper contrasts the seasonal consumption patterns of households with
 different seasonal income patterns and estimates the responsiveness of
 seasonal consumption to seasonal income. Little evidence is found that
 consumption tracks income over the course of the year. The findings
 suggest that observed seasonal consumption patterns are the result of
 seasonal variations in preferences or prices, common to all households,
 rather than an inability of households to use savings behavior to smooth
 consumptio n.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Accumulation of Human Capital and the Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 73-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  February  
Abstract:
  Characteristics of business cycles are quite different across developed
 countries. Real wages and working hours a re less sensitive to exogenous
 shocks in the United States than in Brit ain and Japan. Using a model with
 a microeconomic foundation, this paper provides an economic explanation of
 these differences. The cost of on-the-job training plays a crucial role.
 Workers seldom quit their jobs when the sunk training cost is high. In
 such economies, varianc es in employment and output become small and
 shocks tend to be absorbed by working hours and real wages. Thus, these
 characteristics do not necessarily indicate that the economy is more
 efficient.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
