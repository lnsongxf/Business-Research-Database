Title:   A Cross-Country, Cross-Industry Comparison of Productivity Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 207-22
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper presents evidence on the nature of productivity growth for
 five major industries in six countries. Outp ut growth is found to be more
 correlated across countries than productivity growth. In addition,
 productivity growth is more correlated across industries within one
 country than across countrie s within one industry. Using an
 error-components model, the paper find s that a substantial fraction of
 changes in annual productivity can be attributed to nation-specific
 factors that are common across industries. The evidence suggests that
 short-run productivity growth is similar across industries in a nation but
 less similar across countr ies in any specific industry.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Credit Market Constraints, Consumption Smoothing, and the Accumulation of Durable Production Assets in Low-Income Countries: Investment in Bullocks in India. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 223-44
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper formulates and estimates a finite-horizon, structural dynamic
 model of agricultural investment behavior that incorporates the major
 features of low-income agricultural environments: income uncertainty,
 constraints on borrowing and rental markets, and the use of investment
 assets to generate income and smooth consumption. The model is fit to
 longitudinal Indian household data on farm profits, bullock stocks, and
 pump sets. The estimated structural parameters are used to assess th e
 effects on the life-cycle accumulation of bullocks, agricultural profits,
 and welfare associated with complete markets and bullock liquidity and
 with second-best policies that provide assured sources of income to
 farmers and weather insurance.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Labor Hoarding and the Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 245-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the sensitivity of Solow residual based measures
 of technology shocks to labor-hoarding behavior. Using a structural model
 of labor hoarding and the identifying restriction that innovations to
 technology shocks are orthogonal to innovations in government consumption,
 the authors estimate the fraction of the variability of the Solow residual
 that is due to technology shocks. Their results support the view that a
 significant proportion of movements in the Solow residual are artifa cts
 of labor-hoarding behavior. Specifically, the authors estimate that the
 variance of innovations to technology is roughly 50 percent less than that
 implied by standard real business cycle models.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Occupational Choice and the Process of Development. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 274-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper models economic development as a process of institutional
 transformation by focusing on the interplay between agents' occupational
 decisions and the distribution of wealth. Becau se of capital-market
 imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wa ge over self-employment
 and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with
 sufficient inequality, however, will ther e be employment contracts;
 otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static
 equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the
 latter is itself endogenous, the authors demonstrate the robustness of
 this result b y extending the model dynamically and studying examples in
 which initi al wealth distributions have long-run effects.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Takeovers Improve Firm Performance: Evidence from the Banking Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 299-326
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The hypothesis that takeovers provide managers with the incentive to
 maximize firm value is tested by examining the relationship between
 profitability and state statutes governing takeover activity among banks.
 The evidence indicates that firms in states with an active takeover market
 are more profitable. When takeover activity is restricted, increased use
 of other mechanisms t hat provide an incentive to maximize firm value,
 such as concentration o f equity ownership and management ownership of
 stock, is observed. However, these alternative methods have a smaller
 effect on profitability and do not completely compensate for the absence
 of an active takeover market.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effect of Taxation on Human Capital. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 327-50
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This study finds a significant negative effect of proportional income
 taxation on human capital. Of the few earlier studies to address this
 issue, most suggested a negligible effect of taxation on investment on
 human capital. This earlier conclusion is shown to be incorrect by using a
 model that is more general in sever al respects than the models used
 previously.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Durable Goods: An Explanation for Their Slow Adjustment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 351-84
Issue: 2
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Aggregate expenditure on durables responds only slowly to wealth and
 other aggregate innovations. In this paper, the author develops new
 results on the problem of dynamic aggregation of stochastically
 heterogeneous units, which help to characterize the connection between
 microeconomic intermittent behavior and aggregate dynamics. Using these
 results and splitting postwar U.S. aggregate durable purchases into
 different subcategories and time periods, the author provides further
 support for the view that lumpy microeconomi c purchases play an important
 role in explaining the time-series behavior of aggregate expenditure on
 durable goods.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
