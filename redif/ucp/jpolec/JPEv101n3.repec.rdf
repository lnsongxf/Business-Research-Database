Title:   Nobel Lecture: The Economic Way of Looking at Behavior. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 385-409
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  An important step in extending the traditional theory of individual
 rational choice to analyze social issues beyond those usually considered
 by economists is to incorporate into the theory a much richer class of
 attitudes, preferences, and calculations. While this approach to behavior
 builds on an expanded.theory of individual choice, it is not mainly
 concerned with individuals. It uses theory at the micro level as a
 powerful tool to derive implications at the group or macro level. The
 lecture describes the approach and illustrates it with examples drawn from
 the author's past and current work.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Wage Inequality and the Rise in Returns to Skill. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 410-42
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Using data from the March Current Population Survey, the authors document
 an increase over the past 30 years in wage inequality for males. Between
 1963 and 1989, real average weekly wages for the least skilled workers
 declined by about 5 percent, whereas wages for the most skilled workers
 rose by about 40 percent. The authors find that the trend toward increased
 wage inequality is apparent within narrowly defined education and labor
 market experience groups. Their interpretation is that much of the
 increase in wage inequality fro males over the last 20 years is due to
 increased returns to the components of skill other than years of schooling
 and years of labor market experience.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Invention and Bounded Learning by Doing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 443-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper attempts to integrate traditional models of invention and
 learning by doing, developing a model that emphasizes the interdependence
 between research activity in the laboratory and production experience on
 the factory floor. Learning depends on invention in that learning by doing
 is viewed as the exploration of the finite and bounded productive
 potential of invented technologies. At the same time, the profitability of
 costly invention is dependent on learning in that costs of production
 depend on cumulative learning experience.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On Price Recognition and Computational Complexity in a Monopolistic Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 473-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A single seller of an indivisible good operates in a market with many
 consumers who differ in their ability to process information. The
 consumers' constraints are modeled in two submodels: the first in terms of
 the limits on the number of sets in the partition of the price space, and
 the second in terms of the limits on the complexity of the operation he
 can use to process a price offer. For the construction of the second
 submodel, the tool of a 'perceptron' is borrowed from the parallel
 computation literature. The author demonstrates that the heterogeneity of
 consumers' abilities can be used by the seller to profitably discriminate
 among them.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Taxation in Models of Endogenous Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 485-517
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors study the problem of optimal taxation in three
 infinite-horizon, representative-agent endogenous growth models. The first
 model is a convex model in which physical and human capital are perfectly
 symmetric. The authors' second model incorporates elastic labor supply
 through a Lucas-style technology. Analysis of these two models points out
 the danger of assuming that government expenditures are exogenous. In
 their third model, the authors include government expenditures as a
 productive input in capital formation, showing that the limiting tax rate
 on capital is no longer zero. In numerical simulations, they find similar
 effects on growth and welfare in all three models.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Detection of Bid Rigging in Procurement Auctions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 518-38
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines bidding in auctions for state highway construction
 contracts, in order to determine whether bid rigging occurred. Detection
 of collusion is possible because of limited participation in the collusive
 scheme. Collusion did not take the form of a bid rotation scheme. Instead,
 several ring members bid on most jobs. One was a serious bidder, and the
 other submitted phony higher bids. The bids of noncartel firms, as well as
 their rank distribution, were related to cost measures. In contrast, the
 rank distribution of higher cartel bids was unrelated to similar cost
 measures and differed from that of the low cartel bid.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Monitoring Costs in Chinese Agricutural Teams. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 539-53
Issue: 3
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Large productivity gains have been observed in Chinese agriculture
 following the transition from collective farming to household contracting.
 Using a model of mutual monitoring in an egalitarian production team, the
 authors estimate that labor supervision absorbed about 10-20 percent of
 total labor time for a sample of Chinese agricultural teams during
 1970-76. These agency costs are lower than comparable estimates derived
 from aggregate data.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
