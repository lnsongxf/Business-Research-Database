Title:   Decomposing Learning by Doing in New Plants. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 561-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper examines learning by doing in the context of a production
 function in which the other arguments are labor, human capital, physical
 capital, and vintage as a proxy for embodied technical change in physical
 capital. Learning is further decomposed into organization learning,
 capital learning, and manual task learning. The model is tested with
 time-series and cross-section data for various samples of up to 2,150
 plants over a fourteen-year period.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Price Support, Acreage Controls, and Efficient Redistribution. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 584-611
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This study is concerned with the combination of target price and acreage
 controls as the two major mechanisms of farm policy. Acreage controls are
 shown to enhance the efficiency of redistribution under a target price
 program. More specifically, this study demonstrates that, if the
 traditional Cobb-Douglas production function is assumed, acreage controls
 do not enhance the efficiency of target price programs in the process of
 redistributing income to the farm sector. The study proves that, if the
 elasticity of substitution between land and all other inputs is less than
 one, then the income redistributional costs are likely to be reduced.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rules of Thumb for Social Learning. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 612-43
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper studies agents who consider the experiences of their neighbors
 in deciding which of two technologies to use. The authors analyze two
 learning environments, one in which the same technology is optimal for all
 players and another in which each technology is better for some of them.
 In both environments, players use exogenously specified rules of thumb
 that ignore historical data but may incorporate a tendency to use the more
 popular technology. In some cases, these naive rules can lead to fairly
 efficient decisions in the long run but adjustment can be slow when a
 superior technology is first introduced.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Adverse Selection in the Wholesale Used Car Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 644-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an empirical investigation of adverse selection in
 the wholesale used car market. New car dealers (who sell both new and used
 cars) differ from used car dealers (who sell only used cars) in the
 propensity to sell trade-ins on the wholesale market. Models of adverse
 selection suggest that the dealer type that sells a higher proportion of
 its trade-ins on the wholesale market will sell, on average, cars of
 higher quality and receive in return a higher price. A survey of dealers'
 wholesale behavior and prices collected at a wholesale auction are used to
 test this prediction.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Rising Price of Husbands: A Hedonic Analysis of Dowry Increases in Rural India. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 666-77
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Dowries of South Asia have steadily risen over the last forty years and
 now often amount to over 50 percent of a household's assets. This paper
 attempts to investigate the reasons behind this increase. It adapts
 Rosen's implicit market model to the Indian marriage market and tests
 predictions from the model with data from six villages in south central
 India and from the Indian census. It is found that a 'marriage squeeze'
 caused by population growth, resulting in larger younger cohorts and hence
 a surplus of women in the marriage market, has played a significant role
 in the rise in dowries.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Market Liquidity and Performance Monitoring. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 678-709
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that the stock price incorporates performance
 information that cannot be extracted from the firm's current or future
 profit data. The additional information is useful for structuring
 managerial incentives. The amount of information contained in the stock
 price depends on the liquidity of the market. Concentrated ownership, by
 reducing market liquidity, reduces the benefits of market monitoring.
 Integration is associated with weakened managerial incentives and less
 market monitoring. The paper also studies the equilibrium size of the
 stock market as a function of investor preferences and the available
 amounts of long- and short-term capital.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Effects of Family Background on Earnings and Returns to Schooling: Evidence from Brazil. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 710-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate whether omitted family background variables are
 responsible for high returns to schooling estimated in Brazil. Returns to
 schooling fall by about one-third when parental schooling is added to wage
 equations. Surprisingly, the schooling of fathers-in-law has larger
 effects on wages than the schooling of fathers. On the basis of a model of
 assortative mating, the authors interpret this as evidence that parental
 characteristics represent unobservable worker attributes rather than
 nepotism in the labor market. They conclude that the 'family background
 bias' in returns to schooling is modest and need not imply returns to
 family connections.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Antitrust and Prices. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 741-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This study examines the effects of antitrust prosecution on prices
 charged by firms indicted for price fixing. In a survey of twenty-five
 cases filed between 1973 and 1984, prices are found to gradually rise by
 about 7 percent over the four years following an indictment. However, the
 severity of penalties is negatively correlated with prices. These two
 findings suggest either that penalties are too lenient or that prosecution
 is too broad, penalizing economically efficient conspiracies along with
 those that are inefficient.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
