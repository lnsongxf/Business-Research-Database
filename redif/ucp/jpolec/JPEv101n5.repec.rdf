Title:   Inventories in a Competitive Environment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 863-86
Issue: 5
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Trade is sequential: buyers arrive in batches and each batch completes
 trade before the next arrives. Producers allocate the available supply
 among all potential batches of buyers. Inventories accumulate whenever a
 batch does not arrive. Shocks to cost and demand are serially independent.
 There is a stationary relationship between inventories and prices with the
 following properties. Larger beginning-of-period inventories tend to
 depress prices. Inventories are positively serially correlated. A unit
 increase in inventories leads to an increase in the price spread. Output
 tends to vary more than sales.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Auditing Standards, Legal Liability, and Auditor Wealth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 887-914
Issue: 5
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  There has been an enormous increase in auditing and accounting standards
 and in litigation against auditors. This paper examines some of the
 consequences of these changes by developing a model of the audit market
 relating auditors' liability to auditing standards. The paper demonstrates
 how equilibrium audit fees depend on both the informational value of the
 audit and the option value of the claim financial statement users have on
 the auditor's wealth in the event the audit is determined to have been
 substandard. Auditors' attitudes toward and responses to auditing
 standards are studied, and characteristics of optimal liability rules are
 evaluated.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 915-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Recent empirical work indicates that job creation and destruction rates
 are large, implying significant amounts of job reallocation across firms.
 This paper builds a general equilibrium model of this reallocation
 process, calibrates it using data on firm-level dynamics, and evaluates
 the aggregate implications of policies that interfere with this process.
 We find that a tax on job destruction at the firm level has a sizable
 negative impact on total employment: a tax equal to 1 year's wages reduces
 employment by roughly 2.5 percent. More striking, however, are the welfare
 consequences: the cost in terms of consumption of this same tax is greater
 than 2 percent.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Issue: 5
Volume: 101

Month:  October 
Abstract:
  When harassed users adopt new ways of transaction, supply changes in
 predictable ways. This linkage between demand and supply can explain a
 number of puzzling consequences of the decriminalization of marijuana and
 the war on heroin and cocaine.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
