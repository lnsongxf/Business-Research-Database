Title:   Measures of Fit for Calibrated Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1011-41
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper suggests a new procedure for evaluating the fit of a dynamic
 structural economic model. The procedure begins by augmenting the
 variables in the model with just enough stochastic error so that the model
 can exactly match the second moments of the actual data. Measures of fit
 for the model can then be constructed on the basis of the size of this
 error. The procedure is applied to a standard real business cycle model.
 Over the business cycle frequencies, the model must be augmented with a
 substantial error to match data for the postwar U.S. economy.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On Endogenous Growth with Physical and Human Capital. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1042-67
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a class of models in which agents may devote part of
 their nonleisure activities to going to school so as to increase the
 efficiency units of labor they supply to the firms and the wages they
 receive. The interaction among the technology of human capital
 accumulation and agents' preferences will determine endogenously the
 economy's rate of growth. Given a constant returns to scale technology for
 physical capital accumulation, the authors characterize the set of steady
 states as a ray from  the origin and show the global convergence of every
 off-balanced path to some point on this ray.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Hawtrey, Harvard, and the Origins of the Chicago Tradition. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1068-1103
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Milton Friedman has claimed that his monetary economics derives from a
 Chicago tradition that, in the 1930s, offered a monetary explanation of
 cyclical fluctuations in general and the Great Depression in particular,
 an optimistic view of the power of monetary policy, and a case for
 governing it by rules rather than discretion. It is argued that all the
 elements of this tradition except the last are to be found in earlier
 writings of Ralph Hawtrey, Allyn Young, and Lauchlin Currie and that there
 is much evidence to point to a direct influence running from Hawtrey,
 through Harvard, to Chicago.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   How Prudent Are Consumers? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1104-13
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, this paper presents a
 simple test that provides an explicit estimate of the parameter in the
 utility function that reflects the strength of the precautionary saving
 motive, the coefficient of relative prudence. The test yields a fairly
 precise estimate of a small precautionary motive; in fact, the estimate is
 too small to be consistent with widely accepted beliefs about risk
 aversion. The presence of liquidity-constrained households does not appear
 to explain this finding and there is some evidence that self-selection of
 households into risky environments also cannot explain the results.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effect of Rent Control on Housing Quality Change: A Longitudinal Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1114-48
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  It is widely believed that rent control leads to a decline in the quality
 of rental housing. This study examines the effect of rent control on the
 quality of rental housing in New York City. Quality change is linked to
 the suppression of rent below market levels and other characteristics of
 the housing unit. The authors develop a first-order nonstationary,
 heterogeneous Markov model that allows for true state dependence, observed
 heterogeneity, nonparametric unobserved heterogeneity, and a mover-stayer
 structure. The results offer some support for the belief that rent control
 leads to a deterioration in housing quality but suggest the need for
 additional investigation of this issue.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   International Factor Price Differences: Leontief Was Right! 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 961-87
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The factor price equalization hypothesis is widely at odds with the large
 variation in factor prices across countries. similarly, the
 Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek theorem constitutes an incomplete description of
 trade in factor services: its predictions are always rejected empirically.
 These two issues are examined using a modification of the
 Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model that allows for factor-augmenting
 international productivity differences. The empirical results are stark:
 this simple modification of the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek theorem explains
 much of the factor content of trade and the cross-country variation in
 factor prices.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Separate Spheres Bargaining and the Marriage Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 988-1010
Issue: 6
Volume: 101
Year: 1993
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper introduces the 'separate spheres' bargaining model, a new
 model of distribution within marriage. It differs from divorce threat
 bargaining models in that the threat point is not divorce but a
 noncooperative equilibrium within marriage; this noncooperative
 equilibrium reflects traditional gender roles. The predictions of the
 authors' model thus differ from those of divorce threat bargaining models;
 in the separate spheres model, cash transfer payments to the mother and
 payments to the father can--but need not--imply different equilibrium
 distributions in existing marriages. In the long run, the distributional
 effects of transfer policies may be substantially altered by changes in
 the marriage market equilibrium.  Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press.
