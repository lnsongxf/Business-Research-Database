Title:   Rational Frenzies and Crashes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-23
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Most markets clear through a sequence of sales rather than through a
 Walrasian auctioneer. Because buyers can decide whether to buy now or
 later, rather than only now or never, their current 'willingness to pay'
 is much more sensitive to price than the demand curve is. A consequence is
 that markets will be extremely sensitive to new information, leading to
 both 'frenzies,' in which demand feeds on itself, and 'crashes,' in which
 price drops discontinuously. The paper also shows how a result from static
 auction theory, the revenue equivalence theorem, can be applied to solve
 for a dynamic price path.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Preying for Monopoly? The Case of Southern Bell Telephone Company, 1894-1912. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 103-26
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Focusing on the Southern Bell Telephone Company, the authors propose a
 modified version of the predation hypothesis to explain Bell's 'natural'
 monopoly over local telephone service. Southern Bell effectively
 eliminated competition through a strategy of pricing below cost in
 response to entry, which deprived competitors of the cash flow required
 for expansion even if it failed to induce exit; investing in toll lines
 ahead of demand, isolating independent companies in smaller towns and
 rural areas, and forcing them to consolidate on favorable terms; and
 influencing local regulatory policy in larger cities to weaken rivals and
 ultimately to institutionalize the Bell monopoly.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Model of Competitive Stock Trading Volume. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 127-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  A model of competitive stock trading is developed in which investors are
 heterogeneous in their information and private investment opportunities
 and rationally trade for both informational and noninformational motives.
 The author examines the link between the nature of heterogeneity among
 investors and the behavior of trading volume and its relation to price
 dynamics. It is found that volume is positively correlated with absolute
 changes in prices and dividends. The author shows that informational
 trading and noninformational trading lead to different dynamic relations
 between trading volume and stock returns.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Microeconometric Analysis of Risk Aversion and the Decision to Self-Insure. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 169-86
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This study estimates a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function using
 market data and microeconometric methods. The authors investigate the
 decision whether to purchase insurance against the risk of telephone line
 trouble in the home. Using the choices of approximately 10,000 residential
 customers, they determine the shape of the utility function and the degree
 of risk aversion. The authors find that risk aversion varies
 systematically in the population and varies with the level of income, and
 that the observed choice behavior is consistent with expected utility
 maximization.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Bequest as a Public Good within Marriage: A Note. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 187-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Bequest to and marriage of children can lead to a Pareto-inefficient
 allocation. The inefficiency (or market failure) arises because one
 family, making a bequest to its own child, ignores the contribution to the
 utility of the other family whose child enters the marriage. This note
 shows that an assortative mating rule based on bequests can improve or
 even restore Pareto efficiency when parents take account of the rule in
 deciding the amount of bequests to their own children.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Favoritism versus Search for Good Papers: Empirical Evidence Regarding the Behavior of Journal Editors. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 194-203
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Journal editors who publish papers authored by colleagues and former
 graduate students have been charged with practicing favoritism, with the
 implication that the papers in question are of lower quality than those
 written by scholars with no ties to the editor. Using citation analysis,
 the authors find strong evidence that although journal editors
 occasionally publish subpar papers authored by colleagues and former
 graduate students, on balance their use of professional connections
 enables them to identify and 'capture' high-impact papers for publication.
 This implies that a practice interpreted as favoritism by many scholars in
 fact serves to enhance efficiency in the market for scientific knowledge.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competitive Diffusion. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 24-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the evolution of a competitive industry in which a
 fixed number of firms reduce costs by innovating and by imitating their
 rivals' technologies. As the firms' technologies gradually improve,
 industry output expands and price falls. Technological leaders tend to
 rely on innovations to reduce their costs, whereas the laggards rely more
 on imitation. Imitation causes technology to spread from the leaders to
 the followers and forces some convergence of technology among firms as the
 industry matures. This convergence is accompanied by faster growth of
 smaller firms and a consequent tightening of the distribution of output
 over firms.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sticking It Out: Entrepreneurial Survival and Liquidity Constraints. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 53-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors examine survival rates of entrepreneurial enterprises and
 their growth, conditional on surviving. Their focus is on whether
 liquidity constraints increase the likelihood of entrepreneurial failure.
 The empirical strategy is based on the following logic: If entrepreneurs
 cannot borrow to attain their profit-maximizing levels of capital, then
 entrepreneurs with substantial personal financial resources will be more
 successful than those without. The authors examine the behavior of a group
 of sole proprietors who received substantial inheritances. The results are
 consistent with the notion that liquidity constraints exert a noticeable
 influence on the viability of entrepreneurial enterprises.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Short-Time Compensation: Job Security, and Employment Contracts: Evidence from Selected OECD Countries. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 76-102
Issue: 1
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  In this paper, a model of optimal employment contracting describes
 differences across countries in firing restrictions and short-time
 compensation systems for workers forced to work shorter hours to avoid
 layoff. The model predicts that the existence of a short-time compensation
 system will generate major fluctuations in working hours only if the
 short-time compensation system is more generous than the traditional
 unemployment insurance system. A test performed for ten OECD countries
 shows that in countries with generous short-time compensation systems, the
 speed of adjustment of total hours worked is higher than in the United
 States, despite a much slower adjustment in the number of workers
 employed.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
