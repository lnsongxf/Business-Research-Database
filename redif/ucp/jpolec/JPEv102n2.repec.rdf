Title:   Adverse Selection, Commitment, and Renegotiation: Extension to and Evidence from Insurance Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 209-35
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  With asymmetric information, full commitment to long-term contracts may
 permit markets to approach first-best allocations. However, commitment can
 be undermined by opportunistic behavior, notably renegotiation. The
 authors reexamine commitment in insurance markets. They present an
 alternative model (which extends Jean-Jaques Laffont and Jean Tirole's
 procurement model to address uncertainty and competition), which involves
 semipooling in the first period followed by separation. This and competing
 models (e.g., single-period models and no-commitment models) have
 different predictions concerning temporal patterns of insurer
 profitability. A test using California data suggests that some automobile
 insurers use commitment to attract selective portfolios comprising
 disproportionate numbers of low risks.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Evidence on Adverse Selection: Equilibrium Signaling and Cross-Subsidization in the Insurance Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 236-57
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The configuration of equilibrium in the market for automobile collision
 insurance is examined empirically by representing the premium-deductible
 menu and the demand function as a standard hedonic system. Using
 contractual data from a representative insurer, the authors estimate a
 reduced-form hedonic premium equation and the inverse of the marginal bid
 equation for insurance coverage. The data reveal an equilibrium with
 adverse selection and market signaling but lead the authors to reject the
 hypothesis that high risks receive contracts subsidized by low risks.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Risk Aversion, Performance Pay, and the Principal-Agent Problem. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 258-76
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper calculates numerical solutions to the principal-agent problem
 and compares the results to the stylized facts of CEO compensation. The
 numerical predictions come from parameterizing the models of Sanford J.
 Grossman and Oliver D. Hart (1983) and of Bengt Holmstrom and Paul Milgrom
 (1987). While the correct incentives for a CEO can greatly enhance a
 firm's performance, providing such incentives need not be expensive. For
 many parameter values, CEO compensation need increase only by about $10
 for every $1,000 of additional shareholder value; for some values, the
 amount is 0.003 cents.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Privatizing the Church: Disestablishment in Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 277-97
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Tax-supported churches were established in most American colonies. Public
 Congregationalist churches in New England were not privatized until the
 early nineteenth century. After privatization, demand for preachers rose
 rapidly. There is weaker evidence that church membership also rose
 quickly. The increase in preachers came almost totally from private
 denominations. The privatization of religion was further accompanied by a
 change in methods of finance.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Barriers to Technology Adoption and Development. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 298-321
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors propose a theory of economic development in which technology
 adoption and barriers to such adoptions are the focus. The size of these
 barriers differs across countries and time. The larger these barriers, the
 greater the investment a firm must make to adopt a more advanced
 technology. The model is calibrated to the U.S. balanced growth
 observations and the postwar Japanese development miracle. For this
 calibrated structure, the authors find that the disparity in technology
 adoption barriers needed to account for the huge observed income disparity
 across countries is not implausibly large.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Life Cycle of a Competitive Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 322-47
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Firm numbers first rise, then later fall, as an industry evolves. This
 nonmonotonicity is explained using a competitive model in which innovation
 opportunities fuel entry and relative failure to innovate prompts exit;
 equilibrium time paths for price and quantity also share features of the
 data. The model is estimated using data from the U.S. automobile tire
 industry, a particularly dramatic example of the nonmonotonicity in firm
 numbers.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Capital Flows to the New World as an Intergenerational Transfer. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 348-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The late nineteenth century saw international mass migrations of capital
 and labor from the Old World to the New. Factors chased each other and the
 abundant resources at the frontier. Demographic structure also contributed
 to the massive capital flows from Britain to the New World. The dependency
 hypothesis is confirmed by estimation of savings functions in three New
 World economies (Argentina, Australia, and Canada) in which high
 dependency rates may have significantly depressed domestic savings rates
 and pulled in foreign investment: in effect an intergenerational transfer
 from old savers in the Old World to young savers in the New.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Simple Analytics of Productive Consumption. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 372-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The shadow price of a productive good is equal to its money price less
 its marginal product. As more of the good is consumed, its shadow price
 rises because of diminishing productivity and the consumer's full income
 also rises because the marginal product is positive. The direction of the
 overall bias induced by endogenous prices and income is found to be
 determinate. The authors demonstrate that the demand for productive goods
 tends to be relatively unresponsive to exogenous changes in prices and
 income. Similarly, labor supply will be relatively unresponsive to wage
 and unearned income if market work causes fatigue.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
