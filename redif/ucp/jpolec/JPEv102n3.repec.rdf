Title:   Adjustment of Consumers' Durables Stocks: Evidence from Automobile Purchases. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 403-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper tests an optimal (S, s) rule in household durable purchases
 and examines directly the resulting aggregate expenditure dynamics. The
 observed decision rule responds to income uncertainty and growth as
 predicted by an (S, s) model resulting from transactions costs. Tests
 against liquidity constraints find that about half the households purchase
 according to an optimal (S, s) rule. Aggregating the (S, s) rule over
 households produces a cross-section distribution of durables holdings. The
 empirical distribution is similar to that predicted theoretically, as is
 its response to aggregate shocks. Furthermore, simulations of aggregate
 expenditure based on the household distribution exhibit dynamics
 consistent with those observed in the 1980s.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Intertemporal Choice and Inequality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 437-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The permanent income hypothesis implies that, for any cohort of people,
 inequality in consumption and income should grow with age, a prediction
 that is here confirmed using data from eleven years of household survey
 data from the United States, twenty-two years from Great Britain, and
 fourteen years from Taiwan. In the permanent income hypothesis, the
 increase in inequality reflects the cumulative effect of luck on
 consumption. Other models of intertemporal choice--such as those with
 strong precautionary motives or liquidity constraints--can limit or even
 prevent the spread of inequality, as can insurance arrangements that share
 risk across individuals.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Cattle Cycles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 468-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  U.S. beef cattle stocks are among the most periodic economic time series.
 A theory of cattle cycles is constructed on the basis of breeding stock
 inventory decisions. The low fertility rate of cows and substantial lags
 and future feedback between fertility and consumption decisions cause the
 demographic structure of the herd to respond cyclically to exogenous
 shocks in demand and production costs. Known demographic parameters of
 cattle imply sharp numerical benchmarks for the resulting dynamic system
 and closely compare with independent econometric time-series estimates
 over the 1875-1990 period. The model fits extremely well.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Adjustment of Prices to Monetary Shocks When Trade Is Uncertain and Sequential. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 493-509
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Trade is both uncertain and sequential. Money surprises are not neutral
 because prices at the beginning of the trading process cannot depend on
 its end. In contrast with fixed-price models, in this paper sellers can
 change prices during trade. In contrast with Robert E. Lucas's article,
 here there is no asymmetry in the information about the money supply. The
 price quoted by individual sellers may adjust slowly to changes in the
 targeted money supply but the distribution of quoted prices adjusts
 perfectly to these changes and the real price distribution is independent
 of the anticipated rate of change in the money supply.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Top Executive Rewards and Firm Performance: A Comparison of Japan and the United States. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 510-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies top executive turnover and compensation, and their
 relation to firm performance in the largest Japanese and U.S. companies.
 Japanese executive turnover and compensation are related to earnings,
 stock returns, and performance measures. The fortunes of Japanese top
 executives, therefore, are positively correlated with stock performance
 and current cash flows (or with factors contributing to such performance).
 The relations for the Japanese executives are generally economically and
 statistically similar to those for their U.S. counterparts. There is some
 evidence, however, that the fortunes of Japanese executives are more
 sensitive to low income but less sensitive to stock returns than those of
 U.S. executives.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Giffen Goods, the Survival Imperative, and the Irish Potato Culture. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 547-65
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper modifies the modern explanation of Giffen behavior by
 incorporating the classical emphasis on subsistence. Specifically, the
 calculated redirection of consumption priorities by those reduced to
 subsistence levels is embodied in the utility function and the biological
 necessity of consuming sufficient nutrition to support health is modeled
 as a subsistence constraint. This methodology is then applied to the
 potato culture that existed in Ireland prior to the 1845-48 famine. It is
 suggested that the evolution of this culture was shaped by
 subsistence-driven behavior similar to the behavior that underlies the
 Giffen effect.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Public Finance of Private Goods: The Case of College Education. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 566-82
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper describes a contract theory of public finance of college
 education that explains why everyone pays for the college education of a
 lucky minority. The contract provides gambles that families desire.
 Optimizing the contract determines the taxes paid by all members of
 society, fees paid by those whose children go to college, the fraction of
 children who are admitted to college, and the quality of college
 education. Changes in wealth lead to changes in taxes and admissions but
 fees and quality are invariant. Using a cutoff level of precollege
 achievement to determine admission to college is justified by the theory.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Law Enforcement with Self-Reporting of Behavior. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 583-606
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Self-reporting--the reporting by parties of their own behavior to an
 enforcement authority--is a commonly observed aspect of law enforcement,
 such as in the context of environmental and safety regulation. The authors
 add self-reporting to the model of the control of harmful externalities
 through probabilistic law enforcement and they characterize the optimal
 scheme. Self-reporting offers two advantages over schemes without
 self-reporting: enforcement resources are saved because individuals who
 report their harmful acts need not be detected and risk is reduced because
 individuals who report their behavior bear certain rather than uncertain
 sanctions.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Comparing Optima: Do Simplifying Assumptions Affect Conclusions? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 607-15
Issue: 3
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Consider a family of maximization models in which the optimum trades off
 beneficial and costly effects. Then comparative statics derived under many
 kinds of simplifying assumptions about the benefits technology are also
 true for general (convex and nonconvex) technologies. For example, any
 comparative statics conclusion about investment by a risk-averse
 decisionmaker under uncertainty that holds when expected returns are
 described by a general linear function also holds for an arbitrary
 nonlinear expected return function.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
