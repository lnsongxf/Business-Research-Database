Title:   Optimal Fiscal Policy in a Business Cycle Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 617-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper develops the quantitative implications of optimal fiscal
 policy in a business cycle model. In a stationary equilibrium, the ex ante
 tax rate on capital income is approximately zero. The tax rate on labor
 income fluctuates very little and inherits the persistence properties of
 the exogenous shocks; thus there is no presumption that optimal labor tax
 rates follow a random walk. Most of the welfare gains realized by
 switching from a tax system like that of the United States to the Ramsey
 system come from an initial period of high taxation on capital income.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competition and Price Dispersion in the U.S. Airline Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 653-83
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors study dispersion in the prices an airline charges to
 different passengers on the same route. This variation in fares is
 substantial:  the expected absolute difference in fares between two
 passengers on a route is 36 percent of the airline's average ticket price.
 The pattern of observed price dispersion cannot easily be explained by
 cost differences alone. Dispersion increases on routes with more
 competition or lower flight density, consistent with discrimination based
 on customers' willingness to switch to alternative airlines or flights.
 The authors argue that the data support models of price discrimination in
 monopolistically competitive markets.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Human Relations in the Workplace. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 684-717
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper seeks to understand what motivates workers to be altruistic
 toward one another and studies whether firms benefit from encouraging
 these 'human relations' in the workplace. The paper first proposes that
 feelings of altruism can be individually rational in certain settings in
 which the variables controlled by the workers are strategically linked.
 The paper then studies what this implies for equilibrium altruism in two
 situations. The first has workers who are paid as a function of joint
 output. The second is the relationship between subordinates and their
 supervisors.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Empirical Performance of Orthodox Models of the Firm: Conventional Firms and Worker Cooperatives. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 718-44
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Though it is routinely posited that organizations with different property
 rights will not exhibit the same responses to changes in their economic
 environment, compelling evidence of such behavior is difficult to find.
 The authors collected observations on two types of firms--conventional
 proprietorships and worker-owned cooperatives--operating in the same
 industry, in the same location, and at the same period of time. They
 compare the firms' reactions to changes in their input and output prices
 and ask whether their reactions are consistent with orthodox models of
 profit and dividend maximization.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Coordination, Commitment, and Enforcement: The Case of the Merchant Guild. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 745-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors interpret historical evidence in light of a repeated-game
 model to conclude that merchant guilds emerged during the late medieval
 period to allow rulers of trade centers to commit to the security of alien
 merchants. The merchant guild developed the theoretically required
 attributes, secured merchants' property rights, and evolved in response to
 crises to extend the range of its effectiveness, contributing to the
 expansion of trade during the late medieval period. The authors elaborate
 on the relations between their theory and the monopoly theory of merchant
 guilds and contrast it with repeated-game theories that provide no role
 for formal organization.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Using Repeat Challengers to Estimate the Effect of Campaign Spending on Election Outcomes in the U.S. House. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 777-98
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Previous studies of congressional spending have typically found a large
 positive effect of challenger spending but little evidence for effects of
 incumbent spending. Those studies, however, do not adequately control for
 inherent differences in vote-getting ability across candidates. This paper
 examines elections in which the same two candidates face one another on
 more than one occasion; differencing eliminates the influence of any fixed
 candidate or district attributes. Estimates of the effects of challenger
 spending are an order of magnitude below those of previous studies.
 Campaign spending has an extremely small impact on election outcomes,
 regardless of who does the spending.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   State Responses to Fiscal Crises: The Effects of Budgetary Institutions and Politics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 799-821
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper explores the dynamics of state taxes and spending during the
 late 1980s when regional economic downturns and increased expenditure
 demands led to substantial state budget deficits. More restrictive state
 fiscal institutions, such as 'no-deficit carryover' rules and tax and
 expenditure limitations, are correlated with more rapid fiscal adjustment
 to unexpected deficits. Political factors are also important. When a
 single party controls the state house and the governorship, deficit
 adjustment is much faster than when party control is divided. In
 gubernatorial election years, tax increases and spending cuts are both
 significantly smaller than at other times.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Social Attributes and Strategic Equilibrium: A Restaurant Pricing Game. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 822-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Using a game-theoretic approach, the authors examine possible equilibrium
 explanations of the often-observed phenomenon that two neighboring
 restaurants offering similar menus nevertheless experience vastly
 different demands. The essential aspect of this analysis is the presence
 of a consumption externality that makes the popularity itself a factor in
 the determination of the relative attractiveness of the restaurants.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
