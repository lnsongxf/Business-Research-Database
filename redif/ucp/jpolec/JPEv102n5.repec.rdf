Title:   Productivity Growth and Firm Ownership: An Analytical and Empirical Investigation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1006-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors focus on the effect of state versus private ownership on the
 rates of firm-specific productivity growth and cost decline by developing
 a model of endogenous, firm-specific productivity growth and testing its
 implications against panel data on twenty-three international airlines of
 varying levels of state ownership over the period 1973-83. Their model and
 empirical results show that state ownership can lower the long-run annual
 rate of productivity growth or cost decline but not necessarily their
 levels in the short run. The analysis offers new insights concerning the
 recent trend toward privatizing state-owned enterprises that has been
 observed in many countries.   Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Marginal Deterrence in Enforcement of Law. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1039-66
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors characterize optimal enforcement in a setting in which
 individuals can select among various levels of some activity, all of which
 are monitored at the same rate but may be prosecuted and punished at
 varying rates. For less harmful acts, marginal expected penalties ought to
 fall short of marginal harms caused. Indeed, some range of very minor acts
 should be legalized. For more harmful acts, whether marginal expected
 penalties should fall short of or exceed marginal harms depends on the
 balance between monitoring and prosecution/punishment costs. The authors
 also explore how the optimal enforcement policy varies with changes in
 these costs.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Conformity. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 841-77
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a model in which individuals care about both
 consumption (intrinsic utility) and social status. Status depends on
 public perceptions about an individual's predispositions rather than on
 the individual's actions. However, since predispositions are unobservable,
 actions signal predispositions and therefore affect status. When status is
 sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals
 conform to a rigid standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous intrinsic
 preferences. When status is relatively unimportant, no conformity emerges.
 The model produces both customs and fads, and it suggests an explanation
 for the development of multiple subcultures with distinct norms.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   College Entry by Blacks since 1970: The Role of College Costs, Family Background, and the Returns to Education. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 878-911
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  College enrollment of black eighteen-nineteen-year-old high school
 graduates declined from 1980 through 1984 and then rebounded. This paper
 presents data from a time series of cross-sections of
 eighteen-nineteen-year-old youths from 1973 through 1988 to test the role
 of family background, direct college costs, local economic conditions, and
 returns to college in driving these trends. The evidence suggests that, on
 the one hand, increases in direct college costs were driving enrollment
 rates downward. On the other hand, dramatic increases in average parental
 education exerted upward pressure on college enrollment by blacks,
 particularly in the latter half of the decade.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Cultural Beliefs and the Organization of Society: A Historical and Theoretical Reflection on Collectivist and Individualist Societies. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 912-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper integrates game-theoretical and sociological concepts to
 conduct a comparative historical analysis of the relations between culture
 and institutions. It indicates the importance of culture, and in
 particular cultural beliefs, in determining institutions, in institutional
 path dependence, and in forestalling intersociety successful adoption of
 institutions. Examination of institutional change in two premodern
 societies from the Muslim and the Latin worlds yields that their distinct
 institutional structures resemble those found by social psychologists to
 differentiate contemporary developing and developed economies. This
 suggests the historical importance of distinct cultures and the related
 societal organizations in economic development.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Economic Impacts of the California One-Variety Cotton Law. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 951-74
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The California One-Variety Cotton Law, introduced in 1924, was intended
 to guarantee cotton quality and to mitigate externalities in cotton
 production arising from mixing different seed varieties at the gin. This
 paper presents quantitative estimates of the economic welfare effects of a
 partial deregulation under a 1978 amendment to the law. The original
 regulation benefited some, perhaps even most, cotton growers but became
 increasingly harmful to others and had adverse aggregate welfare effects.
 The persistence of this regulation may be due to its distributional
 effects. Partial deregulation yielded large increases in aggregate
 producer surplus but many cotton growers experienced small losses.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Selection Dynamics, Asymptotic Stability, and Adaptive Behavior. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 975-1005
Issue: 5
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Selection dynamics are often used to distinguish stable and unstable
 equilibria. This is particularly useful when multiple equilibria prevent a
 priori comparative static analysis. This paper reports an experiment
 designed to compare the accuracy of the myopic best-response dynamic and
 an inertial selection dynamic. The inertial selection dynamic makes more
 accurate predictions about the observed mutual best-response outcomes.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
