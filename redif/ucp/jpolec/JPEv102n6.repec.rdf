Title:   Income and Outcomes: A Structural Model of Intrahousehold Allocation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1067-96
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  There is evidence that one cannot treat many-person households as a
 single decisionmaker. If so, then factors such as the relative incomes of
 the household members may affect the final allocation decisions made by
 the household. The authors develop a method of identifying how incomes
 affect outcomes given conventional family expenditure data. They assume
 that household decision processes lead to efficient outcomes. The authors
 apply their method to a sample of Canadian couples with no children. They
 find that the final allocations of expenditures on each partner depend
 significantly on their relative incomes and ages and on the level of
 lifetime wealth.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Large Shareholder Activism, Risk Sharing, and Financial Market Equilibrium. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1097-1130
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a model in which a large investor has access to a
 costly monitoring technology affecting securities' expected payoffs.
 Allocations of shares are determined through trading among risk-averse
 investors. Despite the free-rider problem associated with monitoring,
 risk-sharing considerations lead to equilibria in which monitoring takes
 place. Under certain conditions, the equilibrium allocation is Pareto
 efficient and all agents hold the market portfolio of risky assets
 independent of the specific monitoring technology. Otherwise, distortions
 in risk sharing may occur and monitoring activities that reduce the
 expected payoff on the market portfolio may be undertaken.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Endowments and the Allocation of Schooling in the Family and in the Marriage Market: The Twins Experiment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1131-74
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors show how comparisons between the within-twin correlations of
 human capital outcomes across identical and nonidentical twins can be used
 to identify the variability in the individual-specific component of
 endowments and the responsiveness of schooling to individual-specific
 endowments in the family and in the marriage market even when schooling is
 measured with error. Estimates from two twins samples indicate that 27
 (42) percent of the variance in log earnings (obesity) is due to
 variability in individual-specific endowments, allocations of schooling
 reinforce specific endowments, and individual-specific earnings endowments
 of men and their wives' schooling are negatively associated.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Executive Compensation and Principal-Agent Theory. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1175-99
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The empirical literature on executive compensation generally fails to
 specify a model of executive pay on which to base hypotheses regarding its
 determinants. In contrast, this paper analyzes a simple principal-agent
 model to determine how well it explains variations in CEO incentive pay
 and salaries. Many findings are consistent with the basic intuition of
 principle-agent models that compensation is structured to trade off
 incentives with insurance. However, statistical significance for some of
 the effects is weak, although the magnitudes are large. Nevertheless, it
 seems clear that principle-agent considerations play a role in setting
 executive compensation.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Learning-by-Doing Spillovers in the Semiconductor Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1200-1227
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The semiconductor industry is often cited as a strategic industry in part
 because important learning spillovers may justify special industrial
 policies. Using quarterly, firm-level data on seven generations of dynamic
 random access memory semiconductors over 1974-92, the authors find that
 learning rates average 20 percent, firms learn three times more from an
 additional unit of their own cumulative production than from an additional
 unit of another firm's cumulative production, learning spills over just as
 much between firms in different countries as between firms within a given
 country, and intergenerational learning spillovers are weak.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Dynamic Impacts of Monetary Policy: An Exercise in Tentative Identification. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1228-47
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  It is currently popular to identify monetary policy shocks with
 innovations in some measure of reserves or in the federal funds rate.
 These assumptions about the interest elasticity of the supply of or demand
 for reserves imply monetary policy shocks that produce dynamic responses
 of macroeconomic variables that are anomalous relative to traditional
 monetary analyses. This paper tentatively identifies supply and demand
 shocks in the markets for reserves and M2 for the 1980s and contrasts them
 with results for the 1970s. In the later period, identified monetary
 policy shocks have dynamic impacts that are fully consistent with
 traditional analyses.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Tobin's q, Corporate Diversification, and Firm Performance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1248-80
Issue: 6
Volume: 102
Year: 1994
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors show that Tobin's q and firm diversification
 are negatively related throughout the 1980s. This negative relation holds
 for different diversification measures and when they control for other
 known determinants of q. Further, diversified firms have lower q's than
 comparable portfolios of pure-play firms. Firms that choose to diversify
 are poor performers relative to firms that do not but there is only weak
 evidence that they have lower q's than the average firm in their industry.
 The authors find no evidence supportive of the view that diversification
 provides firms with a valuable intangible asset.  Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press.
