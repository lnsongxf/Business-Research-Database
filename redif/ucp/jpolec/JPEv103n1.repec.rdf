Title:   Corporate Conservatism and Relative Compensation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper demonstrates that, in a simple setting with managerial concern
 for reputation and asymmetric information on ability, most managers may
 refrain from undertaking innovations that stochastically dominate an
 industry standard. Common components of uncertainty lead to market
 inferences of managerial ability based on relative performance. Managers
 who undertake the industry standard are consequently evaluated with a more
 accurate benchmark than those innovating. Discontinuities in compensation
 when performance is low lead managers to have differing valuations of an
 accurate benchmark, depending on type. In particular, very high and very
 low ability managers are more likely to undertake superior innovations
 than those of average ability.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Search, Bargaining, Money, and Prices. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 118-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This goal of this paper is to extend existing search-theoretic models of
 fiat money, which until now have assumed that the price level is
 exogenous, by explicitly incorporating bilateral bargaining. This allows
 the determination of the price level endogenously and leads to additional
 insights concerning the role of money. For example, the authors find that
 monetary equilibria are generally inefficient in the sense that output and
 prices differ from the solution to a social planner's problem, although
 the difference can become small as the discount rate or search friction
 vanishes. The authors also find that there exist nonstationary
 inflationary equilibria.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Restricting the Market for Quota: An Analysis of Tobacco Production Rights with Corroboration from Congressional Testimony. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 142-75
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Regulatory programs that restrict output levels often impose restrictions
 on the transfer of rights to produce or to use particular inputs. In this
 paper, the authors use a unique cross-section, time-series data set from
 North Carolina to quantify the welfare effects of transfer restrictions
 for poundage quota under the U.S. flue-cured tobacco program. The authors
 find that the deadweight costs of such restrictions are small but that the
 distributional effects are substantial. The authors analyze congressional
 testimony on quota transfer legislation and conclude that their estimates
 of the distributional effects are consistent with expressed views of
 market participants.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Credibility and Changes in Policy Regime. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 176-208
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a rational expectations model of inflation in which
 the dynamics are driven by government expenditure and the effect of past
 inflation rates on the value of real taxes. Government spending follows an
 autoregressive process subject to discrete regime changes. The regimes are
 defined by whether the expenditure level is consistent with the rate of
 inflation targeted by the government. The agents do not observe the regime
 but construct probability inferences using data on inflation, interest
 rates, and spending. Credibility is quantified by the agents' inferred
 probability that the variables are in effect generated by the reformed
 regime.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Can Markets Value Air Quality? A Meta-analysis of Hedonic Property Value Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 209-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper reports the results of a statistical summary of estimates of
 the marginal willingness to pay for reducing particulate matter from
 hedonic property value models developed between 1967 and 1988. Results
 from ordinary least squares and minimum absolute deviation estimators
 consider the effects of market conditions and the implementation
 procedures for hedonic models. The interquartile range for these estimated
 marginal values (measured as a change in asset prices) lies between zero
 and $98.52 (in 1982-84 dollars) for a one-unit reduction in total
 suspended particulates (in micrograms per cubic meter).  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Anarchy and Its Breakdown. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 26-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Anarchy, defined as a system in which participants can seize and defend
 resources without regulation from above, is not chaos but rather a
 spontaneous order. However, anarchy is fragile and may dissolve either
 into formless 'amorphy' or into a more organized system such as hierarchy.
 Under anarchy, each contestant balances between productive exploitation of
 the current resource base and fighting to acquire or defend resources.
 Anarchy is sustainable only when there are strongly diminishing returns to
 fighting effort (the decisiveness parameter is sufficiently low) and
 incomes exceed the viability minimum. These considerations explain many
 features of animal and human conflict.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Economics of Breakdowns, Checkups, and Cures. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 53-74
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  A market in which the owner of a durable good, X, contracts with an
 expert for diagnostic and treatment services is studied. Good X may be in
 one of three states: health, disease, or failure. Only experts can
 determine whether X is healthy or diseased and perform treatment. The
 owner cannot tell whether recommended treatment is really needed. This
 creates an information-based demand for health insurance by risk-neutral
 consumers. Imperfections in the market for spot insurance may give rise to
 free diagnostic checks, strategic procrastination, and long-term health
 maintenance agreements.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Income and Dividend Smoothing Based on Incumbency Rents. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 75-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Income smoothing is the process of manipulating the time profile of
 earnings or earnings reports to make the reported income stream less
 variable. This paper builds a theory of income smoothing based on the
 managers' concern about keeping their position or avoiding interference,
 and on the idea that current performance receives more weight than past
 performance when one is assessing the future. When investment is added to
 the model, so that income reports and dividends can be set independently,
 the authors find that both dividends and income reports may be smoothed
 and that dividends may convey information not present in the income
 report.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Market Frictions and Consumption-Based Asset Pricing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 94-117
Issue: 1
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  A fundamental equilibrium condition underlying most utility-based asset
 pricing models is the equilibration of intertemporal marginal rates of
 substitution. Previous empirical research, however, has found that the
 comovements of consumption and asset return data fail to satisfy the
 restrictions imposed by this equilibrium condition. In this paper, the
 authors examine whether market frictions can explain previous findings.
 Their results suggest that a combination of short-sale, borrowing,
 solvency, and trading cost frictions can drive a large enough wedge
 between intertemporal marginal rates of substitution so that the apparent
 violations may not be inconsistent with market equilibrium.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
