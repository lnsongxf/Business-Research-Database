Title:   The Selection Hypothesis and the Relationship between Trial and Plaintiff Victory. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 229-60
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper develops implications of the selection hypothesis of George L.
 Priest and Benjamin Klein (1984) for the relationship between trial rates
 and plaintiff win rates. The author finds strong evidence for the
 selection hypothesis in estimated relationships between trial rates and
 plaintiff win rates at trial across case types and judges. He then
 structurally estimates the model on judge data, yielding estimates of the
 model's major parameters (the decision standard, the degree of stake
 asymmetry, and the uncertainty parameter) for each of three major case
 types, contracts, property rights, and torts.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Price Elasticity of Hard Drugs: The Case of Opium in the Dutch East Indies, 1923-1938. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 261-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  At the beginning of this century, the Dutch government controlled the
 opium market in the Dutch East Indies--nowadays Indonesia--for several
 decades. This state monopoly was called the opiumregie. Using information
 gathered during the opiumregie, this paper estimates price elasticities of
 opium consumption. It appears that short-term price elasticities of opium
 use are about -0.7. Long-term price elasticities are about -1.0.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Wage Distribution in a Model of the Assignment of Skills to Jobs. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 280-315
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper discusses a general equilibrium model of the assignment of
 heterogeneous workers to heterogeneous jobs. Both jobs and workers are
 measured along a continuous one-dimensional scale. The composition of
 labor supply is represented by a distribution function. Highly skilled
 workers have an absolute advantage in all jobs and a comparative advantage
 in complex jobs. Equilibrium is characterized by a mapping of skills on
 complexities. The model is able simultaneously to explain the remuneration
 of skill, the allocation of skills to jobs, and variations in labor demand
 per job type. Estimation results for the Netherlands offer support for its
 relevance.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Can Imperfect Competition Explain the Difference between Primal and Dual Productivity Measures? Estimates for U.S. Manufacturing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 316-30
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  It is well known that, under the assumptions of constant returns to
 scale, perfect competition, and the absence of factor hoarding, primal and
 dual productivity measures should be highly correlated. The apparent lack
 of correlation is usually attributed to fixed factors of production. In
 this paper, the author proposes an alternative explanation by relaxing the
 assumption of perfect competition. By controlling for the presence of a
 markup component, the author demonstrates that both productivity measures
 are in fact highly correlated for U.S. manufacturing. The analysis also
 provides an alternative method of estimating a markup of prices over
 marginal cost.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Journals of Economics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 331-59
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the principal journals of economics, with particular
 attention to the communication between journals, as reflected by
 interjournal citations during 1987-90, and the changes over the past
 century in the characteristics of the authors and the techniques they have
 used. The numerical results, and those of the statistical modeling of
 these results, reinforce importance of economic theory as an exporter of
 intellectual influence to applied economics. The study examines the degree
 of specialization among different subfields of economics. A statistical
 model measures the flow of intellectual influence (as measured by
 citations) in terms of simple univariate scores.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Precautionary Saving and Social Insurance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 360-99
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper argues that a life cycle model can replicate observed patterns
 in household wealth accumulation after counting explicitly for
 precautionary saving and asset-based, means-tested social insurance. The
 authors demonstrate that social insurance programs with means tests based
 on assets discourage saving by households with low expected lifetime
 income. In addition, they evaluate the model using a dynamic programming
 model. Assuming common preference parameters across lifetime income
 groups, the authors are able to replicate the empirical pattern that
 low-income households are more likely than high-income households to hold
 virtually no wealth.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumer Rationality and Credit Cards. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 400-433
Issue: 2
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Borrowing on credit cards at high interest rates might appear irrational.
 However, even low transactions costs can make credit cards attractive
 relative to bank loans. Credit cards also provide liquidity services by
 allowing consumers to avoid some of the opportunity costs of holding
 money. The effect of alternative interest rates on the demand for card
 debits can explain why credit card interest rates only partially reflect
 changes in the cost of funds. Credit card interest rates that are
 inflexible relative to the cost of funds are not inconsistent with a
 competitive equilibrium that yields zero profits for the marginal entrant.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
