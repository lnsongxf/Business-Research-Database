Title:   Time-Consistent Health Insurance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 445-73
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Currently available health insurance contracts often fail to insure
 long-term illnesses: sick people can suffer large increases in premiums or
 denial of coverage. The author describes insurance contracts that solve
 this problem. Their key feature is a severance payment. A person who is
 diagnosed with a long-term illness and whose premiums are increased
 receives a lump sum equal to the increased present value of premiums. This
 lump sum allows him or her to pay the higher premiums required by any
 insurer. People are not tied to a particular insurer and they can pay the
 same premium as in standard contracts.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Macroeconomic Features of the French Revolution. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 474-518
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper describes aspects of the French Revolution from the
 perspective of theories about money and government budget constraints. The
 authors describe how unpleasant fiscal arithmetic gripped the Old Regime,
 how the Estates General responded to reorganize France's fiscal affairs,
 and how fiscal exigencies impelled the Revolution into a procession of
 monetary experiments ending in hyperinflation.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Growth Effects of Flat-Rate Taxes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 519-50
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Recent estimates of the potential growth effects of tax reform vary
 wildly, ranging from zero to eight percentage points. Using an endogenous
 growth model, the authors assess which model features and parameter values
 are important for determining the quantitative impact of tax reform. The
 quantitative estimates in several recent papers are compared with each
 other and with some of the evidence from U.S. experience. The authors find
 that Robert Lucas's conclusion, that tax reform would have little or no
 impact on the U.S. growth rate, is theoretically robust and consistent
 with the evidence.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effect of Marginal Tax Rates on Taxable Income: A Panel Study of the 1986 Tax Reform Act. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 551-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper uses a Treasury Department panel of more than 4,000 taxpayers
 to estimate the sensitivity of taxable income to changes in tax rates
 based on a comparison of the tax returns of the same individual taxpayers
 before and after the 1986 tax reform. The analysis emphasizes that the
 response of taxable income involves much more than a change in the
 traditional measures of labor supply. The evidence shows an elasticity of
 taxable income with respect to the marginal net-of-tax rate that is at
 least one and that could be substantially higher. The implications for
 recent tax rate changes are discussed.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Analytics of the Pricing of Higher Education and Other Services in Which the Customers Are Inputs. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 573-86
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Many services provide outputs that depend partially on the customers as
 inputs; the presence of other customers often contributes to the output
 experienced by each purchaser. Higher education is the premier example;
 others are legion. The authors provide a simple model that addresses the
 questions of competitive pricing and allocative efficiency for these types
 of services. Prices that charge customers for what they get on net (output
 minus input) from the firm both are competitive and support efficient
 allocations; these prices internalize the apparent external effects of
 customers on each other. Few examples of such prices exist in the real
 world.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Fiscal Effects of the Voter Initiative: Evidence from the Last 30 Years. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 587-623
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper compares the fiscal behavior of states with and without the
 voter initiative over the last thirty years. The main finding is that
 total spending was significantly lower in initiative states than in
 noninitiative states. Local spending was higher and state spending was
 lower in initiative states. On the revenue side, initiative states relied
 less on broad-based taxes and more on charges tied to services. Taken
 together, the evidence indicates that the initiative leads to a reduction
 in the overall size of government and suggests that it causes a decline in
 the level of redistributional activity.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Exchange Rate Dynamics Redux. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 624-60
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors develop an analytically tractable two-country model that
 marries a full account of global macroeconomic dynamics to a supply
 framework based on monopolistic competition and sticky nominal prices. The
 model offers simple and intuitive predictions about exchange rates and
 current accounts that sometimes differ sharply from those of either modern
 flexible-price intertemporal models or traditional sticky-price Keynesian
 models. The authors' analysis leads to a novel perspective on the
 international welfare spillovers due to monetary and fiscal policies.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Is the Japanese Extended Family Altruistically Linked? A Test Based on Engel Curves. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 661-74
Issue: 3
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Altruism has the well-known neutrality implication that the family's
 demand for commodities is invariant to the division of resources within
 the family. The author tests this by estimating Engel curves on a cross
 section of Japanese extended families forming two-generation households.
 He finds that the pattern of food expenditure is significantly affected by
 the division of resources. The food components whose budget share
 increases with the older generation's share of household income are
 precisely those favored by the old, such as cereal, seafood, and
 vegetables.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
