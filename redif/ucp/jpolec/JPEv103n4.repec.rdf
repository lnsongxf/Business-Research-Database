Abstract:
  When governments meet in the international arena, their actions reflect
 the political situations at home. Previous studies of trade relations have
 focused on governments that are immune from political pressures and that
 act as benevolent servants of the public interest. Here the authors
 introduce domestic politics into the analysis of international economic
 relations. They study the interactions between national leaders who are
 concerned with both providing a high standard of living to the general
 electorate and collecting campaign contributions from special-interest
 groups. The authors' analysis sheds light on the determinants of the
 structure of protection in noncooperative and cooperative policy
 equilibria.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Dynamic Income, Progressive Taxes, and the Timing of Charitable Contributions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 709-38
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Using an econometric model of charitable giving and a ten-year panel of
 tax return data, the author finds that previous studies have
 underestimated the effects of permanent income and overestimated those of
 permanent changes in tax prices. The significant statutory tax changes
 that occurred during the 1980s, especially in 1986, serve to identify the
 key model parameters. The author's results imply that people smooth their
 giving when transitory income changes but also time their giving to
 exploit transitory changes in tax prices. The results also raise questions
 about how effectively the tax incentives permanently influence the level
 of charitable giving by individuals.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rational Addiction with Learning and Regret. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 739-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors present a theory of rational behavior in which individuals
 maximize a set of stable preferences over goods with unknown addictive
 power. The theory is based on three fundamental postulates: consumption of
 the addictive good is not equally harmful to all, individuals possess
 subjective beliefs concerning this harm, and beliefs are optimally updated
 with information gained through consumption. Although individual actions
 are optimal and dynamically consistent, addicts regret their past
 consumption decisions and their initial assessment of the potential harm
 of the good. Addict-prone individuals who believe 'it could not happen to
 them' are most likely to be drawn into a harmful addiction.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   R&D-Based Models of Economic Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 759-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper argues that the 'scale effects' prediction of many recent
 R&D-based models of growth is inconsistent with the time-series evidence
 from industrialized economies. A modified version of the Romer model that
 is consistent with this evidence is proposed, but the extended model
 alters a key implication usually found in endogenous growth theory.
 Although growth in the extended model is generated endogenously through
 R&D, the long-run growth rate depends only on parameters that are usually
 taken to be exogenous, including the rate of population growth.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Coase versus Pacman: Who Eats Whom in the Durable-Goods Monopoly? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 785-812
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In standard durable-goods monopoly models, both the set of buyers and the
 set of prices are assumed to be continua. If the set of buyers is finite,
 the perfectly discriminating monopoly outcome is a unique subgame perfect
 equilibrium when the seller is sufficiently patient. Introducing instead a
 smallest unit of account yields the Coasian outcome as a generically
 unique subgame perfect equilibrium for patient enough buyers. A folk
 theorem is obtained if both sets are finite. These results reflect a
 strategic disadvantage of having to make moves with a large impact on
 other players' payoffs. The analysis is extended to durable-goods
 oligopoly.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Bait and Switch. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 813-30
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Sellers sometimes practice a form of false advertising known as bait and
 switch. A low-priced good is advertised but replaced by a different good
 at the showroom. The practice is surprising since advertising the wrong
 good discourages the appropriate buyers from shopping, attracting
 customers who will be disappointed when they see the good. Firms bait and
 switch to draw a greater number of shoppers. The cost is that some who
 would have bought the good that is for sale may not bother to look. Under
 a variety of conditions, bait and switch is a profitable strategy
 resulting in a fully rational equilibrium with false advertising.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Differential Interpretation of Public Signals and Trade in Speculative Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 831-72
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Most models of trade in speculative markets assume that agents interpret
 public information identically. The authors provide empirical evidence on
 the relation between the volume of trade and stock returns around public
 announcements, and they argue that the evidence is inconsistent with this
 assumption. They then develop a model of trade around public announcements
 that incorporates differential interpretations and is consistent with the
 observed volume-return relation. Then the authors test the standard model
 of belief revision underlying most models of trade using stock brokerage
 research analysts' earnings forecasts. The hypothesis of identical
 interpretations seems inconsistent with the forecast revisions in these
 data.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   China's Evolving Managerial Labor Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 873-92
Issue: 4
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Recent reforms of Chinese state-owned enterprises strengthened a nascent
 managerial labor market by incorporating incentives suggestive of
 competitive Western labor markets. Poorly performing firms were more
 likely to have a new manager selected by auction, to be required to post a
 higher security deposit, and to be subject to more frequent review of the
 manager's contract. Managers could be, and were, fired for poor
 performance. Managerial pay was linked to the firm's sales and profits,
 and reform strengthened the profit link and weakened the sales link. Thus,
 the economic reforms helped develop an improved system of managerial
 resource allocation responsive to market forces.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
