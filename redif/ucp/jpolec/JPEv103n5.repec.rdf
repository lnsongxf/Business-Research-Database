Title:   On the Turnover of Business Firms and Business Managers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1005-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model of small business failure and sale that is
 motivated by recent evidence concerning how the failure and sale of small
 businesses vary with the age of the business and the tenure of the
 manager. This evidence motivates two key features of the model: a match
 between the manager and the business, and characteristics of businesses
 that survive beyond the current match. The parameters of the model are
 estimated and the properties of this parametric model are studied. This
 analysis results in a simple characterization of the workings of the small
 business sector.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Endogenous Timing and the Clustering of Agents' Decisions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1039-66
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a model in which agents choose an action and a time
 at which to take the action. The authors show that, when agents choose
 when to act, their decisions become clustered together, giving the
 appearance of an information cascade even though information is actually
 being used efficiently. This occurs because the passage of time allows the
 first acting agent to anticipate something about the second agent's
 information and, for a large class of delay cost functions, the
 equilibrium orders agents in such a way that the most extreme information
 is revealed first.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Industrial Development in Cities. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1067-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper uses data for eight manufacturing industries to test for and
 characterize dynamic production externalities in cities. The authors find
 evidence of both Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) externalities, which are
 associated with past own industry employment concentration, and Jacobs
 externalities, which are associated with past diversity of local total
 employment. For mature capital goods industries, there is evidence of MAR
 externalities but none of Jacobs externalities. For new high-tech
 industries, there is evidence of Jacobs and MAR externalities. These
 findings are consistent with the notion that new industries prosper in
 large, diverse metropolitan areas but, with maturity, production
 decentralizes to smaller, more specialized cities.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Lessons from the Bell Curve. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1091-1120
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the argument presented in The Bell Curve. A central
 argument is that one factor--g--accounts for correlation across test
 scores and performance in society. Another central argument is that g
 cannot be manipulated. These arguments are combined to claim that social
 policies designed to improve social performance cannot be effective. A
 reanalysis of the evidence contradicts this story. The factors that
 explain wages receive different weights than the factors that explain test
 scores. More than g is required to explain either. Other factors besides g
 contribute to social performance and they can be manipulated.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Property Rights and Investment Incentives: Theory and Evidence from Ghana. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 903-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the link between property rights and investment
 incentives. The author develops three theoretical arguments based on
 security of tenure, using land as collateral and obtaining gains from
 trade. The paper then presents empirical evidence from two regions in
 Ghana. The author investigates the possibility that rights are endogenous,
 with farmers making improvements to enhance their land rights. Finally, he
 suggests tests for which of the theories might explain the results.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Economics of Polygyny in Sub-Saharan Africa: Female Productivity and the Demand for Wives in Cote d'Ivoire. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 938-71
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper makes the first attempt to link African polygny directly to
 the productivity of women in agriculture using micro data. The author
 develops a structural model of the demand for wives that disentangles
 wealth and substitution effects. Using a large household survey from the
 Ivory Coast, the author finds that marked geographic diversity in cropping
 patterns leads to regional variation in female labor productivity. The
 author also finds that, conditional on wealth, men do have more wives when
 women are more productive, that is, cheaper. This substitution effect may
 explain why polygyny declined in rural areas of the Ivory Coast during
 agricultural development.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Labor Contracts and Business Cycles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 972-1004
Issue: 5
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the claim that real business cycle models perform
 poorly in matching real-world aggregate labor market behavior because
 observed real wage payments do not correspond to the actual marginal
 productivity of labor but contain an insurance component not accounted for
 by the Walrasian pricing mechanism. We introduce contractual arrangements
 between employees and employers and use the theory of optimal contracts to
 derive an equilibrium relation between aggregate states of the we economy
 and wage-labor outcomes. This contractual arrangement is then embedded
 into a standard one-sector, stochastic neoclassical growth model in order
 to look at the business cycle implications of the contractual hypothesis.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
