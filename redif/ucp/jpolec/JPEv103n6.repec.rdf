Title:   Is Consumption Growth Consistent with Intertemporal Optimization? Evidence from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1121-57
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors show that some of the predictions of models of
 consumer intertemporal optimization are in line with the patterns of
 nondurable expenditure observed in U.S. household-level data. They propose
 a flexible specification of preferences that allows multiple commodities
 and yields empirically tractable equations. The authors estimate
 preference parameters using the only U.S. micro data set with complete
 consumption information. They show that previous rejections can be
 explained by the simplifying assumptions made in previous studies. The
 authors also show that results obtained using good consumption or
 aggregate data can be misleading.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Capital Income Taxation with Incomplete Markets, Borrowing Constraints, and Constant Discounting. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1158-75
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  For a wide class of infinitely lived agent models, Christophe Chamley
 (1986) has shown that the optimal capital income tax rate is zero in the
 long run. Robert E. Lucas (1990) has argued that, for the U.S. economy,
 there is a significant welfare gain from switching to this policy. This
 paper shows that, for the Bewley class of models with incomplete insurance
 markets and borrowing constraints, the optimal tax rate on capital income
 is positive, even in the long run. Therefore, cutting the capital income
 tax to zero may well lead to welfare losses.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Learning by Doing and Learning from Others: Human Capital and Technical Change in Agriculture.

Pages: 1176-1209
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995

Abstract:
  Household-level panel data from a nationally representative sample of
 rural Indian households describing the adoption and profitability of
 high-yielding seed varieties (HYVs) associated with the Green Revolution
 are used to test the implications of a model incorporating learning by
 doing and learning spillovers. The estimates indicate that imperfect
 knowledge about the management of the new seeds was a significant barrier
 to adoption; this barrier diminished as farmer experience with the new
 technologies increased; own experience and neighbors' experience with HYVs
 significantly increased HYV profitability; and farmers do not fully
 incorporate the village returns to learning in making adoption decisions.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On the Form of Transfers in Special Interests. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1210-35
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  An important question in political economy concerns the form of transfers
 to special interests. The Chicago view is that political competition leads
 politicians to make such transfers efficiently. The Virginia position is
 that lack of information on the part of voters leads politicians to favor
 inefficient 'sneaky' methods of redistribution. This paper analyzes the
 form of transfers in a model of political competition in which politicians
 have incentives to make transfers to special interests. It shows that,
 when voters have imperfect information about both the effects of policy
 and the predisposition of politicians, inefficient methods of
 redistribution may be employed.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Are Government Transfers Efficient? An Alternative Test of the Efficient Redistribution Hypothesis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1236-74
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The efficient redistribution hypothesis says that no available government
 policies are Pareto superior to observed government policies. Efficient
 redistribution from government policy is a central tenet of much recent
 theoretical and applied political economy literature. In this paper,
 limitations of previous attempts to test the efficient redistribution
 hypothesis are discussed and an alternative test of the efficient
 redistribution hypothesis that uses vector optimization theory and
 bootstrap methodology is presented.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Swords or Plowshares? A Theory of the Security of Claims to Property. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1275-88
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a general equilibrium model of the allocation of
 resources among appropriative and productive activities. The model
 emphasizes the distinction between offensive weapons, which are the
 instruments of predation, and fortifications, which provide defense
 against predation. The analysis of this model shows how the equilibrium
 security of claims to property is determined. The analysis focuses on the
 possibility of a nonaggressive equilibrium in which no resources are
 allocated to offensive weapons and claims to property are fully secure.
 The authors also analyze the complex relation between economic welfare and
 the security of claims to property.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Education and Income Growth: Implications for Cross-Country Inequality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1289-1301
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the extent to which patterns of human capital
 convergence can account for observed patterns of income inequality between
 countries. The author decomposes national income into three components:
 one due to education levels, one reflecting the return to education, and a
 residual component. He then examines the contribution of each to changes
 in income dispersion. Among the developed countries, convergence in
 education levels has resulted in a reduction in income dispersion.
 However, for the world as a whole, incomes have diverged despite
 substantial convergence in education levels.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Political Economy of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1302-42
Issue: 6
Volume: 103
Year: 1995
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the congressional passage of the Fair Labor Standards
 Act of 1938. Voting on it is modeled as a function of the concentration of
 the constituencies for minimum wage legislation, North-South
 differentials, and legislator ideology. The House radically altered the
 final content of the bill, abandoning a proposed Wages and Hours Board
 with discretionary powers to determine minimum wages in favor of a flat
 rate following the objections of several interest groups; North-South
 divisions over the bill had little influence over congressional voting;
 and the influence of constituent groups increased relative to legislators'
 ideology as the bill became an important election issue.  Copyright 1995 by University of Chicago Press.
