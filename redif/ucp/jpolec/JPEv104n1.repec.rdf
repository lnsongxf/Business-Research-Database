Title:   Optimal Debt Structure and the Number of Creditors. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Within an optimal contracting framework, the authors analyze the optimal
 number of creditors a company borrows from. They also analyze the optimal
 allocation of security interests among creditors and intercreditor voting
 rules that govern rule renegotiation of debt contracts. The key to the
 authors' analysis is the idea that these aspects of the debt structure
 affect the outcome of debt renegotiation following a default. Debt
 structures that lead to inefficient renegotiation are beneficial in that
 they deter default but they are also costly if default is beyond a
 manager's control. The optimal debt structure balances these effects.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Social Status, Education, and Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 108-32
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the implications of social rewards on the
 allocation of talent in society and consequently on the process of
 economic growth. The authors consider two sources of heterogeneity among
 workers: nonwage income and innate ability. A greater emphasis on status
 may induce the 'wrong' individuals, that is, those with low ability and
 high wealth, to acquire schooling, causing workers with high ability and
 low wealth to leave the growth-enhancing industries. This crowding-out
 effect, taken alone, discourages growth. Growth may be enhanced by a more
 egalitarian distribution of wealth, which reduces the demand for status.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Demand for Food and Calories. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 133-62
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors investigate nutrition and expenditure in rural Maharashtra in
 India. They estimate that the elasticity of calorie consumption with
 respect to total expenditure is 0.3-0.5, a range that is in accord with
 conventional wisdom. The elasticity declines only slowly with levels of
 living and is far from the value of zero suggested by a recent revisionist
 literature. In these Indian data, the calories necessary for a day's
 activity cost less than 5 percent of the daily wage, which makes it
 implausible that income is constrained by nutrition rather than the other
 way around.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Valuing Biodiversity for Use in Pharmaceutical Research. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 163-85
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  'Biodiversity prospecting' has been touted as a mechanism for both
 discovering new pharmaceutical products and saving endangered ecosystems.
 It is unclear what values may arise from such activities, however.
 Evidence from transactions is incomplete and existing theoretical models
 are flawed. The authors calculate an upper bound on the value of the
 'marginal species.' Even under favorable assumptions this bound is modest.
 Slightly modified assumptions lead to drastically lower estimates. The
 authors extend their findings to the value of the marginal hectare of
 habitat and find that the incentives for habitat conservation generated by
 private pharmaceutical research are also, at best, very modest.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Alaskan Labor Market during the Pipeline Era. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 186-218
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Built between 1974 and 1977, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was the largest
 privately financed construction project in world history. The Alaskan
 labor-market during the pipeline era provides an ideal opportunity to view
 labor market responses to a large, anticipated, and temporary shock to
 labor demand. The paper presents several theoretical models of market
 responses to temporary demand shocks and then assesses the ability of each
 model to explain the Alaskan data. Among the findings are that Alaskan
 wages were very flexible and labor supply was quite elastic on both the
 intensive (hours per worker) and extensive (number of workers) margins.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Daily Market for Federal Funds. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 26-56
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper reports overwhelming evidence against the hypothesis that the
 federal funds rate follows a martingale over the two-week reserve
 maintenance period, establishing that banks do not regard reserves held on
 different days of the week to be perfect substitutes. A theoretical model
 of the federal funds market is proposed that could account for these
 empirical regularities as the result of line limits, transaction costs,
 and weekend accounting conventions. The paper concludes that such
 transaction costs lie at the heart of the liquidity effect that enables
 the Federal Reserve to change the interest rate on a daily basis.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Public Provision of Private Goods. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 57-84
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Government may provide a good that can, if legally permitted, be
 supplemented by private purchases. Policy is determined by majority rule.
 Under standard assumptions on preferences, a majority voting equilibrium
 exists. A regime of positive government provision with no restriction on
 private supplements is shown to be majority preferred to a regime of
 either only market provision or only government provision. Combined public
 and private expenditure on the good is higher under this dual-provision
 regime than under either of the alternatives. Under some preference
 configurations, the median-income voter is pivotal; under others, a voter
 with income below the median is pivotal.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competition and the Core. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 85-107
Issue: 1
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Core theory is a powerful tool to find competitive market-clearing
 prices. A familiar economic setting shows this, beginning with a single
 commodity produced using many factors of production and ending with the
 general case of many outputs and inputs. The analysis describes when the
 market has a core. When it has no core, there is a least upper bound on
 the payment each firm that does not participate in a central market must
 make that serves as an inducement to restore the core. Each firm can avoid
 this penalty by trading in the central market, resulting in
 market-clearing prices.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
