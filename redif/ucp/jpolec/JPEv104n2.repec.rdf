Title:   Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Consumers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 219-40
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Empirical difficulties encountered by representative-consumer models are
 resolved in an economy with heterogeneity in the form of uninsurable,
 persistent, and heteroscedastic labor income shocks. Given the joint
 process of arbitrage-free labor prices, dividends, and aggregate income
 satisfying a certain joint restriction, it is shown that this process is
 supported in the equilibrium of an economy with judiciously modeled income
 heterogeneity. The Euler equations of consumption in a
 representative-agent economy are replaced by a set of Euler equations that
 depend not only on the per capita consumption growth but also on the
 cross-sectional variance of the individual consumers' consumption growth.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Localized Competition and the Aggregation of Plant-Level Increasing Returns: Blast Furnaces, 1929-1935. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 241-66
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A recent empirical literature has shaken economists' confidence in the
 value of aggregate (industry-level) data to illuminate production
 relationships. But the statistical finding 'you can't aggregate,' however
 well documented, is not an economic explanation. Plant-level relationships
 do aggregate in Depression-era blast furnace operations despite the
 presence of very substantial interplant heterogeneity, the most common
 economic cause of nonaggregability. The economic explanation of this lies
 in poor short-run substitutability of one plant's output for another's.
 Substitutability determines the importance of composition effects in
 understanding aggregate time series, constrains the potential cleansing
 effects of recessions, and therefore influences industry evolution quite
 broadly.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   What Can Explain the Apparent Lack of International Consumption Risk Sharing? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 267-97
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Recent research in international business cycles finds that international
 consumption comovements do not match the risk-sharing predictions of
 standard complete markets models. In this paper, the author asks whether
 two different types of explanations can help explain this result: (1)
 nonseparabilities between tradables and nontradable leisure or goods and
 (2) the effects of capital market restrictions on consumption risk
 sharing. She finds that risk sharing cannot be resolved by either
 explanation alone. However, when the author allows for both
 nonseparabilities and certain market restrictions, risk sharing among
 unrestricted countries cannot be rejected.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Understanding Risk and Return. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 298-345
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper uses an equilibrium multifactor model to interpret the
 cross-sectional pattern of postwar U.S. stock and bond returns. Priced
 factors include the return on a stock index, revisions in forecasts of
 future stock returns (to capture intertemporal hedging effects), and
 revisions in forecasts of future labor income growth (proxies for the
 return on human capital). Aggregate stock market risk is the main factor
 determining excess returns but, in the presence of human capital or stock
 market mean reversion, the coefficient of relative risk aversion is much
 higher than the price of stock market risk.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 346-97
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Two hypotheses concerning firms issuing debt for the first time are
 tested. The first is that new firms' debt is discounted more heavily by
 lenders compared to otherwise identical firms that have 'reputations' in
 the form of credit histories. The second hypothesis is that, prior to the
 establishment of a reputation, new firms issuing debt are monitored more
 intensely. The sample studied consists of new banks issuing bank notes for
 the first time during the American Free Banking Era (1838-60). The results
 explain why the pre-Civil War system of private money issuance by banks
 was not plagued by problems of overissuance ('wildcat banking').  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Tax Unit and Household Production. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 398-418
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that, on efficiency
 grounds, taxing individuals is always preferred to taxing households in a
 progressive income tax. The reason is that tax design affects the input of
 family members' time not only into market production and consumption of
 leisure but into household production as well. A simple numerical example
 is used to illustrate this possibility and a general equilibrium model
 calibrated to Australian data suggests that such a result can occur for
 actual tax structures in use.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Precautionary Saving, Insurance, and the Origins of Workers' Compensation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 419-42
Issue: 2
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  In this article, the authors test whether the introduction of social
 insurance has led to a reduction in private insurance purchases and
 precautionary saving by examining the introduction of workers'
 compensation. Their empirical analysis is based on the financial decisions
 of over 7,000 households surveyed for the 1917-19 Bureau of Labor
 Statistics cost-of-living study. The authors find that the presence of
 workers' compensation at least partially crowded out private accident
 insurance and led to a substantial reduction in precautionary saving. The
 introduction of workers' compensation caused private saving to fall by
 approximately 25 percent, with other factors held constant.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
