Title:   Evaluating the Effects of Incomplete Markets on Risk Sharing and Asset Pricing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 443-87
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors examine an economy with aggregate and idiosyncratic income
 risk in which agents cannot contract on future labor income. Agents trade
 financial securities to buffer idiosyncratic shocks but the extent of
 trade is limited by borrowing constraints and transactions costs. The
 effect of frictions on the equity premium is decomposed into two
 components: a direct effect due to the equation of net-of-costs margins
 and an indirect effect due to increased consumption volatility.
 Simulations suggest that the direct effect dominates and that the model
 predicts a sizable equity premium only if costs are large or the quantity
 of tradable assets is limited.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Real Exchange Rate Behavior: The Recent Float from the Perspective of the Past Two Centuries. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 488-509
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Using annual data spanning two centuries for dollar-sterling and
 franc-sterling real exchange rates, the authors find strong evidence of
 mean-reverting real exchange rate behavior. Using simple, stationary,
 autoregressive models estimated on prefloat data, they easily outperform
 nonstationary real exchange rate models in dynamic forecasting exercises
 over the recent float. Such stationary univariate equations explain 60-80
 percent of the in-sample variation in real exchange rates, although the
 degree of short-run persistence may be high. The econometric estimates
 imply a half-life of shocks to the real exchange rate of about six years
 for dollar-sterling and a little under three years for franc-sterling.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Behavior of the Exchange Rate in the Genetic Algorithm and Experimental Economies. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 510-41
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the behavior of the exchange rate in the
 Kareken-Wallace overlapping generations economy with two currencies in
 which decision rules are updated using the genetic algorithm. The analysis
 shows that a stationary monetary equilibrium of the Kareken-Wallace model
 is not stable under the genetic algorithm dynamics. The fluctuations in
 the genetic algorithm exchange rate are driven by fluctuations in the
 portfolio fractions, which change over time in response to the inequality
 between the rates of return on two currencies. Further, both the genetic
 algorithm simulations and the experiments with human subjects were
 characterized by continuing fluctuations of the exchange rate.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Culture, Information, and Screening Discrimination. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 542-71
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors show that discrimination can occur even when it is common
 knowledge that underlying group characteristics do not differ and
 employers do not prefer same-group candidates. When employers can judge
 job applicants' unknown qualities better when candidates belong to the
 same group and hire the best prospect from a large pool of applicants, the
 top applicant is likely to have the same background as the employer. The
 model has policy, empirical, and experimental implications. The model
 predicts that 'screening discrimination' is more likely to occur and
 persist in sectors in which underlying quality is important but difficult
 to observe.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Cross-Sectional Test of an Investment-Based Asset Pricing Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 572-621
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The author examines a factor pricing model for stock returns. The factors
 are returns on physical investment, inferred from investment data via a
 production function. The author examines the model's ability to explain
 variation in expected returns across assets and over time. The model is
 not rejected. It performs about as well as the CAPM and the Chen, Roll,
 and Ross (1986) factor model, and it performs substantially better than a
 simple consumption-based model. The author also provides an easy technique
 for estimating and testing dynamic, conditional asset pricing models--one
 simply includes factors and returns scaled by instruments in an
 unconditional estimate--and for comparing such models.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Dealer Price Discrimination in New Car Purchases: Evidence from the Consumer Expenditure Survey. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 622-54
Issue: 3
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper documents the variation in dealer discounts for new cars using
 transactions price data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
 Consumer-specific characteristics fail to explain dealer discounts,
 whereas model, market-specific, and purchase transaction variables (e.g.,
 first-time purchase, trade-in, and financing through dealer) do explain
 them. The results contradict earlier findings of race and gender
 discrimination based on a controlled experiment. This contradiction is
 reconciled by examining the higher moments of the empirical discount
 distribution; while mean and median markups do not vary by race and
 gender, minority purchases are characterized by higher dispersion.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
