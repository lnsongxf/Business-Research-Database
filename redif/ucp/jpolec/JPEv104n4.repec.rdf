Title:   Consumers' Evaluation of New Products: Learning from Self and Others. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 683-703
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  When offered a new product whose attributes are unknown, customers can
 determine whether they like the product by trying it themselves or can
 wait to observe the experience of other customers who try the product. The
 authors specify a rational decision process and investigate the
 implications of learning from others on the sales of new products and the
 impact of advertising.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Role of Countercyclical Monetary Policy. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 704-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  When firms set nominal prices in advance, optimal monetary policy
 insulates aggregate output against shocks to demand. It can do so,
 however, by following the constant money growth rule advocated by Milton
 Friedman; it need not respond to the shocks in an actively countercyclical
 way. In addition, to the extent that output fluctuations are driven by
 shocks to supply, money growth should be procyclical.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competition and Corporate Performance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 724-46
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Are people right to think that competition improves corporate
 performance? The author's investigations indicate first that there are
 some theoretical reasons for believing this hypothesis to be correct but
 they are not overwhelming. Furthermore, the existing empirical evidence on
 this question is weak. However, the results reported here, based on the
 analysis of around 670 U.K. companies, provide some support for this view.
 Most important, the author presents evidence that competition, as measured
 by increased numbers of competitors or by lower levels of rents, is
 associated with a significantly higher rate of total factor productivity
 growth.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Willingness to Pay and the Distribution of Risk and Wealth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 747-63
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Willingness-to-pay is an appropriate benefits metric for government
 expenditure and regulatory policies that reduce risks to human life. It
 depends, however, on the distribution of risk and wealth. Currently,
 society's expenditures overemphasize concentrated risks, say
 after-the-fact treatment as opposed to prevention. A 'dead-anyway' effect
 complements excess attention to intense interests in explaining this. The
 normative criterion for spending on risk reduction is what a rational,
 albeit uninsured, individual confronting lotteries on future risks to life
 and wealth would choose for himself. This requires correcting
 willingness-to-pay to eliminate the dead-anyway effect but continues to
 reflect that wealth enhances the utility of living.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   How Does Privatization Work? Evidence from the Russian Shops. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 764-90
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors use a survey of 452 Russian shops, most of which were
 privatized between 1992 and 1993, to measure the importance of alternative
 channels through which privatization promotes restructuring. Restructuring
 is measured as major renovation, a change in suppliers, an increase in the
 hours stores stay open, and layoffs. There is strong evidence that the
 presence of new owners and new managers raises the likelihood of
 restructuring. In contrast, there is no evidence that equity incentives of
 old managers promote restructuring. The evidence points to the critical
 role new human capital plays in economic transformation.   Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   International Differences in Male Wage Inequality: Institutions versus Market Forces. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 791-836
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the considerably higher level of wage inequality in
 the United States than in nine other OECD countries. The authors find that
 the greater overall U.S. wage dispersion primarily reflects substantially
 more compression at the bottom of the wage distribution in the other
 countries. While differences in the distribution of measured
 characteristics help to explain some aspects of the international
 differences, higher U.S. prices (i.e., rewards to skills and rents) are an
 important factor. Labor market institutions, chiefly the relatively
 decentralized wage-setting mechanisms in the United States, provide the
 most persuasive explanation for these patterns.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Learning, Wage Dynamics, and Firm-Specific Human Capital. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 838-68
Issue: 4
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors introduce a dynamic and fully strategic model of wage
 determination in the presence of firm-specific human capital. In this
 model, human capital is interpreted as information. The authors show that
 equilibrium exists and is efficient and that it gives rise to a unique
 distribution of the social surplus. They show further that the equilibrium
 wage is determined by three factors. Consideration of these factors allows
 the authors to determine when and how the market mechanism enables the
 worker to capture some of the returns to firm-specific human capital. They
 relate their findings to the ongoing empirical debate concerning the
 return to tenure.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
