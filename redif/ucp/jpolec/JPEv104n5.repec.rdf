Title:   Gender, Agricultural Production, and the Theory of the Household. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1010-46
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Virtually all models of the household assume that the allocation of
 resources is Pareto efficient. Within many African households,
 agricultural production occurs on many plots controlled by different
 members of the household. Pareto efficiency implies that factors should be
 allocated efficiently across these plots. The author finds, in contrast,
 that plots controlled by women are farmed much less intensively than
 similar plots within the household controlled by men. The estimates imply
 that about 6 percent of output is lost because of inefficient factor
 allocation within the household. The paper suggests a new approach to
 modeling intrahousehold allocation consistent with the empirical results.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Equilibrium Income Inequality among Identical Agents. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1047-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The paper offers a theory of income differences in which income
 inequality exists and persists despite identical tastes and talents. Teams
 of unskilled labor supervised by schooled managers produce goods with
 increasing returns to scale. Agents are assumed unable to borrow to fund
 the human capital investment needed to become managers. Despite ex ante
 identical agents, the model displays the following equilibrium phenomena:
 (1) risk-averse agents accept fair gambles, implying an unequal ex post
 distribution of unearned income; (2) agents agree to publicly subsidize
 education, although those receiving the subsidy have the highest material
 wealth; and (3) incomes and educational differences are perpetuated from
 generation to generation.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Measurement Matters: Recent Results from Monetary Economics Reexamined. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1065-83
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Inferences about the effects of money on economic activity may depend
 importantly on the choice of a monetary index because simple-sum
 aggregates cannot internalize pure substitution effects. This hypothesis
 is investigated by replicating five recent studies that have challenged an
 aspect of the 'conventional wisdom' about the effects of money on
 aggregate activity. In four of the five cases, the qualitative inference
 in the original study is reversed when a simple-sum monetary aggregate is
 replaced by a Divisia index of the same asset collection. The results are
 mixed in the fifth case.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Role of Premarket Factors in Black-White Wage Differences. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 869-95
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors regress young adult wages on current age and the score of a
 basic skills test that was administered over ten years earlier, when
 respondents were preparing to leave high school and embark on work careers
 or postsecondary education. Controlling for this one measure of premarket
 skill greatly reduces the measured black-white wage gap for young adults.
 The authors' results suggest that the black-white wage gap primarily
 reflects a black-white skill gap that exists before young men and women
 enter the labor market. This skill gap in part reflects measured
 black-white differences in wealth and family background.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competitive Storage and Commodity Price Dynamics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 896-923
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  By buying cheap and selling dear, risk-neutral commodity speculators can
 smooth commodity prices and induce serial dependence in price even when
 none would exist under a simple process of supply and demand. Commodity
 prices are variable and strongly positively correlated from one year to
 the next. The variability is often explained by supply factors and the
 autocorrelation by the activities of speculators. The authors show that
 this explanation is not consistent with the evidence. Speculation can
 substantially increase autocorrelation for prices that are weakly
 autocorrelated in its absence but not to the high levels that are observed
 in the data.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Commodity Price Fluctuations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 924-57
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the price fluctuations of storable commodities that
 are traded in open markets and are subject to random shocks to demand or,
 more particularly, to supply. It relaxes the common assumption that the
 shocks are identically and independently distributed in favor of
 temporally dependent and periodic disturbances. The existence of a unique
 stationary rational expectations equilibrium is demonstrated for each of
 the models analyzed and testable implications of the models are derived.
 An illustrative empirical investigation is then undertaken for the model
 with periodic disturbances using monthly time-series observations for
 seven commodities over the period 1960-93.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Favoritism in Organizations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 958-78
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Objective measures of employee performance are rarely available. Instead,
 firms rely on subjective judgments by supervisors. Subjectivity opens the
 door to favoritism, where evaluators act on personal preferences toward
 subordinates to favor some employees over others. Firms must balance the
 costs of favoritism--arbitrary rewards and less productive job
 assignments--against supervisors' demands for authority over subordinates.
 The authors analyze the conditions under which favoritism is costly to
 organizations and the effects of favoritism on compensation, the optimal
 extent of authority, and the use of bureaucratic rules.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Federal Fiscal Constitutions: Risk Sharing and Redistribution. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 979-1009
Issue: 5
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the political and economic determinants of regional
 public transfers. Specifically, it focuses on how such transfers are
 shaped by alternative fiscal constitutions, where a constitution is an
 allocation of fiscal instruments across different levels of governments
 plus a procedure for the collective choice of these instruments. Realistic
 restrictions on fiscal instruments introduce a trade-off between risk
 sharing and redistribution. Different constitutions produce very different
 results. In particular, a federal social insurance scheme, chosen by
 voting, provides overinsurance, whereas an intergovernmental transfer
 scheme, chosen by bargaining, provides underinsurance.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
