Title:   Impetuous Youngsters and Jaded Old-Timers: Acquiring a Reputation for Learning. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1105-34
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines individual decision making when decisions reflect on
 people's ability to learn. The authors address this problem in the context
 of a manager making investment decisions on a project over time. They show
 that, in an effort to appear as a fast learner, the manager will
 exaggerate his own information but ultimately he becomes too conservative,
 being unwilling to change his investments on the basis of new information.
 The authors' results arise purely from learning about competence rather
 than concavity or convexity of the rewards functions. They relate their
 results to the existing psychology literature concerning cognitive
 dissonance reduction.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Monetary Explanation of the Equity Premium, Term Premium, and Risk-Free Rate Puzzles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1135-71
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper develops and estimates a monetary model that offers an
 explanation of some puzzling features of observed returns on equities and
 default-free bonds. The key feature of the model is that some assets other
 than money play a special role in facilitating transactions. The model is
 capable of producing a low risk-free rate, a high equity premium, and an
 average positive relationship between maturity and term premium for
 default-free bonds. The model's implications for the joint distribution of
 asset returns, velocity, inflation, money growth, and consumption growth
 are also compared to the behavior of these variables in the U.S. economy.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Credit, Incentives, and Reputation: A Hedonic Analysis of Contractual Wage Profiles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1172-1226
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A hedonic analysis of principal-agent employment contracts is developed,
 in which workers and employers exchange labor services and contractual
 payment patterns, and is applied to contract data from a household-level
 survey in rural China in 1935. The results indicate that credit-market
 constraints motivated workers' and employers' contract choices; that
 shirking by workers rather than by employers was the dominant incentive
 issue; that reputational concerns rather than threats of termination were
 the key worker-disciplining device; and, finally, that a contract's third
 party acted as an enforcement device rather than as a matchmaker.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Relative Wage Movements and the Distribution of Consumption. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1227-62
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze how relative wage movements among birth cohorts and
 education groups affected the distribution of household consumption and
 economic welfare. Their empirical work draws on the best available
 cross-sectional data sets to construct synthetic panel data on U.S.
 consumption, labor supply, and wages during the 1980s. The authors find
 that low-frequency movements in the cohort-education structure of pretax
 hourly wages among men drove large changes in the distribution of
 household consumption. The results constitute a spectacular failure of
 between-group consumption insurance, a failure not explained by existing
 theories of informationally constrained optimal consumption behavior.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Saving Babies: The Efficacy and Cost of Recent Changes in the Medicaid Eligibility of Pregnant Women. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1263-96
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors provide direct evidence on the effect of health insurance on
 health outcomes by examining the dramatic increases in the eligibility of
 pregnant women for the Medicaid program between 1979 and 1992. They find
 that the 30-percentage-point rise in Medicaid eligibility significantly
 lowered the incidence of low birth weight and infant mortality. Targeted
 changes in Medicaid eligibility that were restricted to specific
 low-income groups had much larger effects on birth outcomes than broader
 expansions of eligibility to women with higher income levels because of
 much lower take-up of this entitlement by the latter group.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Old Lady Visits Your Backyard: A Tale of Morals and Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1297-1313
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Local opposition to many projects makes it increasingly difficult to find
 sites for socially desirable facilities. As has been widely documented,
 compensation for local disamenities does not increase the level of
 support. An empirical analysis of the Swiss search for a nuclear waste
 repository even reveals decreased acceptance due to the rejection of
 bribes and the crowding-out of public spirit. However, a 'compensation
 cycle' may be exploited to finally win the support of host communities. As
 siting issues are decided in the realm of politics, an economic theory of
 compensation must focus on the interplay between morals and markets.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Informal Regulation of Industrial Pollution in Developing Countries: Evidence from Indonesia. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1314-27
Issue: 6
Volume: 104
Year: 1996
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  When formal regulation is weak or absent, communities often use other
 channels to induce pollution abatement by local factories in a process of
 'informal regulation.' The resulting 'pollution equilibrium' reflects the
 relative bargaining power of the community and the plant. This note uses
 Indonesian data from 1989-90 on plant-level organic water pollution to
 test the informal regulation hypothesis.  Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press.
