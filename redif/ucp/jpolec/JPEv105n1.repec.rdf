Title:   Formal and Real Authority in Organizations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-29
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a theory of the allocation of formal and real
 authority within organizations. Real authority is determined by the
 structure of information, which in turn depends on the allocation of
 formal authority. An increase in an agent's real authority promotes
 initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. The paper
 analyzes the allocation of formal authority as well as some determinants
 of the subordinates' real authority: overload, lenient rules, urgency of
 decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of
 superiors. Finally, the amount of communication in an organization is
 shown to depend on the allocation of formal authority.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Bargaining over Governments in a Stochastic Environment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 101-31
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the author structurally estimates a stochastic bargaining
 model of government formation in a multiparty parliamentary democracy and
 he conducts policy experiments to evaluate the effects of changes in the
 bargaining procedure. The author shows that the model fits data on the
 duration of negotiations and government durations in postwar Italy well.
 Also, he shows that changes in the proposer selection process would not
 affect either the duration of negotiations or government durations,
 whereas the imposition of a strict deadline would in general reduce the
 incentives to delay agreement as well as government durations.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Relative Price Variability and Inflation: Evidence from U.S. Cities. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 132-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors test whether the time-series positive correlation of
 inflation and intermarket relative price variability is also present in a
 cross section of U.S. cities. They find this correlation to be a robust
 empirical regularity: cities that have higher than average inflation also
 have higher than average relative price dispersion, ceteris paribus. This
 result holds for different periods of time, for different classes of
 goods, and across different time horizons. The authors' results suggest
 that at least part of the relationship between inflation and relative
 price variability cannot be explained by monetary factors.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Chicago, Harvard, and the Doctrinal Foundations of Monetary Economics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 153-77
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The relationship between Milton Friedman's monetary economics and the
 views espoused by Chicago and non-Chicago quantity theorists in 1930-36 is
 examined. Contrary to recent interpretations, Chicago economists advanced
 the efficacy of monetary policy as the means of escaping from the Great
 Depression if such a policy was implemented with budget deficits to
 generate monetary expansion. The use of the quantity theory of money to
 provide a theoretical rationale for budget deficits distinguished the
 Chicago economists from other quantity theorists and left them less
 susceptible to the Keynesian revolution. The claim that Harvard was an
 important center for monetary research in the early 1930s is refuted.	 Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Impact of Federal Spending on House Election Outcomes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 30-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Previous empirical studies have found little evidence that voters reward
 incumbent members of Congress for bringing federal dollars to their
 district. One explanation for these findings is that incumbents who are in
 danger of losing reelection exert more effort to obtain federal funds. To
 address that issue, this paper uses federal spending outside the district
 but inside the state as an instrument for spending in the district. In
 contrast to previous studies, the authors find strong evidence that
 federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional $100 per
 capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.	 Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Effect of the Expansion of the Voting Franchise on the Size of Government. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 54-82
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the claim that expansion of the voting franchise has
 been an important factor in the growth of government. State government
 spending and state and local spending are explained using a panel of
 forty-six states for 1950-88. Elimination of poll taxes and literacy tests
 led to higher turnout, particularly among the poor, and a poorer pivotal
 voter. As predicted, the authors find that these changes, a fall in the
 income of voters relative to state income, and the ouster of Republicans
 from state government led to a sharp rise in welfare spending but no
 change in other spending.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Prices versus Quantities: The Political Perspective. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 83-100
Issue: 1
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Regulation regimes subject to the influence of interest groups are
 compared. It is shown that the allocation of the regulated commodity
 varies with the implemented control and that the advantage of prices
 (versus quotas) increases with the elasticity of the demand for or the
 supply of the commodity and decreases with the number of organized
 producers in the regulated industry. Control regimes can be ranked for
 negative, but not positive, externalities. Finally, a control regime
 leading to a more efficient commodity allocation also entails using fewer
 resources in rent-seeking activities.	 Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
