Title:   Credit Cycles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 211-48
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a model of a dynamic economy in which lenders
 cannot force borrowers to repay their debts unless the debts are secured.
 In such an economy, durable assets play a dual role: not only are they
 factors of production but they also serve as collateral for loans. The
 dynamic interaction between credit limits and asset prices turns out to be
 a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist,
 amplify, and spill over to other sectors. The authors show that small,
 temporary shocks to technology or income distribution can generate large,
 persistent fluctuations in output and asset prices.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Returns to Scale in U.S. Production: Estimates and Implications. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 249-83
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A typical two-digit industry in the United States appears to have
 approximately constant returns to scale. Three puzzles emerge, however.
 First, estimates rise at higher levels of aggregation. Second, apparent
 decreasing returns contradicts evidence of small economic profits. Third,
 estimates with value added differ substantially from those with gross
 output. A representative-firm paradigm cannot explain these puzzles but a
 simple story of aggregation over heterogeneous units can. The authors
 discuss implications of heterogeneity for calibrating one-sector
 macroeconomic models, showing that these models sometimes require
 firm-level parameters but at other times require the 'biased' aggregate
 parameters.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Turnaround Time and Bottlenecks in Market Clearing: Decentralized Matching in the Market for Clinical Psychologists. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 284-329
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The potential transactions evaluated in labor markets before equilibrium
 is identified involve rejected offers. After an initial phase in which
 many offers can be made simultaneously, a new offer cannot be made until
 an outstanding offer is rejected, so even a small time required to process
 offers and rejections may cause bottlenecks. In many labor markets, this
 means that transactions have to be finalized before the market clears. A
 firm needs to consider the likelihood that its offer will be accepted,
 since if its offer is rejected other potential employees may become
 unavailable in the interim. The analysis is carried out in connection with
 the market for clinical psychologists.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Do Meetings in Smoke-Filled Rooms Facilitate Collusion? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 330-50
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The Sherman Act prohibits firms from discussing prices in meetings.
 Traditional thought suggests that this prohibition makes it harder for
 firms to collude, and economists have concluded that the Sherman Act
 operates in the public interest. The author provides an alternative
 explanation for the act that also accounts for the small sanctions chosen
 by the legislature. When firms interact in a dynamic environment in which
 the law helps them to prevent renegotiation, the firms may benefit from
 the law that makes it costly, but not very costly, to meet to discuss
 prices. The Sherman Act may help firms to collude.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Local Property and State Income Taxes: The Role of Interjurisdictional Competition and Collusion. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 351-84
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper addresses two long-standing positive questions in public
 finance: why is the property tax, despite widespread popular complaints
 against its fairness, the almost exclusive tax instrument used by local
 governments and why do we consistently observe higher levels of
 governments (states) undermining local property tax systems through income
 tax-funded grants and state-imposed caps on local property tax rates?
 Results indicate that setting local income tax rates to zero is a dominant
 strategy for communities that face competition from neighboring
 governments and that only through higher government intervention can local
 income taxes be introduced.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Competitive Search Equilibrium. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 385-411
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the author constructs an equilibrium for markets with
 frictions, which is competitive in the sense that all agents are price
 takers and maximize utility subject to a set of market parameters. He
 shows that the equilibrium can be achieved if employers with vacancies can
 advertise publicly the wages they pay.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Optimal Unemployment Insurance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 412-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the design of an optimal unemployment insurance
 system. The problem is modeled as a repeated principal-agent problem
 involving a risk-averse agent--the unemployed worker--and a risk-neutral
 principal, which cannot montor the agent's search effort. The optimal
 long-term contract involves a replacement ratio that decreases throughout
 the unemployment spell and a wage tax after reemployment that, under some
 mild regularity conditions, increases with the lenght of the unemployment
 spell. Some numerical results suggest that the gains from switching to
 this optimal unemployment insurance scheme could be quite large. The
 performance of this optimal contract is also compared to alternative
 liquidity provision mechanisms.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
