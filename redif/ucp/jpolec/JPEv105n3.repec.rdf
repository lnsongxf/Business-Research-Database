Title:   Postwar British Economic Growth and the Legacy of Keynes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 439-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Following John Maynard Keynes's recommendations, Britain taxed capital
 income at a much higher rate than the United States during the war and for
 much of the postwar period. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of
 the policies designed by Keynes using an endogenous growth model and the
 neoclassical growth model. The implications of tax-smoothing policies are
 also evaluated. The authors find that the welfare costs of Keynes's
 policies were very high relative to a tax-smoothing policy and argue that
 Britain's poor macroeconomic performance in the early postwar period
 reflects the high tax rates levied on capital income.	 Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Career Decisions of Young Men. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 473-522
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper provides structural estimates of a dynamic model of schooling,
 work, and occupational choice decisions based on eleven years of
 observations on a sample of young men from the 1979 youth cohort of the
 National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY). The
 authors find that a suitably extended human capital investment model can
 in fact do an excellent job of fitting observed data on school attendance,
 work, occupational choices, and wages in the NLSY data on young men and
 also produces reasonable forecasts of future work decisions and wage
 patterns.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Financial Markets, Intermediaries, and Intertemporal Smoothing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 523-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In an overlapping generations economy with (incomplete) financial markets
 but no intermediaries, there is underinvestment in safe assets. In an
 economy with intermediaries and no financial markets, accumulating
 reserves of save assets allows returns to be smoothed, nondiversifiable
 risk to be eliminated, and an ex ante Pareto improvement compared to the
 allocation in the market equilibrium to be achieved. In a mixed financial
 system, however, competition from financial markets constrains
 intermediaries so that they perform no better than markets alone.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Performance Comparisons and Dynamic Incentives. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 547-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  It is well known that comparative performance information can enhance
 efficiency in static principal-agent relationships by improving the
 trade-off between insurance and incentives in the design of explicit
 contracts. In dynamic settings, however, there may be implicit as well as
 explicit incentives, for example, managerial career concerns and the
 ratchet effects in regulation. The authors show that the dynamic effects
 of comparative performance information on implicit incentives can either
 reinforce or oppose the familiar (static) insurance effect and in either
 case can be more important for efficiency. The overall welfare effects of
 comparative performance information are thus ambiguous and can be
 characterized in terms of the underlying information structure.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Unemployment, Migration, and Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 582-608
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Economic development is typically accompanied by migration from rural to
 urban employment. This migration is often associated with significant
 urban underemployment. Both factors are important in the development
 process. The authors consider a neoclassical growth model with rural-urban
 migration and urban underemployment, which arises from an adverse
 selection problem in labor markets. They demonstrate that rural-urban
 migration and underemployment can be a source of development traps and can
 give rise to a large set of periodic equilibria displaying undamped
 oscillation. Many such equilibria display long periods of uninterrupted
 growth, punctuated by brief but severe recessions.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Are Hypothetical Referenda Incentive Compatible? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 609-21
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Hypothetical referenda have been proposed as an incentive-compatible
 mechanism that can be used to obtain social valuations of environmental
 resources. The authors employ experimental methods to test the hypothesis
 that such referenda are indeed incentive compatible. Their results lead
 them to reject that hypothesis. Coauthors are Steven Elliott, Glenn W.
 Harrison, and James Murphy.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Role of Markets in Reducing Expected Utility Violations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 622-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Market theories assume that expected utility predicts preferences at the
 market level even as evidence mounts that it predicts poorly at the
 individual level. The arguments for better-performing markets are grounded
 in the assumption that individuals respond to the competition of the
 market. The objective of this study is to test empirically the validity of
 those assumptions using the betweenness property of expected utility. The
 author concludes that expected utility does indeed predict better in
 markets but analyses suggest that improved performance may be due to the
 statistical role played by markets introduced by market price selection
 rules.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
