Title:   Bidder Collusion at Forest Service Timber Sales. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 657-99
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Allegations of bidder collusion at Forest Service timber sales in the
 Pacific Northwest were common in the 1970s. Of course, prices may be low
 for reasons other than collusion. The authors formulate an empirical model
 that allows for both bidder collusion and supply effects and in which they
 control for demand conditions. Noncooperative behavior in which a single
 unit is sold (the standard auction model) is a special case: it is found
 to be definitively outperformed by a model of collusion. The authors also
 find that supply effects are dominated by collusion in determining the
 winning bids in the market.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Contracts and Money. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 700-708
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Why are contracts not fully indexed? In a setting in which fully indexed
 contracts are feasible, the authors find that, when price-level data are
 gathered with delay, these contracts are not renegotiation-proof. The
 contracts that replace them entail a lower level of welfare for the
 parties to that contract. They also imply that real variables respond to
 nominal shocks.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Was Prometheus Unbound by Chance? Risk, Diversification, and Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 709-51
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper offers a theory of development that links the degree of market
 incompleteness to capital accumulation and growth. Because sectoral
 indivisibilities limit the extent of diversification, poor economies
 suffer higher volatility of growth and endogenously lower productivity. As
 the economy develops, agents hold more balanced portfolios and can take
 better advantage of high-return production opportunities. Although all
 agents are price takers and there are no technological spillovers, the
 decentralized equilibrium is inefficient because individuals do not
 internalize the impact of their investment decisions on others'
 diversification opportunities. The results generalize to economies with
 international capital flows.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Common Agency and Coordination: General Theory and Application to Government Policy Making. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 752-69
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a model of common agency with complete information
 and general preferences with nontransferable utility, and they prove that
 the principals' Nash equilibrium in truthful strategies implements an
 efficient action. The authors apply this theory to the construction of a
 positive model of public finance, where organized special interests can
 lobby the government for consumer and producer taxes or subsidies and
 targeted lump-sum taxes or transfers. The lobbies use only the
 nondistorting transfers in their noncooperative equilibrium, but their
 intergroup competition for transfers turns into a prisoners' dilemma in
 which the government captures all the gain that is potentially available
 to the parties.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Intertemporal Cost Allocation and Managerial Investment Incentives: A Theory Explaining the Use of Economic Value Added as a Performance Measure. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 770-95
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a formal analysis of how managerial investment
 incentives are affected by alternative allocation rules when managerial
 compensation is based on accounting measures of income that include
 allocations for investment expenditures. The main result is that there
 exists a unique allocation rule that always induces the manager to choose
 the efficient investment level. The income measure created by this
 allocation rule is usually referred to as residual income or economic
 value added.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Information Management in Incentive Problems. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 796-821
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors extend the standard procurement model to examine how an agent
 is optimally induced to acquire valuable planning information before he
 chooses an unobservable level of cost-reducing effort. Information
 acquisition concerns cause important changes in standard incentive
 contracts. Reward structures with extreme financial payoffs arise and
 super-high-powered contracts are coupled with contracts that entail
 pronounced cost sharing. However, if the principal can assign the planning
 and production tasks to two different agents, then all contracting
 distortions disappear and, except for forgone economies of scope, the
 principal achieves her most preferred outcome.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Principles of Exchange Rate Determination in an International Financial Experiment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 822-61
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper reports the first experiments designed to explore the behavior
 of economies with prominent features of international finance. Two
 'countries,' each with its own currency, were created. International trade
 could take place only through the operation of markets for currency.
 Prices of goods, as well as the exchange rate, evolve over time toward the
 predictions of the competitive general equilibrium model. However, both
 the law of one price and purchasing power parity can be rejected for
 reasons that do not appear in the literature. Patterns of international
 trade were as predicted by the law of comparative advantage.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Transactions Costs and Nonlinear Adjustment in Real Exchange Rates: An Empirical Investigation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 862-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Equilibrium models of real exchange rate determination in the presence of
 transactions costs imply a nonlinear adjustment process toward purchasing
 power parity (PPP). Conventional cointegration tests, which ignore the
 effect of transactions costs, may be biased against the long-run PPP
 hypothesis. The authors' results, using both monthly data for the interwar
 period and annual data spanning two countries, clearly reject the linear
 framework in favor of an exponential smooth transition autoregressive
 process. The systematic pattern in the estimates of the nonlinear models
 provides strong evidence of mean-reverting behavior for PPP deviations and
 helps explain the mixed results of previous studies.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
