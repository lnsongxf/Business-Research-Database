Title:   Does Competition Kill Corruption? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1001-23
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Corrupt agents (officials or gangsters) exact money from firms.
 Corruption affects the number of firms in a free-entry equilibrium. The
 degree of deep competition in the economy increases with lower overhead
 costs relative to profits and with a tendency toward similar cost
 structures. Increases in competition may not lower corruption. The model
 explains why a rational corrupt agent may extinguish the source of his
 bribe income by causing a firm to exit. Assessing the welfare effect of
 corruption is complicated by the fact that exit caused by corruption does
 not necessarily reduce social welfare.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Noise Trading, Delegated Portfolio Management, and Economic Welfare. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1024-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors consider a model of the stock market with delegated portfolio
 management. Portfolio managers try, but sometimes fail, to discover
 profitable trading opportunities. Although it is best not to trade in this
 case, their clients cannot distinguish 'actively doing nothing,' in this
 sense, from 'simply doing nothing.' The authors show that some portfolio
 managers trade even though they have no reason to prefer one asset to
 another (noise trade); the amount of such noise trade can be large
 compared to the amount of hedging volume; and, perhaps surprisingly, noise
 trade may be Pareto improving.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Critical Evidence on Comparative Advantage? North-North Trade in a Multilateral World. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1051-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  There are two principal theories of why countries trade: comparative
 advantage and increasing returns to scale. Which is most important in
 practice? The large volume of intra-OECD trade is frequently cited as
 critical evidence on this question. It is argued that comparative
 advantage, unlike scale economies, is incapable of accounting for the
 large volume of trade between seemingly similar economies. This is a
 theoretical claim. In this paper, the author shows that it is possible to
 give an account of this trade based on comparative advantage. The elements
 that may give rise to a large volume of North-North trade are traced to
 identifiable features of technology and endowments.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Scale Economies, the Value of Time, and the Demand for Money: Longitudinal Evidence from Firms. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1061-79
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  COMPUSTAT data on 12,000 firms for the years 1961-92 indicate that large
 firms hold less cash as a percentage of sales than small ones. Whether
 comparisons are made within or across industries, the elasticity of cash
 balances with respect to sales is about 0.8. Firms headquartered in
 countries with high wages hold more money for a given level of sales, a
 finding consistent with the idea that time can substitute for money in the
 provision of transactions services. The estimates are consistent with both
 scale economies in the holding of money and secular declines in velocity.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   The Impact of Economic Reform on the Performance of Chinese State Enterprises, 1980-1989. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1080-1106
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The effectiveness of China's incremental industrial reform between 1980
 and 1989 is investigated using a panel data set of 272 state enterprises.
 This paper applies a method that measures marginal products of factors and
 changes in total factor productivity (TFP) by comparing actual changes in
 output to actual changes in inputs and in the institutional environment.
 This paper finds that there were marked improvements in the marginal
 productivity of factors and in TFP between 1980 and 1989. More important,
 the evidence shows that over 87 percent of the TFP growth was attributable
 to improved incentives, intensified product market competition, and
 improved factor allocation.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Geographic Concentration in U.S. Manufacturing Industries: A Dartboard Approach. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 889-927
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper discusses the prevalence of Silicon Valley-style localizations
 of individual manufacturing industries in the United States. A model in
 which localized industry-specific spillovers, natural advantages, and
 random chance contribute to geographic concentration motivates new indices
 of geographic concentration and coagglomeration. The indices contain
 controls that facilitate cross-industry and cross-country comparisons. The
 authors find almost all industries to be more concentrated than a random
 dart-throwing model predicts but the degree of localization is often
 slight. They also discuss which industries are concentrated, the
 geographic scope of localization, coagglomeration patterns, and other
 topics.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Liquidity, Banks, and Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 928-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the roles of markets and banks when both are active,
 characterizing the effects of financial market development on the
 structure and market share of banks. Banks lower the cost of giving
 investors rapid access to their capital and improve the liquidity of
 markets by diverting demand for liquidity from markets. Increased
 participation in markets causes the banking sector to shrink, primarily
 through reduced holdings of long-term assets. In addition, increased
 participation leads to longer-maturity real and financial assets and a
 smaller gap between the maturity of financial and real assets.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Options, Sunspots, and the Creation of Uncertainty. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 957-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors present two examples in which the addition of an option
 market leads to sunspot equilibria despite the fact that no sunspot
 equilibria exist without the market. These examples highlight limitations
 in two prevalent views of option markets. It is often assumed that option
 markets help complete otherwise incomplete markets. The authors
 demonstrate that they can instead increase the number of events agents
 wish to insure against. As in Fischer Black and Myron Scholes (1973), it
 is often assumed that option markets are redundant. The authors
 demonstrate that an option market may not be redundant even when markets
 were complete before its introduction.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Balanced-Budget Rules, Distortionary Taxes, and Aggregate Instability. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 976-1000
Issue: 5
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  A traditional argument against a balanced-budget fiscal policy rule is
 that it amplifies business cycles by stimulating aggregate demand during
 booms via tax cuts and higher public expenditures and by reducing demand
 during recessions through a corresponding fiscal contraction. This paper
 suggests an additional source of instability that may arise from this type
 of fiscal policy rule. It shows that, within the standard neoclassical
 growth model, a balanced-budget rule can make expectations of higher tax
 rates self-fulfilling if the fiscal authority relies heavily on changes in
 labor income taxes to eliminate short-run fiscal imbalances.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
