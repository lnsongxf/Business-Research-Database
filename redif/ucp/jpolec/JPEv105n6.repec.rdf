Title:   Parental Altruism and Inter Vivos Transfers: Theory and Evidence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1121-66
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper uses Panel Study of Income Dynamics data on the extended
 family to test whether inter vivos transfers from parents to children are
 motivated by altruism. Specifically, the paper tests whether an increase
 by one dollar in the income of parents actively making transfers to a
 child coupled with a one-dollar reduction in that child's income results
 in a one-dollar increase in the parents' transfer to the child. The
 authors find that redistributing one dollar from a recipient child to
 donor parents leads to less than a thirteen-cent increase in the
 transfer--far less than the one-dollar increase implied by altruism.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Risk Taking by Mutual Funds as a Response to Incentives. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1167-1200
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines a potential agency conflict between mutual fund
 investors and mutual fund companies. Investors would like the fund company
 to use its judgment to maximize risk-adjusted fund returns, the fund
 company has an incentive to increase the inflow of investments. The
 authors estimate the shape of the flow-performance relationship for a
 sample of growth and growth and income funds observed over the 1982-92
 period. The shape creates incentives for fund managers to alter the
 riskiness of their portfolios. Examining portfolio holdings, the authors
 find that risk levels are changed toward the end of the year in a manner
 consistent with these incentives.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Endogenous Substitution among Energy Resources and Global Warming. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1201-34
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A model of global warming with endogenous substitution of energy
 resources and multiple energy demands is developed. It suggests that, if
 historical rates of cost reduction in the production of solar energy are
 maintained, most of the world's coal will never be used. The world will
 move from oil and natural gas use to solar energy. Temperatures will rise
 by only about 1.5-2.0 degrees centigrade by the middle of the twenty-first
 century and then decline to preindustrial levels. These results are
 significantly lower than those predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on
 Climate Change and suggest that the case for global warming may be
 seriously overstated.	 Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Why Do Mexican Americans Earn Low Wages? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1235-68
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Using Current Population Survey data from November 1979 and 1989, the
 author finds that Mexican Americans earn low wages primarily because they
 possess less human capital than other workers, not because they receive
 smaller labor-market rewards for their skills. Among third- and
 higher-generation men in 1989, Mexicans averaged 21 percent lower wages
 than non-Hispanic whites, which is roughly similar to the wage deficit for
 blacks. For Mexicans, more than three-quarters of the wage gap is
 attributable to their relative youth, English language deficiencies, and
 especially their lower educational attainment. By contrast, these
 variables explain less than a third of the black-white wage gap.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Displacing the Family: Union Army Pensions and Elderly Living Arrangements. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1269-92
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The author investigates the factors that fostered the rise in separate
 living quarters for the aged prior to Social Security by estimating the
 income effect of the first major pension program in the United States,
 that covering Union Army veterans. She finds that income substantially
 increased demand for separate living arrangements, suggesting that prior
 to 1940 rising incomes were the most important factor enabling the elderly
 to live alone. Comparisons with recent studies imply that income no longer
 plays as large a role, perhaps because income levels are now higher and
 independent living is both less expensive and more attractive.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Short-Run and Long-Run Effects of Changes in Money in a Random-Matching Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1293-1307
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A random-matching model of money is used to deduce the effects of a
 once-for-all change in the quantity of money. It is shown that the change
 has short-run effects that are predominantly real and long-run effects
 that are in the direction of being predominantly nominal provided that the
 change is random and people learn its realization only with a lag. The
 change in the quantity of money comes about through a random process of
 discovery that does not permit anyone to deduce the aggregate amount
 discovered when the change actually occurs.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Money, Inflation, and Output under Fiat and Commodity Standards. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1308-21
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the behavior of money, inflation, and output under
 fiat and commodity standards to better understand how changes in monetary
 policy affect economic activity. Using long-term historical data for
 fifteen countries, the authors find that, under fiat standards, the growth
 rates of various monetary aggregates are more highly correlated with
 inflation and with each other than under commodity standards. Money
 growth, inflation, and output growth are also higher. In contrast, the
 authors do not find that money growth is more highly correlated with
 output growth under one standard than under the other.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.

Title:   Pareto and Political Economy as a Science: Methodological Revolution and Analytical Advances in Economic Theory in the 1890s. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1322-48
Issue: 6
Volume: 105
Year: 1997
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  It is argued that Joseph Schumpeter's widely accepted judgment that
 Pareto's work is 'completely rooted in Walras's system' constitutes a
 misreading of Pareto. In fact, already during the period 1892-1900, Pareto
 traces the methodological outlines of an economic science profoundly
 different from that of Walras. It is maintained that his methodological
 contribution represents an attempt to define the conditions for political
 economy to be a science. In this context, Pareto examines the theoretical
 premises of economic theories and questions the hypotheses of perfect
 foresight and rationality. The ordinalist hypothesis is also shown to be a
 consequence of these methodological reflections.   Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago.
