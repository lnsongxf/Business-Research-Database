Title: Is Child Labor Inefficient?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 663-679
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: We build a model of child labor and study its implications for welfare. We assume that there is a trade-off between child labor and the accumulation of human capital. Even if parents are altruistic and child labor is socially inefficient, it may arise in equilibrium because parents fail to fully internalize its negative effects. This occurs when bequests are zero or when capital markets are imperfect. We also study the effects of a simple ban on child labor and derive conditions under which it may be Pareto improving in general equilibrium. We show that the implications of child labor for fertility are ambiguous.

Title: Homework in Development Economics: Household Production and the Wealth of Nations
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 680-687
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: We introduce home production into the neoclassical growth model and examine its consequences for development economics. In particular, we study the extent to which one can account for international income differences with differences in policies that distort capital accumulation. In models with home production, such policies not only reduce capital accumulation but also change the mix of market and nonmarket activity. Hence these models can generate larger differences in output than standard models for a given policy differential. We also show how the welfare implications change when we incorporate home production.

Title: In Sickness and in Health: Risk Sharing within Households in Rural Ethiopia
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 688-727
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: Much of the literature on consumption smoothing and on risk sharing has focused on the ability of the household as a unit to protect its consumption. Little is known about the ability of individual members of the household to keep consumption smooth over time or relative to other members of the household. We use data on adult nutrition in Ethiopia to investigate whether individuals are able to smooth their consumption over time and within the household. We find that poorer households are not able to do so. Furthermore, poor southern households do not engage in complete risk sharing; women in these households bear the brunt of adverse shocks. This result implies that the collective model of household organization, which imposes Pareto efficiency on allocations, is rejected for these households. Finally, we obtain estimates of the relative Pareto weights in household allocation. We find that a wife's relative position is better if customary laws on settlements at divorce are favorable or if she comes from a relatively wealthy background and that poor southern women have lower Pareto weights in allocation.

Title: The Making of an Oligopoly: Firm Survival and Technological Change in the Evolution of the U.S. Tire Industry
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 728-760
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: The number of producers in the U.S. tire industry grew for 25 years and then declined sharply, and the industry evolved to be an oligopoly. The role of technological change in shaping the industry's market structure is explored. A model of industry evolution featuring technological change is used to derive predictions that are tested using a novel data set on firm entry, exit, size, location, distribution networks, and technological choices prior to the shakeout of producers. Consistent with the model, earlier-entering and larger firms survived longer, principally because of the influence of age and size on technological change.

Title: Age and the Quality of Work: The Case of Modern American Painters
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 761-777
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: Psychologists have found that the age at which successful practitioners typically do their best work varies across professions, but they have not considered whether these peak ages change over time, as economic models suggest they might. Using auction records, we estimate the relationship between artists' ages and the value of their paintings for two successive cohorts of leading modern American painters: de Kooning, Pollock, Rothko, and others born during 19001920 and Frank Stella, Warhol, and others born during 192140. We find that a substantial decline occurred over time in the age at which these artists produced their most valuableand most importantwork and argue that this was caused by a shift in the nature of the demand for modern art during the 1950s.

Title: Balladurette and Juppette: A Discrete Analysis of Scrapping Subsidies
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 778-806
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: This paper studies the effects of subsidies on durable goods markets. In particular, we focus on a recent policy in France in which the governments of Balladur and Jupp&eacute; subsidized the replacement of old cars with new ones. To study this policy, we construct a dynamic stochastic discrete choice model of car ownership at the household level. The resulting decision rules and equilibrium conditions are used to estimate the underlying parameters of the model using aggregate data. These policy functions are used to evaluate the short- and long-run effects of the French policies. We find that these policies do stimulate the automobile sector in the short run but, through the induced changes in the cross-sectional distribution of car ages, create the basis for subsequent low activity. Further, while these policies increase government revenues in the short run, revenues in the long run are lower relative to a baseline without intervention.

Title: Earnings within Education Groups and Overall Productivity Growth
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 807-832
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: To offer a possible interpretation for recent empirical findings on earnings growth, this paper constructs a simple model with endogenous human capital investment, a distribution of natural abilities, and unbiased technological progress. The model predicts that in the long run, average earnings within any education group will grow more slowly than average wages overall. It also predicts that average earnings in high-education groups ultimately will rise relative to average earnings in low-education groups. In the model, these processes do not imply secular increases in the degree of inequality in the overall cross-sectional distribution of earnings.

Title: Equilibrium Price Dispersion in Retail Markets for Prescription Drugs
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 833-862
Issue: 4
Volume: 108
Year: 2000
Month: August
Abstract: This study seeks to establish the empirical importance of price dispersion due to costly consumer search by examining retail prices for prescription drugs. Posted prices in two geographically distinct markets are shown to vary considerably across pharmacies within the same market, even after one controls for variation due to pharmacy differences. Pharmacy heterogeneity accounts for at most one-third of the observed price dispersion. The empirical analysis hinges on the observation that consumers' incentives to price-shop depend on characteristics of the drug therapy. Cross-sectional patterns in price distributions across drugs are consistent with the predictions of a search model: prices for repeatedly purchased prescriptions (for which the expected benefits of search are highest) exhibit significant reductions in both dispersion and price-cost margins.
