Title: On the Distribution of Income and Worker Assignment under Intrafirm Spillovers, with an Application to Ideas and Networks
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: I study the earnings structure and the equilibrium assignment of workers when workers exert intrafirm spillovers on each other. I allow for arbitrary spillovers provided that output depends on some aggregate index of workers' skill. Despite the possibility of increasing returns to skills, equilibrium typically exists. I show that equilibrium will typically be segregated and that the skill space can be partitioned into a set of segments and any firm hires from only one segment. Next, I apply the model to analyze the effect of information technology on segmentation and the distribution of income. There are two types of human capital, productivity and creativity, that is, the ability to produce ideas that may be duplicated over a network. Under plausible assumptions, inequality rises and then falls when network size increases, and the poorest workers cannot lose. I also analyze the impact of an improvement in worker quality and of an increased international mobility of ideas.

Title: How Much Did the Liberty Shipbuilders Learn? New Evidence for an Old Case Study
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 103-137
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: This paper offers some new estimates of the contribution of learning to the rapid increases in labor productivity observed in the construction of Liberty ships during World War II. The study exploits new data on physical capital investment and vessel quality constructed from contemporary records held at the National Archives. Estimates of the rate of learning are shown to be sensitive to the inclusion of the new capital data, and data on vessel quality provide evidence that part of the measured productivity increases were secured at the expense of quality.

Title: Inequality, Control Rights, and Rent Seeking: Sugar Cooperatives in Maharashtra
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 138-190
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: This paper presents a theory of rent seeking within farmer cooperatives in which inequality of asset ownership affects relative control rights of different groups of members. The two key assumptions are constraints on lump-sum transfers from poorer members and disproportionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficiency by inducing a lower input price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 197193.

Title: The Identification of Unobservable Independent and Spousal Leisure
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 191-202
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: This paper is based on the idea that for each partner in a marriage, there are two distinct types of leisure. One type is each person's independent (or private) leisure, and the other type is spousal leisure, whose importance has long been emphasized in the literature of psychology. While each type of leisure is unobservable (only total leisure is observed), it is shown that the recent collective models of the intrahousehold allocation initiated by Chiappori can be extended to identify each type of leisure up to an additive constant. In particular, the effects of each member's wage, household unearned income, and extrahousehold environmental parameters on the independent and spousal leisure and on the sharing rule are fully identified. The observational requirement here is the same as in other studies, namely, the observation of individual labor supply, individual wages, household unearned income, one assignable good, and consumption expenditure at the household level.

Title: Racial Bias in Motor Vehicle Searches: Theory and Evidence
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 203-232
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: Police checking for illegal drugs are much more likely to search the vehicles of African-American motorists than those of white motorists. This paper develops a model of police and motorist behavior that suggests an empirical test for distinguishing whether this disparity is due to racial prejudice or to the police's objective to maximize arrests. When applied to vehicle search data from Maryland, our test results are consistent with the hypothesis of no racial prejudice against African-American motorists. However, if police have utility only for searches yielding large drug finds, then our analysis would suggest bias against white drivers. The model's prediction regarding nonrace characteristics is also largely supported by the data.

Title: Public versus Private Initiative in Arctic Exploration: The Effects of Incentives and Organizational Structure
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 38-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: From 1818 to 1909, 35 government and 57 privately funded expeditions sought to locate and navigate a Northwest Passage, discover the North Pole, and make other significant discoveries in Arctic regions. Most major Arctic discoveries were made by private expeditions. Most tragedies were publicly funded. Public expeditions were better funded than their private counterparts yet lost more ships, experienced poorer crew health, and had more men die. Public expeditions' poor performance is not attributable to differences in objectives, available technologies, or country of origin. Rather, it reflects a tendency toward poor leadership structures, slow adaptation to new information, and perverse incentives.

Title: Endogenous Enfranchisement When Groups' Preferences Conflict
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 79-102
Issue: 1
Volume: 109
Year: 2001
Month: February
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Aumann, Kurz, and Neyman found the surprising result that the choice of levels of public goods in a democracy is not affected by the distribution of voting rights. This implies that groups of individuals may not value the franchise. This conclusion, however, does not correspond to what we commonly observe. We propose a new model to address the question of enfranchisement. The main feature of our model is that it takes into account natural affinities, such as religion or class, that may exist between voters. This allows us to show that while individuals may not value the vote, they nonetheless value the franchise. We also show that in the presence of nonconvexities, it is more likely that the group in power will grant the franchise when preferences are severely opposed.
