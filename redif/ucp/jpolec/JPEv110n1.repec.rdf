Title: Endogenous Policy Decentralization: Testing the Central Tenet of Economic Federalism
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-36
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: The economic theory of federalism is largely built around the premise that more heterogeneous preferences result in more decentralized policy making. Despite its prominence and importance, this central tenet of economic federalism has never been empirically evaluated. This paper presents the first formal test of the link between preference heterogeneity and endogenous policy decentralization using as a case study liquor control in the United States over the period 193470. The results are reassuring: States with more heterogeneous preferences are more likely to decentralize liquor control and allow for local government decision making.

Title: The Role of Leasing under Adverse Selection
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 113-143
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: Leasing contracts are extensively used in durable goods markets. These contracts specify a rental rate and an option price at which the used good can be bought on termination of the lease. This option price cannot be controlled when the car is sold. We show that in a world in which quality is observable, this additional control variable is ineffective. Under adverse selection instead, leasing contracts affect equilibrium allocations in a way that matches observed behavior in the car market. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that leased cars have a higher turnover and that off-lease used cars are of higher quality. Moreover, the model predicts that the recent increase in leasing can be explained by the observed increase in car durability. We show that leasing contracts can improve welfare but that they are imperfect tools. We also show that a producer with market power can benefit from leasing contracts for two reasons: market segmentation and better pricing of the option. Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection, we show that this is not in their interest.

Title: Putting Out the Fires: Will Higher Taxes Reduce the Onset of Youth Smoking?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 144-169
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: This paper reexamines whether higher cigarette taxes will substantially reduce youth smoking. We study the impact of taxes during exactly the period in adolescence in which most smokers start their habits. We find weak or nonexistent tax effects in models of the onset of smoking between eighth and twelfth grades, models of the onset of heavy smoking between eighth and twelfth grades, and discrete-time hazard models that include state fixed effects. We also provide a new perspective on the relationship between smoking and schooling: students who eventually drop out of school are already more likely to smoke in the eighth grade.

Title: Order Flow and Exchange Rate Dynamics
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 170-180
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: This paper presents an exchange rate model of a new kind. Instead of relying exclusively on macroeconomic determinants, the model includes a determinant from the field of microstructure financeorder flow. Order flow is a determinant because it conveys information. This is a radically different approach to exchange rates. It is also strikingly successful. Our model of daily deutsche mark/dollar log changes produces an R2 statistic above 60 percent. For the deutsche mark/dollar spot market as a whole, we find that $1 billion of net dollar purchases increases the deutsche mark price of a dollar by 0.5 percent.

Title: A Theory of Prostitution
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 181-214
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: Prostitution is low-skill, labor intensive, female, and well paid. This paper proposes a marriage market explanation to this puzzle. If a prostitute compromises her marriage market prospects, she will have to be compensated for forgone marriage market opportunities. We discuss the link between poverty and prostitution and show that prostitution may decrease with male income if wives and prostitutes are drawn from the same pool of women. We point to the role of male sex ratios, and males in transit, in sustaining high levels of prostitution, and we discuss possible reasons for its low reputation and implications for marriage patterns.

Title: The Effects of Seed Money and Refunds on Charitable Giving: Experimental Evidence from a University Capital Campaign
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 215-233
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: We design a field experiment to test two theories of fund-raising for threshold public goods: Andreoni predicts that publicly announced "seed money" will increase charitable donations, whereas Bagnoli and Lipman predict a similar increase for a refund policy. Experimentally manipulating a solicitation of 3,000 households for a university capital campaign produced data confirming both predictions. Increasing seed money from 10 percent to 67 percent of the campaign goal produced a nearly sixfold increase in contributions, with significant effects on both participation rates and average gift size. Imposing a refund increased contributions by a more modest 20 percent, with significant effects on average gift size.

Title: Marriage Market, Divorce Legislation, and Household Labor Supply
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 37-72
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of the marriage market and divorce legislation on household labor supply. In our approach, the sex ratio in the marriage market and the rules governing divorce are examples of "distribution factors." These factors are defined as variables that affect the household members' bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget set. We extend the collective labor supply model developed by Chiappori to allow for distribution factors. We show that our model imposes new restrictions on the labor supply functions and eases the identification of individual preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988. Our results do not reject the restrictions imposed by the model. Also, the sex ratio and divorce laws deemed favorable to women are found to affect labor supply behavior and the decision process in the directions predicted by the theory and to have sizable effects.

Title: Money, Interest Rates, and Exchange Rates with Endogenously Segmented Markets
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 73-112
Issue: 1
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: February
Abstract: We analyze the effects of money injections on interest rates and exchange rates when agents must pay a Baumol-Tobin-style fixed cost to exchange bonds and money. Asset markets are endogenously segmented because this fixed cost leads agents to trade bonds and money infrequently. When the government injects money through an open market operation, only those agents that are currently trading absorb these injections. Through their impact on these agents' consumption, these money injections affect real interest rates and real exchange rates. The model generates the observed negative relation between expected inflation and real interest rates as well as persistent liquidity effects in interest rates and volatile and persistent exchange rates.
