Title: The Rise of Mass Consumption Societies
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1035-1070
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: This paper studies mechanisms behind the rise of mass consumption societies. The development process depicted follows the Flying Geese pattern, in which a series of industries take off one after another. As productivity improves in these industries, each consumer good becomes affordable to an increasingly large number of households, which constantly expand the range of goods they consume. This in turn generates larger markets for consumer goods, which leads to further improvement in productivity. For such virtuous cycles of productivity gains and expanding markets to occur, income distribution should be neither too equal nor too unequal. With too much equality, the economy stagnates in a poverty trap. With too much inequality, the development stops prematurely.

Title: The Tenuous Trade-off between Risk and Incentives
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1071-1102
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: Empirical work testing for a negative trade-off between risk and incentives has not had much success: the data suggest a positive relationship between measures of uncertainty and incentives rather than the posited negative trade-off. I argue that the existing literature fails to account for an important effect of uncertainty on incentives through the allocation of responsibility to employees. When workers operate in certain settings, firms are content to assign tasks to workers and monitor their inputs. By contrast, when the situation is more uncertain, they delegate responsibility to workers but, to constrain their discretion, base compensation on observed output.

Title: Political Intervention in Debt Contracts
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1103-1134
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model of an agricultural economy in which poor farmers borrow from rich farmers. Because output is stochastic (we allow for idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks), there may be default ex post. We compare equilibria with and without political intervention. Intervention takes the form of a moratorium and is decided by voting. When bad economic shocks are highly likely, state-contingent debt moratoria always improve ex post efficiency and may also improve ex ante efficiency. Moreover, the threat of moratoria enhances efficiency. When adverse macro shocks are unlikely, state-contingent moratoria always improve ex ante welfare by completing incomplete debt contracts.

Title: A Model of the Federal Funds Rate Target
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1135-1167
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: This paper is a statistical analysis of the manner in which the Federal Reserve determines the level of the federal funds rate target, one of the most publicized and anticipated economic indicators in the financial world. The paper introduces new statistical tools for forecasting a discrete-valued time series such as the target and suggests that these methods, in conjunction with a focus on the institutional details of how the target is determined, can significantly improve on standard vector autoregression forecasts of the effective federal funds rate. We further show that the news that the Fed has changed the target has statistical content substantially different from the news that the Fed failed to make an anticipated target change, causing us to challenge some of the conclusions drawn from standard linear VAR impulse-response functions.

Title: Skill and the Value of Life
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1168-1197
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: The value of statistical life (VSL) can be inferred through real-world wagefatality risk trade-offs made across different occupations. This paper shows that the VSL based on the wage-risk trade-off tends to be biased upward if it does not account for the diversity of workers' unobservable skill to cope privately with job risk. This upward bias arises because the highest required wage differential among the workers is divided by their average risk across the population.

Title: The Slowdown of the Economics Publishing Process
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 947-993
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: Over the last three decades there has been a dramatic slowdown of the publication process at top economics journals. A substantial part is due to journals' requiring more extensive revisions. Various explanations are considered: democratization of the review process, increases in the complexity of papers, growth of the profession, and cost and benefit arguments. Changes in the profession are examined using time-series data. Connections between these changes and the slowdown are examined using paper-level data. There is evidence for some explanations, but most of the slowdown remains unexplained. Changes may reflect evolving social norms.

Title: Evolving Standards for Academic Publishing: A q-r Theory
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 994-1034
Issue: 5
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: October
Abstract: This paper develops models of quality standards to examine two trends: academic journals increasingly require extensive revisions of submissions, and articles are becoming longer and changing in other ways. Papers are modeled as varying along two quality dimensions: q reflects the importance of the main ideas and r other aspects of quality. Observed trends are regarded as increases in r-quality. A static equilibrium model illustrates comparative statics explanations. A dynamic model in which referees (with a biased view of their own work) learn social norms for weighting q and r is shown to produce a long, gradual evolution of social norms.
