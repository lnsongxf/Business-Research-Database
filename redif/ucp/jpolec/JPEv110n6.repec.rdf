Title: The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Industrial Activity: Evidence from the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Census of Manufactures

Abstract: This paper estimates the impacts of the Clean Air Act's division of counties into pollutant-specific nonattainment and attainment categories on measures of industrial activity obtained from 1.75 million plant observations from the Census of Manufactures. Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant-level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (197287), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution-intensive industries. These findings are robust across many specifications, and the effects are apparent in many polluting industries.

Title: Optimal Taxation without State-Contingent Debt
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1220-1254
Issue: 6
Volume: 110

Abstract: In an economy studied by Lucas and Stokey, tax rates inherit the serial correlation structure of government expenditures, belying Barro's earlier result that taxes should be a random walk for any stochastic process of government expenditures. To recover a version of Barro's random walk tax-smoothing outcome, we modify Lucas and Stokey's economy to permit only risk-free debt. Having only risk-free debt confronts the Ramsey planner with additional constraints on equilibrium allocations beyond one imposed by Lucas and Stokey's assumption of complete markets. The Ramsey outcome blends features of Barro's model with Lucas and Stokey's. In our model, the contemporaneous effects of exogenous government expenditures on the government deficit and taxes resemble those in Lucas and Stokey's model, but incomplete markets put a nearunit root component into government debt and taxes, an outcome like Barro's. However, we show that without ad hoc limits on the government's asset holdings, outcomes can diverge in important ways from Barro's. Our results use and extend recent advances in the consumption-smoothing literature.

Title: Catching Up with the Joneses: Heterogeneous Preferences and the Dynamics of Asset Prices
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1255-1285
Issue: 6
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: December
Abstract: We analyze a general equilibrium exchange economy with a continuum of agents who have "catching up with the Joneses" preferences and differ only with respect to the curvature of their utility functions. While individual risk aversion does not change over time, dynamic redistribution of wealth among the agents leads to countercyclical time variation in the Sharpe ratio of stock returns. We show that both the conditional risk premium and the return volatility are negatively related to the level of stock prices. Therefore, our model exhibits many of the empirically observed properties of aggregate stock returns, for example, patterns of autocorrelation in returns, the "leverage effect" in return volatility, and long-horizon return predictability.

Title: Evaluating the Effect of Teachers' Group Performance Incentives on Pupil Achievement
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1286-1317
Issue: 6
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: December
Abstract: Proposals to use teachers' performance incentives have recently attracted considerable attention. However, there is very little experience with applying incentives in schools. This paper provides evidence on the causal effects of two programs: the first provided the school and its teachers with monetary performance incentives and the second with additional conventional resources. The assignment of schools to the two programs was not random; therefore, identification is a central issue in the empirical analysis. The empirical results suggest that schools' and teachers' group monetary incentives caused significant gains in many dimensions of students' outcomes. Endowing schools with more resources also led to improvement in student performance. However, the comparison based on cost equivalency suggests that the teachers' incentive intervention is much more cost effective.

Title: Districting and Government Overspending
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1318-1354
Issue: 6
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: December
Abstract: Theories of government spending driven by a common-pool problem in the fiscal revenues pool predict that greater districting of a political jurisdiction raises the scale of government. This paper presents evidence on this and related predictions from a cross section of city governments in the United States. The main finding is that, when other plausible determinants of government spending are controlled for, greater districting leads to a considerably greater scale of government activity. The results also show that at-large electoral systems do not, and forms of government that concentrate powers in the office of the executive do, break this relationship.

Title: Employed 40 Hours or Not Employed 39: Lessons from the 1982 Mandatory Reduction of the Workweek
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1355-1389
Issue: 6
Volume: 110

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the February 1, 1982, mandatory reduction of weekly working hours in France. Just after Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand's election in 1981, the minimum wage was increased by 5 percent. The workweek was then reduced from 40 to 39 hours. At the same time, stable monthly earnings for minimum-wage earners were mandated. We show that workers employed 40 hours and above in March 1981 were more likely to lose their jobs between 1981 and 1982 than workers employed 3639 hours in March 1981. Moreover, many workers were still working 40 hours after February. These workers were also strongly affected by this reduction. Our estimates of the impact of this one-hour reduction on employment losses vary between 2 percent and 4 percent. Minimum-wage workers were most affected by the changes.

Title: Turnover of Used Durables in a Stationary Equilibrium: Are Older Goods Traded More?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1390-1413
Issue: 6
Volume: 110
Year: 2002
Month: December
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic model with transaction costs to determine the equilibrium resale pattern in a market for a durable good. The key result is that the probability of resale is nonmonotonic in the age of the good. Trade volume is relatively low in the very beginning and in the middle of a good's life. This result helps explain observed variations of resale rates across vintages for the U.S. market of used cars.
