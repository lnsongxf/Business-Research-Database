Title: Team Incentives and Worker Heterogeneity: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Teams on Productivity and Participation
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 465-497
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: This paper identifies and evaluates rationales for team participation and for the effects of team composition on productivity using novel data from a garment plant that shifted from individual piece rate to group piece rate production over three years. The adoption of teams at the plant improved worker productivity by 14 percent on average. Productivity improvement was greatest for the earliest teams and diminished as more workers engaged in team production, providing support for the view that teams utilize collaborative skills, which are less valuable in individual production. High-productivity workers tended to join teams first, despite a loss in earnings in many cases, suggesting nonpecuniary benefits associated with teamwork. Finally, more heterogeneous teams were more productive, with average ability held constant, which is consistent with explanations emphasizing mutual team learning and intrateam bargaining.

Title: Social Learning and Coordination Conventions in Intergenerational Games: An Experimental Study
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 498-529
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003

Abstract: We investigate the creation and evolution of conventions of behavior in "intergenerational games" or games in which a sequence of nonoverlapping "generations" of players play a stage game for a finite number of periods and are then replaced by other agents who continue the game in their role for an identical length of time. Players in generation t can offer advice to their successors in generation t + 1. What we find is that word-of-mouth social learning (in the form of advice from laboratory "parents" to laboratory "children") can be a strong force in the creation of social conventions.

Title: Welfare Dynamics under Time Limits
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 530-554
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: Among the most important changes brought about by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 are time limits, which provide consumers with an incentive to conserve their welfare benefits for future use. Among forward-looking, expected-utility-maximizing consumers who face liquidity constraints and earnings uncertainty, economic theory predicts that the incentive to conserve should be strongest among families with the youngest children. We test this prediction using data from Florida's Family Transition Program, a randomized welfare reform experiment. Our estimates generally exhibit the predicted age dependence, which suggests that time limits affect welfare use before they become binding. Our estimates indicate that, in the absence of other reforms that increased welfare use, FTP's time limit would have reduced welfare receipt by 16 percent.

Title: Is More Information Better? The Effects of "Report Cards" on Health Care Providers
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 555-588
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: Health care report cards' public disclosure of patient health outcomes at the level of the individual physician or hospital or bothmay address important informational asymmetries in markets for health care, but they may also give doctors and hospitals incentives to decline to treat more difficult, severely ill patients. Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity, quality, and appropriateness of medical treatment that they induce. Using national data on Medicare patients at risk for cardiac surgery, we find that cardiac surgery report cards in New York and Pennsylvania led both to selection behavior by providers and to improved matching of patients with hospitals. On net, this led to higher levels of resource use and to worse health outcomes, particularly for sicker patients. We conclude that, at least in the short run, these report cards decreased patient and social welfare.

Title: Relative Factor Abundance and Trade
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 589-610
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: I develop a factor content of trade prediction for the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model (HOV) that relates bilateral differences in country endowments to bilateral differences in factor contents. The results are striking. In comparisons of North-South factor contents or factor contents of countries with very different endowments (e.g., with very different capital-labor ratios), there is clear support for an HOV sign prediction. Thus countries with dissimilar endowment ratios also have very different factor content of trade differences as predicted by the HOV model.

Title: Schooling, Family Background, and Adoption: Is It Nature or Is It Nurture?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 611-641
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: When parents are more educated, their children tend to receive more schooling as well. Does this occur because parental ability is passed on genetically or because more educated parents provide a better environment for children to flourish? Using an intergenerational sample of families, we estimate on the basis of a comparison of biological and adopted children that about 5560 percent of the parental ability is genetically transmitted.

Title: Liquidity Risk and Expected Stock Returns
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 642-685
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: This study investigates whether marketwide liquidity is a state variable important for asset pricing. We find that expected stock returns are related cross-sectionally to the sensitivities of returns to fluctuations in aggregate liquidity. Our monthly liquidity measure, an average of individual-stock measures estimated with daily data, relies on the principle that order flow induces greater return reversals when liquidity is lower. From 1966 through 1999, the average return on stocks with high sensitivities to liquidity exceeds that for stocks with low sensitivities by 7.5 percent annually, adjusted for exposures to the market return as well as size, value, and momentum factors. Furthermore, a liquidity risk factor accounts for half of the profits to a momentum strategy over the same 34-year period.

Title: A Theory of Involuntary Unrequited International Transfers
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 686-715
Issue: 3
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: June
Abstract: The theory of involuntary international transfers (war indemnities) has been constructed on the assumption that the donor and recipient are completely indifferent to each other's well-being. The assumption is hard to justify since usually the transfers closely follow periods during which the countries have been dropping bombs on each other. In the present paper, we rework the theory on the more plausible assumption that the well-being of each country is negatively influenced by the well-being of the other country. It is shown that, contrary to the conventional theory, the donor might benefit at the expense of the recipient, even when local Walrasian stability is imposed.
