Title: Equilibrium Cross Section of Returns
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 693-732
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003

Abstract: We construct a dynamic general equilibrium production economy to explicitly link expected stock returns to firm characteristics such as firm size and the book-to-market ratio. Stock returns in the model are completely characterized by a conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Size and book-to-market are correlated with the true conditional market beta and therefore appear to predict stock returns. The cross-sectional relations between firm characteristics and returns can subsist even after one controls for typical empirical estimates of beta. These findings suggest that the empirical success of size and book-to-market can be consistent with a single-factor conditional CAPM model.

Title: Bequests as Signals: An Explanation for the Equal Division Puzzle
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 733-764
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: In the United States, more than two-thirds of decedents with multichild families divide their estates exactly equally among their children. In contrast, gifts given before death are usually unequal. These findings challenge the validity of existing theories regarding the determination of intergenerational transfers. In this paper, we develop a theory that accounts for this puzzle based on the notion that the division of bequests provides a signal about a parent's altruistic preferences. The theory can also explain the norm of unigeniture, which prevails in other societies.

Title: Who Affects Whom in Daily Newspaper Markets?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 765-784
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: When consumers share similar preferences, additional consumers will bring forth products that confer positive "preference externalities" on others. However, if distinct groups of consumers have substantially different preferences, the groups bring forth products with more appeal to themselves and less appeal to others. We document that in their capacity as daily newspaper consumers, blacks and whites are more likely to buy daily newspapers in markets with larger black and white populations, respectively. Similar results hold for Hispanics and non-Hispanics, but not by education, income, or age. We provide evidence that product positioning underlies our results.

Title: Bertrand and Walras Equilibria under Moral Hazard
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 785-817
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: We consider a simple model of competition under moral hazard with constant return technologies. We consider preferences that are not separable in effort: marginal utility of income is assumed to increase with leisure, especially for high income levels. We show that, in this context, Bertrand competition may result in positive equilibrium profit. This result holds for purely idiosyncratic shocks when only deterministic contracts are considered and extends to unrestricted contract spaces in the presence of aggregate uncertainty. Finally, these findings have important consequences on the definition of an equilibrium. We show that, in this context, a Walrasian general equilibrium &agrave; la Prescott-Townsend may fail to exist: any "equilibrium" must involve rationing.

Title: Accounting for the U.S. Earnings and Wealth Inequality
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 818-857
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: We show that a theory of earnings and wealth inequality, based on the optimal choices of ex ante identical households that face uninsured idiosyncratic shocks to their endowments of efficiency labor units, accounts for the U.S. earnings and wealth inequality almost exactly.

Title: Equity and Resources: An Analysis of Education Finance Systems
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 858-897
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: We analyze five education finance systems: local, state, foundation, power equalizing with recapture (PER), and power equalizing without recapture (PEN). In a calibrated model, we find that finance systems have large effects on educational resources and equity. The trade-off between equity and resources, however, is not monotone. Ranking systems by expected utility, we find that PER consistently ranks highest, though it provides fewer resources to education than the foundation and PEN systems and is less equitable than a state system. We prove that for an important subset of preferences, PER will win in majority voting comparisons with the other systems.

Title: The Substantial Bias from Ignoring General Equilibrium Effects in Estimating Excess Burden, and a Practical Solution
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 898-927
Issue: 4
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: August
Abstract: We show that under typical conditions the simple "excess-burden triangle" formula substantially underestimates the excess burden of commodity taxes, in some cases by a factor of 10 or more. This formula performs poorly because it ignores general equilibrium interactionsmost important, interactions between the taxed commodity and the labor market. Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias. We derive an implementable alternative to the simple formula. This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.
