Title: The Correlation of Wealth across Generations
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1155-1182
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: In this paper, we find that the age-adjusted elasticity of child wealth with respect to parental wealth is 0.37 before the transfer of bequests. Lifetime income and asset ownership jointly explain nearly two-thirds of the wealth elasticity. Education, past parental transfers, and expected future bequests account for little of the remaining elasticity. Survey measures of risk correlate strongly between parents and children. However, they explain little of the intergenerational similarity in the propensity to own different assets, suggesting that children's savings propensities are determined by mimicking their parents' behavior, or the inheritance of preferences not related to risk tolerance. Our results imply that while parents do pass on human capital and saving propensities to their children, the level of intergenerational fluidity is much greater than that suggested by recent accounts in the popular press.

Title: Overconfidence and Speculative Bubbles
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1183-1219
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: Motivated by the behavior of asset prices, trading volume, and price volatility during episodes of asset price bubbles, we present a continuous-time equilibrium model in which overconfidence generates disagreements among agents regarding asset fundamentals. With short-sale constraints, an asset buyer acquires an option to sell the asset to other agents when those agents have more optimistic beliefs. As in a paper by Harrison and Kreps, agents pay prices that exceed their own valuation of future dividends because they believe that in the future they will find a buyer willing to pay even more. This causes a significant bubble component in asset prices even when small differences of beliefs are sufficient to generate a trade. In equilibrium, bubbles are accompanied by large trading volume and high price volatility. Our analysis shows that while Tobin's tax can substantially reduce speculative trading when transaction costs are small, it has only a limited impact on the size of the bubble or on price volatility.

Title: Gold into Base Metals: Productivity Growth in the People's Republic of China during the Reform Period
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1220-1261
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: With minimal sleight of hand, it is possible to transform the recent growth experience of the People's Republic of China from the extraordinary into the mundane. Systematic understatement of inflation by enterprises accounts for 2.5 percent growth per year in the nonagricultural economy during the first two decades of the reform period (197898). The usual suspects (i.e., rising participation rates, improvements in educational attainment, and the transfer of labor out of agriculture) account for most of the remainder. The productivity performance of the nonagricultural economy during the reform period is respectable but not outstanding. To the degree that the reforms have improved efficiency, these gains may lie principally in agriculture.

Title: Hot Money
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1262-1292
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: Recent empirical work on financial crises documents that crises tend to occur when macroeconomic fundamentals are weak; but even after conditioning on an exhaustive list of fundamentals, a sizable random component to crises and associated capital flows remains. We develop a model of herd behavior consistent with these observations. Informational frictions together with standard debt default problems lead to volatile capital flows resembling hot money and financial crises. We show that repaying debt during difficult times identifies a government as financially resilient, enhances its reputation, and stabilizes capital flows. Bailing out governments deprives resilient countries of the opportunity to differentiate themselves from the nonresilient.

Title: Trade Expansion and Contract Enforcement
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1293-1317
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: Consider a world of traders separated in geographic, economic, or social space. Honest trade offers larger gains for more distant traders, but frequencies of meetings, and information flows about cheating, have local bias. Honesty is self-enforcing only between pairs of sufficiently close neighbors. Global honesty prevails only in a sufficiently small world. The extent of self-enforcing honesty is likely to decrease when the world expands beyond this size. Costly external enforcement is useful only if the world is sufficiently large, and its net payoff need not be larger than that of a self-governing small community. Intermediate-size worlds fare worst.

Title: The Trick Is to Live: Is the Estate Tax Social Security for the Rich?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1318-1341
Issue: 6
Volume: 111
Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: Because estate tax liability usually depends on how long one lives, it implicitly provides annuity income. In the absence of annuity markets, lump-sum estate taxation may be used to achieve the first-best solution for individuals with a sufficiently strong bequest motive. Calculations of the annuity embedded in the U.S. estate tax show that people with $10 million of assets may be effectively receiving more than $100,000 a year financed at actuarially fair rates by their tax payments. According to my calibrations, the insurance effect reduces the marginal cost of funds (MCF) for the estate tax by as much as 30 percent, and the resulting MCF is within the range of estimates for the MCF for the income tax.

Title: Unraveling Reduces Mobility in a Labor Market: Gastroenterology with and without a Centralized Match
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1342-1352
Issue: 6

Year: 2003
Month: December
Abstract: The entry-level market for American gastroenterologists was organized by a centralized clearinghouse from 1986 to 1996. Before, and since, it has been conducted via a decentralized market in which appointment dates have unraveled to well over a year before the start of employment. We find that, both before and after the years in which the centralized clearinghouse was used, gastroenterologists are less mobile and more likely to be employed at the same hospital in which they were internal medicine residents than when the clearinghouse was in use. This suggests that the clearinghouse not only coordinates the timing of appointments but also increases the scope of the market, compared to a decentralized market with early appointments.

Title: A Note on Convergence of Adaptive Satisficing to Optimal Stopping

Abstract: The model concerns a searcher making multiple searches from the same distribution of payoffs. The searcher does not know the distribution, does not attempt to infer it from cumulating information, and does not attempt to compute an optimal stopping rule. Instead the searcher follows thoroughly elementary adaptive rules. Nonetheless, the searcher converges to optimal stopping.
