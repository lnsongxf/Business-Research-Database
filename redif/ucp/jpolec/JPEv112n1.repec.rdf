Title: Understanding Predictability
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-47
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004

Abstract: We propose a general equilibrium model with multiple securities in which investors' risk preferences and expectations of dividend growth are time-varying. While time-varying risk preferences induce the standard positive relation between the dividend yield and expected returns, time-varying expected dividend growth induces a negative relation between them. These offsetting effects reduce the ability of the dividend yield to forecast returns and eliminate its ability to forecast dividend growth, as observed in the data. The model links the predictability of returns to that of dividend growth, suggesting specific changes to standard linear predictive regressions for both. The model's predictions are confirmed empirically.

Title: Capital Structure and Stock Returns
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 106-131
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004

Abstract: U.S. corporations do not issue and repurchase debt and equity to counteract the mechanistic effects of stock returns on their debt-equity ratios. Thus over one- to five-year horizons, stock returns can explain about 40 percent of debt ratio dynamics. Although corporate net issuing activity is lively and although it can explain 60 percent of debt ratio dynamics (long-term debt issuing activity being most capital structurerelevant), corporate issuing motives remain largely a mystery. When stock returns are accounted for, many other proxies used in the literature play a much lesser role in explaining capital structure.

Title: Estimation of Educational Borrowing Constraints Using Returns to Schooling
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 132-182
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004
Month: February
Abstract: This paper measures the importance of borrowing constraints on education decisions. Empirical identification of borrowing constraints is secured by the economic prediction that opportunity costs and direct costs of schooling affect borrowing-constrained and unconstrained persons differently. Direct costs need to be financed during school and impose a larger burden on credit-constrained students. By contrast, gross forgone earnings do not have to be financed. We explore the implications of this idea using four methodologies: schooling attainment models, instrumental variable wage regressions, and two structural economic models that integrate both schooling choices and schooling returns into a unified framework. None of the methods produces evidence that borrowing constraints generate inefficiencies in the market for schooling in the current policy environment. We conclude that, on the margin, additional policies aimed at improving credit access will have little impact on schooling attainment.

Title: Adverse Selection in Insurance Markets: Policyholder Evidence from the U.K. Annuity Market
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 183-208
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004
Month: February
Abstract: We use a unique data set of annuities in the United Kingdom to test for adverse selection. We find systematic relationships between ex post mortality and annuity characteristics, such as the timing of payments and the possibility of payments to the annuitant's estate. These patterns are consistent with the presence of asymmetric information. However, we find no evidence of substantive mortality differences by annuity size. These results suggest that the absence of selection on one contract dimension does not preclude its presence on others. This highlights the importance of considering detailed features of insurance contracts when testing theoretical models of asymmetric information.

Title: The Distribution of Talent and the Pattern and Consequences of International Trade
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 209-239
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004
Month: February
Abstract: I study the interaction between imperfect labor contracts and international trade in a setting in which workers have private information about their own abilities. When an individual's contribution to firm output can be measured accurately in some activities but not in others, the most able workers select occupations in which their pay most closely reflects their own performance. In a world economy with two otherwise similar countries that have different distributions of talent, the country with the more heterogeneous labor force exports the good that is produced by the most talented individuals. In this country, trade exacerbates the "polarization" of the labor force and often worsens the distribution of income.

Title: A Direct Test of the Theory of Comparative Advantage: The Case of Japan
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 48-67
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004
Month: February
Abstract: We exploit Japan's sudden and complete opening up to international trade in the 1860s to test the empirical validity of one of the oldest and most fundamental propositions in economics: the theory of comparative advantage. Historical evidence supports the assertion that the characteristics of the Japanese economy at the time were compatible with the key assumptions of the neoclassical trade model. Using detailed product-specific data on autarky prices and trade flows, we find that the autarky price value of Japan's trade is negative for each year of the period 186875. This confirms the prediction of the theory.

Title: Differentiated Products Demand Systems from a Combination of Micro and Macro Data: The New Car Market
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 68-105
Issue: 1
Volume: 112
Year: 2004

Abstract: In this paper, we consider how rich sources of information on consumer choice can help to identify demand parameters in a widely used class of differentiated products demand models. Most important, we show how to use "second-choice" data on automotive purchases to obtain good estimates of substitution patterns in the automobile industry. We use our estimates to make out-of-sample predictions about important recent changes in industry structure.
