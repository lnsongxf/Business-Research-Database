Title: Identifying Placebo Effects with Data from Clinical Trials
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 236-256
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006

Abstract: A medical treatment is said to have placebo effects if patients who are optimistic about the treatment respond better to the treatment. This paper proposes a simple test for placebo effects. Instead of comparing the treatment and control arms of a single trial, one should compare the treatment arms of two trials with different probabilities of assignment to treatment. If there are placebo effects, patients in the higher-probability trial will experience better outcomes simply because they believe that there is a greater chance of receiving treatment. This paper finds evidence of placebo effects in trials of antiulcer and cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Title: Designing Optimal Disability Insurance: A Case for Asset Testing
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 257-279
Issue: 2
Volume: 114

Abstract: We analyze an implementation of an optimal disability insurance system as a competitive equilibrium with taxes. An optimum is implemented by an asset-tested disability system in which a disability transfer is paid only if an agent has assets below a specified maximum. The logic behind this result is that an agent who plans to falsely claim disability (a) finds doing so unattractive if he does not adjust his savings and (b) cannot collect disability insurance if he does adjust his savings in the desired direction (upward). For a calibrated economy, we find that welfare gains from asset testing are significant.

Title: 	Media Bias and Reputation
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 280-316
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: April
Abstract: A Bayesian consumer who is uncertain about the quality of an information source will infer that the source is of higher quality when its reports conform to the consumer's prior expectations. We use this fact to build a model of media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even though it can make all market participants worse off. The model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers receive independent evidence on the true state of the world and that competition between independently owned news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.

Title: On the Weights of Nations: Assigning Voting Weights in a Heterogeneous Union
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 317-339
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: April
Abstract: We study indirect democracy in which countries, states, or districts each elect a representative who later votes at a union level on their behalf. We show that the voting rule that maximizes the total expected utility of all agents in the union involves assigning a weight to each district's vote and then sticking with the status quo unless at least a threshold of weighted votes is cast for change. We analyze how the weights relate to the population size of a country and the correlation structure of agents' preferences, and then we compare the voting weights in the Council of the European Union under the Nice Treaty and the recently proposed Constitution.

Title: Do Firms Maximize? Evidence from Professional Football
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 340-365
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: April
Abstract: This paper examines a single, narrow decision&mdash;the choice on fourth down in the National Football League between kicking and trying for a first down&mdash;as a case study of the standard view that competition in the goods, capital, and labor markets leads firms to make maximizing choices. Play-by-play data and dynamic programming are used to estimate the average payoffs to kicking and trying for a first down under different circumstances. Examination of actual decisions shows systematic, clear-cut, and overwhelmingly statistically significant departures from the decisions that would maximize teams' chances of winning. Possible reasons for the departures are considered.

Title: Coordination and Experimentation in M-Form and U-Form Organizations
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 366-402
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: April
Abstract: We compare the performance of organizational forms (M-form and U-form) in experimenting with uncertain projects. In our framework, organizational forms affect the information structure of an organization and thus the way to coordinate changes. Compared to the U-form, the M-form organization achieves better coordination in "attribute matching" but suffers from coordination in "attribute compatibility" and less gains in specialization. The distinctive advantage of the M-form is its flexibility in choosing between small-scale and full-scale experimentation.

Title: Economics: An Emerging Small World
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 403-432
Issue: 2
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: April
Abstract: We study the evolution of social distance among economists over the period 1970&ndash;2000. While the number of economists has more than doubled, the distance between them, which was already small, has declined significantly. The key to understanding the short average distances is the observation that economics is spanned by a collection of interlinked stars. A star is an economist who writes with many other economists, most of whom have few coauthors and generally do not write with each other.
