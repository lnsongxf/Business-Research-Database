Title: The Dynamic Effects of Neutral and Investment-Specific Technology Shocks
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 413-451
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: The neoclassical growth model is used to identify the short-run effects of neutral technology shocks, which affect the production of all goods homogeneously, and investment-specific shocks, which affect only investment goods. The real equipment price, crucial for identifying the investment shocks, experiences an abrupt increase in its average rate of decline in 1982, so the analysis is based on a split sample. On the basis of the preferred specification, the two technology shocks account for 73 percent of hours' and 44 percent of output's business cycle variation before 1982, and 38 percent and 80 percent afterward. The shocks also account for more than 40 percent of hours' and 58 percent of output's forecast errors over a three- to eight-year horizon in both samples. The majority of these effects are driven by the investment shocks.

Title: Signaling in a Global Game: Coordination and Policy Traps
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 452-484
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: This paper introduces signaling in a global game so as to examine the informational role of policy in coordination environments such as currency crises and bank runs. While exogenous asymmetric information has been shown to select a unique equilibrium, we show that the endogenous information generated by policy interventions leads to multiple equilibria. The policy maker is thus trapped into a position in which self-fulfilling expectations dictate not only the coordination outcome but also the optimal policy. This result does not rely on the freedom to choose out-of-equilibrium beliefs, nor on the policy being a public signal; it may obtain even if the policy is observed with idiosyncratic noise.

Title: Efficient Competitive Equilibria with Adverse Selection
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 485-516
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: Do Walrasian markets function orderly in the presence of adverse selection? In particular, is their outcome efficient when exclusive contracts are enforceable? This paper addresses these questions in the context of a Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance economy. We identify an externality associated with the presence of adverse selection as a special form of consumption externality. Consequently, we show that competitive equilibria always exist but are not typically incentive efficient. However, as markets for pollution rights can internalize environmental externalities, markets for consumption rights can be designed to internalize the consumption externality due to adverse selection. With such markets competitive equilibria exist and incentive-constrained versions of the first and second welfare theorems hold.

Title: How Basic Are Behavioral Biases? Evidence from Capuchin Monkey Trading Behavior
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 517-537
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: Behavioral economics has demonstrated systematic decision-making biases in both lab and field data. Do these biases extend across contexts, cultures, or even species? We investigate this question by introducing fiat currency and trade to a colony of capuchin monkeys and recovering their preferences over a range of goods and gambles. We show that capuchins react rationally to both price and wealth shocks but display several hallmark biases when faced with gambles, including reference dependence and loss aversion. Given our capuchins' inexperience with money and trade, these results suggest that loss aversion extends beyond humans and may be innate rather than learned.

Title: 	Selling Labor Low: Wage Responses to Productivity Shocks in Developing Countries
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 538-575
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: Productivity risk is pervasive in underdeveloped countries. This paper highlights a way in which underdevelopment exacerbates productivity risk. Productivity shocks cause larger changes in the wage when workers are poorer, less able to migrate, and more credit-constrained because of such workers' inelastic labor supply. This equilibrium wage effect hurts workers. In contrast, it acts as insurance for landowners. Agricultural wage data for 257 districts in India for 1956&ndash;87 are used to test the predictions, with rainfall as an instrument for agricultural productivity. In districts with fewer banks or higher migration costs, the wage is much more responsive to fluctuations in productivity.

Title: Private International Debt with Risk of Repudiation
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 576-593
Issue: 3
Volume: 114

Month: June
Abstract: The risk of repudiation plays a central role in determining the size of international capital flows. In this paper I compare a centralized arrangement for international debt, where only governments borrow and lend internationally, with a decentralized arrangement, where individual borrowers have access to international capital markets. I show that a centralized setup allows more international risk sharing and higher welfare than a decentralized setup. That is, there is a positive role for government regulation of international borrowing.

Title: Simon Rottenberg and Baseball, Then and Now: A Fiftieth Anniversary Retrospective
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 594-623
Issue: 3
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: June
Abstract: Fifty years ago this Journal published Simon Rottenberg's "The Baseball Players' Labor Market," the first professional journal article in sports economics. In this retrospective we review some of his insights and analyses with regard to competitive balance, constraints on payroll and freedoms to contract, revenue sharing, territorial rights, and the supply of talent. We also note subsequent industry developments Rottenberg could not have anticipated and identify where he was ahead of his time.
