Title: Are Americans Saving "Optimally" for Retirement?
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 607-643
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: We solve each household's optimal saving decisions using a life cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefits. With optimal decision rules, we compare, household by household, wealth predictions from the life cycle model using a nationally representative sample. We find, making use of household-specific earnings histories, that the model accounts for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth. Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small.

Title: Firms as Clubs in Walrasian Markets with Private Information
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 644-671
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: We incorporate multiagent, principal-agent theory into general equilibrium analysis. The traded commodities are multiagent contracts that include a description of the individual's job, effort level, and state-contingent consumption. These contracts are club goods. The competitive equilibrium and the Pareto program are formulated. The contracts are identified with firms, so the market determines which firms exist and who is assigned to which firm in what capacity. An example is provided in which the internal organization of firms and the distribution of firm classes vary with the aggregate capital endowment and its distribution across agents. A simplex-based algorithm for solving the Pareto program is developed.

Title: Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over? Long-Term Effects of <I>In Utero</I> Influenza Exposure in the Post-1940 U.S. Population
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 672-712
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: This paper uses the 1918 influenza pandemic as a natural experiment for testing the fetal origins hypothesis. The pandemic arrived unexpectedly in the fall of 1918 and had largely subsided by January 1919, generating sharp predictions for long-term effects. Data from the 1960&ndash;80 decennial U.S. Census indicate that cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts. These results indicate that investments in fetal health can increase human capital.

Title: Dynamic Pricing of New Experience Goods
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 713-743
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of experience goods pricing with independent private valuations. We show that the optimal paths of sales and prices can be described in terms of a simple dichotomy. In a mass market, prices are declining over time. In a niche market, the optimal prices are initially low followed by higher prices that extract surplus from the buyers with a high willingness to pay. We consider extensions of the model to integrate elements of social rather than private learning and turnover among buyers.

Title: The Impact of an Abortion Ban on Socioeconomic Outcomes of Children: Evidence from Romania
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 744-773
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: This study examines educational and labor outcomes of children affected by a ban on abortions. I use evidence from Romania, where in 1966 dictator Nicolae Ceauescu declared abortion and family planning illegal. Birth rates doubled in 1967 because formerly abortion had been the primary method of birth control. Children born after the abortion ban attained more years of schooling and greater labor market success. The reason is that urban, educated women were more likely to have abortions prior to the policy change, and the relative number of children born to this type of woman increased after the ban. However, when I control for composition using observable background variables, children born after the ban on abortions had worse educational and labor market achievements as adults.

Title: Ownership Dynamics and Asset Pricing with a Large Shareholder
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 774-815
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: We analyze the optimal trading and ownership policy of a large shareholder who must trade off diversification and monitoring incentives. Without commitment, the problem is similar to durable goods monopoly: the share price today depends on expected future trades. We show that the large shareholder ultimately trades to the competitive price-taking allocation, even though it entails inefficient monitoring. With continuous trading, the large shareholder trades immediately to this allocation if moral hazard is weak enough that her private valuation of a share is decreasing in her stake. Otherwise, the large shareholder adjusts her stake gradually. We consider implications for asset pricing, IPO underpricing, and lockup provisions.

Title: Green Markets and Private Provision of Public Goods
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 816-845
Issue: 4
Volume: 114
Year: 2006
Month: August
Abstract: This paper develops a general model of private provision of a public good that includes the option to consume an impure public good. The model is used to investigate the positive and normative consequences of "green markets," which are based on technologies with joint production of a private good and an environmental public good. It is shown that under reasonable conditions green markets can have beneficial or detrimental effects on environmental quality and social welfare. The analysis applies equally to nonenvironmental choice settings, with examples ranging from socially responsible investments to commercial activities associated with charitable fund-raising.
