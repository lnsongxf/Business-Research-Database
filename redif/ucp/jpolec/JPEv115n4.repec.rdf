Title: Intergenerational Risk Sharing in the Spirit of Arrow, Debreu, and Rawls, with Applications to Social Security Design 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the optimal allocation of risk in an
 overlapping-generations economy. It compares the allocation of risk the
 economy reaches naturally to the allocation that would be reached if
 generations behind a Rawlsian "veil of ignorance" could share risk with
 one another through complete Arrow-Debreu contingent-claims markets. The
 paper then examines how the government might implement optimal
 intergenerational risk sharing with a social security system. One
 conclusion is that the system must either hold equity claims to capital or
 negatively index benefits to equity returns. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Immigration and Prices 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the behavior of prices following the unexpected
 arrival of a large number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU)
 to Israel during 1990. I use store-level price data on 915 consumer price
 index products to show that the increase in aggregate demand prompted by
 the arrival of the FSU immigration significantly reduced prices during
 1990. When one controls for native population size and city and month
 effects, a one-percentage-point increase in the ratio of immigrants to
 natives in a city decreases prices by 0.5 percentage point on average. It
 is argued that this negative immigration effect is consistent with FSU
 immigrants-the new consumers-having higher price elasticities and lower
 search costs than the native population. Thus immigration can have a
 moderating effect on inflation through its direct effect on product
 markets, and not only by increasing the supply of labor. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: International Financial Adjustment 
Abstract:
 We explore the implications of a country's external constraint for the
 dynamics of net foreign assets, returns, and exchange rates.
 Deteriorations in external accounts imply future trade surpluses (trade
 channel) or excess returns on the net foreign portfolio (valuation
 channel). Using a new data set on U.S. gross external positions, we find
 that stabilizing valuation effects contribute 27 percent of the cyclical
 external adjustment. Our approach has asset-pricing implications: external
 imbalances predict net foreign portfolio returns one quarter to two years
 ahead and net export growth at longer horizons. The exchange rate is
 forecastable in and out of sample at one quarter and beyond. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: On the Segmentation of Markets 
Abstract:
 This paper endogenizes the market structure of an economy with
 heterogeneous agents who want to form bilateral matches in the presence of
 search frictions and when utility is nontransferable. There exist
 infinitely many marketplaces, and each agent chooses which marketplace to
 be in: agents get to choose not only whom to match with but also whom they
 meet with. Perfect segmentation is obtained in equilibrium, where agents
 match with the first person they meet. All equilibria have the same
 matching pattern. Although perfect assortative matching is not obtained in
 equilibrium, the degree of assortativeness is greater than in standard
 models. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: A Unified Framework for Measuring Preferences for Schools and Neighborhoods 
Abstract:
 This paper develops a framework for estimating household preferences for
 school and neighborhood attributes in the presence of sorting. It embeds a
 boundary discontinuity design in a heterogeneous residential choice model,
 addressing the endogeneity of school and neighborhood characteristics. The
 model is estimated using restricted-access Census data from a large
 metropolitan area, yielding a number of new results. First, households are
 willing to pay less than 1 percent more in house prices-substantially
 lower than previous estimates-when the average performance of the local
 school increases by 5 percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to
 pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the
 correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved
 neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly
 into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood
 percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks
 live in unobservably lower-quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is
 considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with
 households preferring to self-segregate on the basis of both race and
 education. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
