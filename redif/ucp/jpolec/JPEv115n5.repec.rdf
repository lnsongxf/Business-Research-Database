Title: Down or Out: Assessing the Welfare Costs of Household Investment Mistakes 
Abstract:
 This paper investigates the efficiency of household investment decisions
 using comprehensive disaggregated Swedish data. We consider two main
 sources of inefficiency: underdiversification ("down") and
 nonparticipation in risky asset markets ("out"). While a few households
 are very poorly diversified, most Swedish households outperform the Sharpe
 ratio of their domestic stock index through international diversification.
 Financially sophisticated households invest more efficiently but also more
 aggressively, and overall they incur higher return losses from
 underdiversification. The return cost of nonparticipation is smaller by
 almost one-half when we take account of the fact that nonparticipants
 would likely be inefficient investors. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: A Theory of Partially Directed Search 
Abstract:
 This article studies a search model of the labor market in which firms
 have private information about the quality of their vacancies, they can
 costlessly communicate with unemployed workers before the beginning of the
 application process, but the content of the communication does not
 constitute a contractual obligation. At the end of the application
 process, wages are determined as the outcome of an alternating offer
 bargaining game. The model is used to show that vague noncontractual
 announcements about compensation-such as those one is likely to find in
 help wanted ads-can be correlated with actual wages and can partially
 direct the search strategy of workers. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: A Model of Job and Worker Flows 
Abstract:
 We develop an equilibrium search model that incorporates job-to-job
 transitions, exhibits instances of replacement hiring, and conceptually
 distinguishes between job and worker flows. We propose a notion of
 competitive equilibrium for random-matching environments and study the
 extent to which it achieves an efficient allocation of resources. The
 model can be used to study how the permanent incomes and employment states
 of individual workers evolve over time, the amount of worker turnover in
 excess of job reallocation, the lengths of job tenures and unemployment
 durations, and the size and persistence of changes in workers' incomes
 following displacements or job-to-job transitions. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Chutes or Ladders? A Longitudinal Analysis of Immigrant Earnings 
Abstract:
 I use longitudinal earnings data from Social Security records to study the
 effect of selective emigration on the measured progress of immigrants to
 the United States. The immigrant-native earnings gap closes by 10-15
 percent during immigrants' first 20 years in the United States, or about
 half as fast as typical estimates from repeated cross sections of the
 decennial census. The divergent results indicate that emigration by
 low-wage immigrants has systematically led past researchers to
 overestimate the wage progress of immigrants who remain in the United
 States. Selective back-and-forth migration also leads typical estimates to
 overstate the measured decline in earnings among successive immigrant
 arrival cohorts between 1960 and 1980. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Sorting It Out: International Trade with Heterogeneous Workers 
Abstract:
 Each worker brings a bundle of skills to the workplace, for example,
 quantitative and communication skills. Since employers must take this
 bundle as a package deal, they choose workers with just the right mix of
 skills. We show that international differences in the distribution of
 worker skill bundles-for example, Japan's abundance of workers with a
 modest mix of both quantitative and teamwork skills-have important
 implications for international trade, industrial structure, and domestic
 income distribution. Formally, we model two-dimensional worker
 heterogeneity and show that the second moments of the distribution of
 skills are critical, as in the Roy model. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
