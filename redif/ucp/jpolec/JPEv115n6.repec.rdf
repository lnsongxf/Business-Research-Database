Title: Corruption, Norms, and Legal Enforcement: Evidence from Diplomatic Parking Tickets 
Abstract:
 We study cultural norms and legal enforcement in controlling corruption by
 analyzing the parking behavior of United Nations officials in Manhattan.
 Until 2002, diplomatic immunity protected UN diplomats from parking
 enforcement actions, so diplomats' actions were constrained by cultural
 norms alone. We find a strong effect of corruption norms: diplomats from
 high-corruption countries (on the basis of existing survey-based indices)
 accumulated significantly more unpaid parking violations. In 2002,
 enforcement authorities acquired the right to confiscate diplomatic
 license plates of violators. Unpaid violations dropped sharply in
 response. Cultural norms and (particularly in this context) legal
 enforcement are both important determinants of corruption. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: An-arrgh-chy: The Law and Economics of Pirate Organization 
Abstract:
 This article investigates the internal governance institutions of violent
 criminal enterprise by examining the law, economics, and organization of
 pirates. To effectively organize their banditry, pirates required
 mechanisms to prevent internal predation, minimize crew conflict, and
 maximize piratical profit. Pirates devised two institutions for this
 purpose. First, I analyze the system of piratical checks and balances
 crews used to constrain captain predation. Second, I examine how pirates
 used democratic constitutions to minimize conflict and create piratical
 law and order. Pirate governance created sufficient order and cooperation
 to make pirates one of the most sophisticated and successful criminal
 organizations in history. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Structuring and Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Role of a Bankruptcy Regime 
Abstract:
 In an environment characterized by weak contractual enforcement, sovereign
 lenders can enhance the likelihood of repayment by making their claims
 more difficult to restructure ex post. We show, however, that competition
 for repayment between lenders may result in a sovereign debt that is
 excessively difficult to restructure in equilibrium. This inefficiency may
 be alleviated by a suitably designed bankruptcy regime that facilitates
 debt restructuring. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Disease and Development: The Effect of Life Expectancy on Economic Growth 
Abstract:
 We exploit the major international health improvements from the 1940s to
 estimate the effect of life expectancy on economic performance. We
 construct predicted mortality using preintervention mortality rates from
 various diseases and dates of global interventions. Predicted mortality
 has a large impact on changes in life expectancy starting in 1940 but no
 effect before 1940. Using predicted mortality as an instrument, we find
 that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy leads to a 1.7-2 percent
 increase in population. Life expectancy has a much smaller effect on total
 GDP, however. Consequently, there is no evidence that the large increase
 in life expectancy raised income per capita. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Reaction of Consumer Spending and Debt to Tax Rebates-Evidence from Consumer Credit Data 
Abstract:
 We use a new panel data set of credit card accounts to analyze how
 consumers responded to the 2001 federal income tax rebates. We estimate
 the monthly response of credit card payments, spending, and debt,
 exploiting the unique, randomized timing of the rebate disbursement. We
 find that, on average, consumers initially saved some of the rebate, by
 increasing their credit card payments and thereby paying down debt. But
 soon afterward their spending increased, counter to the permanent income
 model. Spending rose most for consumers who were initially most likely to
 be liquidity constrained, whereas debt declined most (so saving rose most)
 for unconstrained consumers. (c) 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
