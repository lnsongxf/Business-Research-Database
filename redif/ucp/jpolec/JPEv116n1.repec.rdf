Title: Voter Influence and Big Policy Change: The Positive Political Economy of the New Deal 
Abstract:
 What conditions cause major policy changes under representative
 government? This article addresses that question by providing a
 theoretically grounded analysis of a massive policy change: the New Deal.
 It explains how the economic problems of the early 1930s initiated changes
 on several dimensions of policy: federal spending, labor market
 regulation, and civil rights. The article concludes by considering the
 broader lessons learned from the political economy of the New Deal. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Birth Control and Female Empowerment: An Equilibrium Analysis 
Abstract:
 We analyze, from a theoretical perspective, the impact of innovations in
 birth control technology on intrahousehold allocation of resources. We
 consider a model of frictionless matching on the marriage market in which
 men, as well as women, differ in their preferences for children; moreover,
 men, unlike women, must marry to enjoy fatherhood. We show that more
 efficient birth control technologies generally increase the "power," hence
 the welfare, of all women, including those who do not use them. This
 "empowerment" effect requires that the new technology be available to
 single women. An innovation reserved to married women may result in a
 "disempowerment" effect. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy: Equivalence Results 
Abstract:
 In this article, we analyze the implications of price-setting restrictions
 for the conduct of cyclical fiscal and monetary policy. We consider
 standard monetary economies that differ in the price-setting restrictions
 imposed on the firms. We show that, independently of the degree or type of
 price stickiness, it is possible to implement the same efficient set of
 allocations and that each allocation in that set is implemented with
 policies that are also independent of the price stickiness. In this sense,
 environments with different price-setting restrictions are equivalent. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Effect of Driving Restrictions on Air Quality in Mexico City 
Abstract:
 In 1989, the government of Mexico City introduced a program, Hoy No
 Circula, that bans most drivers from using their vehicles one weekday per
 week on the basis of the last digit of the vehicle's license plate. This
 article measures the effect of the driving restrictions on air quality
 using high-frequency measures from monitoring stations. Across pollutants
 and specifications there is no evidence that the restrictions have
 improved air quality. Evidence from additional sources indicates that the
 restrictions led to an increase in the total number of vehicles in
 circulation as well as a change in composition toward high-emissions
 vehicles. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: On the Optimality of the Friedman Rule with Heterogeneous Agents and Nonlinear Income Taxation 
Abstract:
 We study the optimal inflation tax in an economy with heterogeneous agents
 subject to nonlinear taxation of labor income. We find that the Friedman
 rule is Pareto efficient when combined with a nondecreasing labor income
 tax. In addition, the optimum for a utilitarian social welfare function
 lies on this region of the Pareto frontier. The welfare costs from
 inflation are bounded below by the area under the demand curve. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
