Title: Moral Hazard versus Liquidity and Optimal Unemployment Insurance 
Abstract:
 This paper presents new evidence on why unemployment insurance (UI)
 benefits affect search behavior and develops a simple method of
 calculating the welfare gains from UI using this evidence. I show that 60
 percent of the increase in unemployment durations caused by UI benefits is
 due to a "liquidity effect" rather than distortions on marginal incentives
 to search ("moral hazard") by combining two empirical strategies. First, I
 find that increases in benefits have much larger effects on durations for
 liquidity-constrained households. Second, lump-sum severance payments
 increase durations substantially among constrained households. I derive a
 formula for the optimal benefit level that depends only on the
 reduced-form liquidity and moral hazard elasticities. The formula implies
 that the optimal UI benefit level exceeds 50 percent of the wage. The
 "exact identification" approach to welfare analysis proposed here yields
 robust optimal policy results because it does not require structural
 estimation of primitives. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Structural Transformation and the Deterioration of European Labor Market Outcomes 
Abstract:
 This paper examines hours worked in continental Europe and the United
 States from 1956 to 2003. The empirical work establishes two results.
 First, hours worked in Europe decline by almost 45 percent compared to the
 United States over this period. Second, this decline is almost entirely
 accounted for by the fact that Europe develops a much smaller market
 service sector than the United States. A simple model of time allocation
 is used to understand these patterns. I find that relative increases in
 taxes and technological catch-up can account for most of the differences
 between the European and American time allocations over this period. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Consumption Strikes Back? Measuring Long-Run Risk 
Abstract:
 We characterize and measure a long-term risk-return trade-off for the
 valuation of cash flows exposed to fluctuations in macroeconomic growth.
 This trade-off features risk prices of cash flows that are realized far
 into the future but continue to be reflected in asset values. We apply
 this analysis to claims on aggregate cash flows and to cash flows from
 value and growth portfolios by imputing values to the long-run dynamic
 responses of cash flows to macroeconomic shocks. We explore the
 sensitivity of our results to features of the economic valuation model and
 of the model cash flow dynamics. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Sources of Advantageous Selection: Evidence from the Medigap Insurance Market 
Abstract:
 We provide evidence of advantageous selection in the Medigap insurance
 market and analyze its sources. Conditional on controls for Medigap
 prices, those with Medigap spend, on average, $4,000 less on medical care
 than those without. But if we condition on health, those with Medigap
 spend $2,000 more. The sources of this advantageous selection include
 income, education, longevity expectations, and financial planning
 horizons, as well as cognitive ability. Conditional on all these factors,
 those with higher expected medical expenditures are more likely to
 purchase Medigap. Risk preferences do not appear as a source of
 advantageous selection; cognitive ability is particularly important. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Vote Buying: General Elections 
Abstract:
 We examine the consequences of vote buying, assuming this practice were
 allowed and free of stigma. Two parties compete in a binary election and
 may purchase votes in a sequential bidding game via up-front binding
 payments and/or campaign promises (platforms) that are contingent on the
 outcome of the election. We analyze the role of the parties' and voters'
 preferences in determining the winner and the payments to voters. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
