Title: The Effect of Low-Skilled Immigration on U.S. Prices: Evidence from CPI Data 
Abstract:
 I exploit the large variation across U.S. cities and through time in the
 relative size of the low-skilled immigrant population to estimate the
 causal effect of immigration on prices of nontraded goods and services.
 Using an instrumental variables strategy, I find that, at current
 immigration levels, a 10 percent increase in the share of low-skilled
 immigrants in the labor force decreases the price of immigrant-intensive
 services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 2 percent. Wage equations
 suggest that lower wages are a likely channel through which these effects
 take place. However, wage effects are significantly larger for low-skilled
 immigrants than for low-skilled natives, implying that the two are
 imperfect substitutes. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Spatial Competition with Heterogeneous Firms 
Abstract:
 I model endogenous horizontal and vertical product differentiation with
 arbitrarily many heterogeneous firms. Firms are asymmetric in that they
 differ in their marginal costs. I prove that under an equilibrium
 refinement, all economically relevant firm outcomes are uniquely
 determined across all strict subgame perfect Nash equilibria. There are
 two central results. First, a firm's price, market share, and profit are
 independent of its neighbors' marginal costs, conditional on the average
 marginal cost in the market. Second, more productive firms are more
 isolated, all else equal. In particular, the distance between two firms is
 strictly decreasing in their average marginal cost. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Capital Deepening and Nonbalanced Economic Growth 
Abstract:
 We present a model of nonbalanced growth based on differences in factor
 proportions and capital deepening. Capital deepening increases the
 relative output of the more capital-intensive sector but simultaneously
 induces a reallocation of capital and labor away from that sector. Using a
 two-sector general equilibrium model, we show that nonbalanced growth is
 consistent with an asymptotic equilibrium with a constant interest rate
 and capital share in national income. For plausible parameter values, the
 model generates dynamics consistent with U.S. data, in particular, faster
 growth of employment and slower growth of output in less capital-intensive
 sectors, and aggregate behavior consistent with the Kaldor facts. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Stature and Status: Height, Ability, and Labor Market Outcomes 
Abstract:
 The well-known association between height and earnings is often thought to
 reflect factors such as self-esteem, social dominance, and discrimination.
 We offer a simpler explanation: height is positively associated with
 cognitive ability, which is rewarded in the labor market. Using data from
 the United States and the United Kingdom, we show that taller children
 have higher average cognitive test scores and that these test scores
 explain a large portion of the height premium in earnings. Children who
 have higher test scores also experience earlier adolescent growth spurts,
 so that height in adolescence serves as a marker of cognitive ability. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: A Phillips Curve with an Ss Foundation 
Abstract:
 We develop an analytically tractable Phillips curve based on
 state-dependent pricing. We consider a local approximation around a zero
 inflation steady state and introduce infrequent idiosyncratic shocks. The
 resulting Phillips curve is a simple variant of the conventional
 time-dependent Calvo formulation with important differences. First, the
 model is able to match the micro evidence on the magnitude and timing of
 price adjustments. Second, our state-dependent model exhibits greater
 flexibility in the aggregate price level than the time-dependent model.
 With real rigidities present, however, our model can exhibit nominal
 stickiness similar to a conventional time-dependent model. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
