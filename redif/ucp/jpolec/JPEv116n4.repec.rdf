Title: The Depressing Effect of Agricultural Institutions on the Prewar Japanese Economy 
Abstract:
 Why didn't the Japanese miracle take place before World War II? The
 culprit we identify is a barrier that kept prewar agricultural employment
 constant. Using a standard neoclassical two-sector growth model, we show
 that the barrier-induced sectoral distortion and an ensuring lack of
 capital accumulation account well for the depressed output level. Without
 the barrier, Japan's prewar GNP per worker would have been at least about
 a half of that of the United States, not about a third as in the data. The
 labor barrier existed because, we argue, the prewar patriarchy forced the
 son designated as heir to stay in agriculture. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Measuring Illegal Activity and the Effects of Regulatory Innovation: Tax Evasion and the Dyeing of Untaxed Diesel 
Abstract:
 This article examines tax evasion in the diesel fuel market. Diesel fuel
 used for on-road purposes is taxed, while other uses are untaxed, creating
 an incentive for firms and individuals to evade on-road diesel taxes by
 purchasing untaxed diesel fuel and then using it for on-road use. We
 examine the effects of a federal regulatory innovation in October 1993,
 the addition of red dye to untaxed diesel fuel at the point of
 distribution, which significantly lowered the cost of regulatory
 enforcement. We find that sales of diesel fuel rose 26 percent following
 the regulatory change, while sales of heating oil, which is an untaxed
 perfect substitute, fell by a similar amount. The effect on sales was
 higher in states with higher tax rates and in states likely to have higher
 audit costs. We also find evidence that heating oil sales were less
 responsive to demand factors, such as temperature, prior to the dye
 program, indicating that a significant fraction of predye sales was
 illegitimate. Furthermore, we find a pattern of price and tax elasticities
 consistent with innovation in new evasion techniques subsequent to the
 regulatory change. Finally, we estimate that the elasticity of tax
 revenues with respect to the tax rate was 0.60 prior to the dye program
 yet would have been 0.85 in the absence of evasion. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Inefficient Unemployment Dynamics under Asymmetric Information 
Abstract:
 I explore the efficiency properties of a competitive search model with
 match-specific private information and limited commitment on the workers'
 side. In a static setting the competitive search equilibrium is
 constrained efficient, whereas in a dynamic setting it is constrained
 inefficient whenever the initial unemployment rate is different from its
 steady-state level. Inefficiency arises because the workers' outside
 option becomes endogenous and affects the severity of the distortion due
 to the informational friction. This generates a novel externality: firms
 offering contracts at a given time do not internalize their effect on the
 outside option of workers hired in previous periods. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Universal Child Care, Maternal Labor Supply, and Family Well-Being 
Abstract:
 We analyze the introduction of highly subsidized, universally accessible
 child care in Quebec, addressing the impact on child care utilization,
 maternal labor supply, and family well-being. We find strong evidence of a
 shift into new child care use, although some crowding out of existing
 arrangements is evident. Maternal labor supply increases significantly.
 Finally, the evidence suggests that children are worse off by measures
 ranging from aggression to motor and social skills to illness. We also
 uncover evidence that the new child care program led to more hostile, less
 consistent parenting, worse parental health, and lower-quality parental
 relationships. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Child Protection and Adult Crime: Using Investigator Assignment to Estimate Causal Effects of Foster Care 
Abstract:
 This paper uses the randomization of families to child protection
 investigators to estimate causal effects of foster care on adult crime.
 The analysis uses a new data set that links criminal justice data to child
 protection data in Illinois, and I find that investigators affect foster
 care placement. Children on the margin of placement are found to be two to
 three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if
 they were placed in foster care. One innovation describes the types of
 children on the margin of placement, a group that is more likely to
 include African Americans, girls, and young adolescents. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
