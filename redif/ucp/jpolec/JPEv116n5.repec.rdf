Title: Prejudice and Wages: An Empirical Assessment of Becker's The Economics of Discrimination 
Abstract:
 We test the predictions from Becker's (1957) seminal work on employer prejudice and find that
 relative black wages (a) vary negatively with the prejudice of the
 "marginal" white in a state, (b) vary negatively with the prejudice in the
 lower tail of the prejudice distribution but are unaffected by the
 prejudice of the most prejudiced persons in a state, and (c) vary
 negatively with the fraction of a state that is black. Our estimates
 suggest that one-quarter of the racial wage gap is due to prejudice, with
 nontrivial consequences for black lifetime earnings. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: An Economic Index of Riskiness 
Abstract:
 Define the riskiness of a gamble as the reciprocal of the absolute risk
 aversion (ARA) of an individual with constant ARA who is indifferent
 between taking and not taking that gamble. We characterize this index by
 axioms, chief among them a "duality" axiom that, roughly speaking, asserts
 that less risk-averse individuals accept riskier gambles. The index is
 positively homogeneous, continuous, and subadditive; respects first- and
 second-order stochastic dominance; and for normally distributed gambles is
 half of variance/mean. Examples are calculated, additional properties are
 derived, and the index is compared with others. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Input and Technology Choices in Regulated Industries: Evidence from the Health Care Sector 
Abstract:
 This paper examines the implications of regulatory change for input mix
 and technology choices of regulated industries. We study the increase in
 the relative price of labor faced by U.S. hospitals that resulted from the
 move from full cost to partial cost reimbursement under the Medicare
 Prospective Payment System (PPS) reform. Using the interaction of
 hospitals' pre-PPS Medicare share of patient days with the introduction of
 PPS, we document substantial increases in capital-labor ratios and
 declines in labor inputs following PPS. Most interestingly, we find that
 PPS seems to have encouraged the adoption of a range of new medical
 technologies. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Early Marriage, Age of Menarche, and Female Schooling Attainment in Bangladesh 
Abstract:
 Using data from rural Bangladesh, we explore the hypothesis that women
 attain less schooling as a result of social and financial pressure to
 marry young. We isolate the causal effect of marriage timing using age of
 menarche as an instrumental variable. Our results indicate that each
 additional year that marriage is delayed is associated with 0.22
 additional year of schooling and 5.6 percent higher literacy. Delayed
 marriage is also associated with an increase in use of preventive health
 services. In the context of competitive marriage markets, we use the above
 results to obtain estimates of the change in equilibrium female education
 that would arise from introducing age of consent laws. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Intertemporal Cost Allocation and Investment Decisions 
Abstract:
 This paper considers the profit-maximization problem of a firm that must
 make sunk investments in long-lived assets to produce output. It is shown
 that if per-period accounting income is calculated using a simple and
 natural allocation rule for investment, called the relative replacement
 cost (RRC) rule, under a broad range of plausible circumstances, the firm
 can choose the fully optimal sequence of investments over time simply by
 choosing a level of investment each period in order to maximize the next
 period's accounting income. Furthermore, in a model in which shareholders
 delegate the investment decision to a better-informed manager, it is shown
 that if accounting income based on the RRC allocation rule is used as a
 performance measure for the manager, robust incentives are created for the
 manager to choose the profit-maximizing sequence of investments,
 regardless of the manager's own personal discount rate or other aspects of
 the manager's personal preferences. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Small World of Investing: Board Connections and Mutual Fund Returns 
Abstract:
 This paper uses social networks to identify information transfer in
 security markets. We focus on connections between mutual fund managers and
 corporate board members via shared education networks. We find that
 portfolio managers place larger bets on connected firms and perform
 significantly better on these holdings relative to their nonconnected
 holdings. A replicating portfolio of connected stocks outperforms
 nonconnected stocks by up to 7.8 percent per year. Returns are
 concentrated around corporate news announcements, consistent with
 portfolio managers gaining an informational advantage through the
 education networks. Our results suggest that social networks may be
 important mechanisms for information flow into asset prices. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
