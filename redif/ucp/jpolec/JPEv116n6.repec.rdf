Title: Strategic Ambiguity and Arms Proliferation 
Abstract:
 A big power is facing a small power that may have developed weapons of
 mass destruction. The small power can create strategic ambiguity by
 refusing arms inspections. We study the impact of strategic ambiguity on
 arms proliferation and welfare. Strategic ambiguity is a substitute for
 actually acquiring weapons: ambiguity reduces the incentive for the small
 power to invest in weapons, which reduces the threat of arms
 proliferation. But strategic ambiguity hides information, and this can
 lead to costly mistakes. Cheap-talk messages can be used to trigger
 inspections when such mistakes are particularly costly. Tough messages
 that trigger inspections always imply a greater risk of arms
 proliferation. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Demographic Transition and the Sexual Division of Labor 
Abstract:
 This paper presents a theory in which increases in female labor force
 participation and reductions in the gender-wage gap are generated as part
 of a single process of demographic transition, initially characterized by
 reductions in mortality and fertility. The paper suggests a relationship
 between gains in life expectancy and changes in the role of women in
 society that has not been identified before in the literature. Mortality
 reductions affect the incentives of individuals to invest in human capital
 and to have children, with implications for female labor force
 participation and the wage differential between men and women. The paper
 also presents some empirical evidence to support the predictions of the
 theory. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Debt Enforcement around the World 
Abstract:
 Insolvency practitioners from 88 countries describe how debt enforcement
 will proceed against an identical hotel about to default on its debt. We
 use the data on time, cost, and the likely disposition of the assets
 (preservation as a going concern vs. piecemeal sale) to construct a
 measure of the efficiency of debt enforcement in each country. This
 measure is strongly correlated with per capita income and legal origin and
 predicts debt market development. Several characteristics of debt
 enforcement procedures, such as the structure of appeals and availability
 of floating charge finance, influence efficiency. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Place of Work and Place of Residence: Informal Hiring Networks and Labor Market Outcomes 
Abstract:
 We use a novel research design to empirically detect the effect of social
 interactions on labor market outcomes. Using Census data on residential
 and employment locations, we examine whether individuals residing in the
 same city block are more likely to work together than those in nearby
 blocks. We find evidence of significant social interactions. The estimated
 referral effect is stronger when individuals are similar in
 sociodemographic characteristics. These findings are robust across
 specifications intended to address sorting and reverse causation. Further,
 the increased availability of neighborhood referrals has a significant
 impact on a wide range of labor market outcomes. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Profits of Power: Land Rights and Agricultural Investment in Ghana 
Abstract:
 We examine the impact of ambiguous and contested land rights on investment
 and productivity in agriculture in Akwapim, Ghana. We show that
 individuals who hold powerful positions in a local political hierarchy
 have more secure tenure rights and that as a consequence they invest more
 in land fertility and have substantially higher output. The intensity of
 investments on different plots cultivated by a given individual
 corresponds to that individual's security of tenure over those specific
 plots and, in turn, to the individual's position in the political
 hierarchy relevant to those specific plots. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
