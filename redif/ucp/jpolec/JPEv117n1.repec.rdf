Title: Brand History, Geography, and the Persistence of Brand Shares 
Abstract:
 We document evidence of a persistent "early entry" advantage for brands in
 34 consumer packaged goods industries across the 50 largest U.S. cities.
 Current market shares are higher in markets closest to a brand's historic
 city of origin than in those farthest. For six industries, we know the
 order of entry among the top brands in each of the markets. We find an
 early entry effect on a brand's current market share and perceived quality
 across U.S. cities. The magnitude of this effect typically drives the rank
 order of market shares and perceived quality levels across cities. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Unemployment Fluctuations with Staggered Nash Wage Bargaining 
Abstract:
 A number of authors have argued that the conventional model of
 unemployment dynamics due to Mortensen and Pissarides has difficulty
 accounting for the relatively volatile behavior of labor market activity
 over the business cycle. We address this issue by modifying the
 Mortensen-Pissarides framework to allow for staggered multiperiod wage
 contracting. What emerges is a tractable relation for wage dynamics that
 is a natural generalization of the period-by-period Nash bargaining
 outcome in the conventional formulation. We then show that a reasonable
 calibration of the model can account for the cyclical behavior of wages
 and labor market activity observed in the data. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Does Competition Reduce Price Dispersion? New Evidence from the Airline Industry 
Abstract:
 We analyze the effects of competition on price dispersion in the airline
 industry, using panel data from 1993:Q1 through 2006:Q3. Competition has a
 negative effect on price dispersion, in line with the textbook treatment
 of price discrimination. This effect is pronounced for routes with
 consumers characterized by relatively heterogeneous elasticities of
 demand. On routes with a homogeneous customer base, the effects of
 competition on price dispersion are smaller. Our results contrast with
 those of Borenstein and Rose, who found that price dispersion increases
 with competition. We reconcile the different results by showing that the
 cross-sectional estimator suffers from omitted-variable bias. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Coalition-Proof Trade and the Friedman Rule in the Lagos-Wright Model 
Abstract:
 The Lagos-Wright model-a monetary model in which pairwise meetings
 alternate in time with a centralized meeting-has been extensively
 analyzed, but always using particular trading protocols. Here, trading
 protocols are replaced by two alternative notions of implementability: one
 that allows only individual defections and one that also allows
 cooperative defections in meetings. It is shown that the first-best
 allocation is implementable under the stricter notion without taxation if
 people are sufficiently patient. And, if people are free to skip the
 centralized meeting, then lump-sum taxation used to pay interest on money
 does not enlarge the set of implementable allocations. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Incidence of U.S. Agricultural Subsidies on Farmland Rental Rates 
Abstract:
 Who benefits from agricultural subsidies is an open question. Economic
 theory predicts that the entire subsidy incidence should be on the
 farmland owners. Using a complementary set of policy quasi experiments, I
 find that farmers who rent the land they cultivate capture 75 percent of
 the subsidy, leaving just 25 percent for landowners. This finding
 contradicts the prediction from neoclassical models. The standard
 prediction may not hold because of less than perfect competition in the
 farmland rental market; the share captured by landowners increases with
 local measures of competitiveness in the farmland rental market. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
