Title: The Conquest of South American Inflation 
Abstract:
 We infer determinants of Latin American hyperinflations and stabilizations
 by using the method of maximum likelihood to estimate a hidden Markov
 model that assigns roles both to fundamentals in the form of government
 deficits that are financed by money creation and to destabilizing
 expectations dynamics that can occasionally divorce inflation from
 fundamentals. Levels and conditional volatilities of monetized deficits
 drove most hyperinflations and stabilizations, with a notable exception in
 Peru, where a cosmetic reform of the type emphasized by Marcet and
 Nicolini occurred. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Branch Banking as a Device for Discipline: Competition and Bank Survivorship during the Great Depression 
Abstract:
 Because California was a pioneer in the development of large-scale
 branching, we use its experience during the 1920s and 1930s to assess the
 effects of branching on competition and on the stability of banking
 systems. Using individual bank balance sheets, income statements, and
 branch establishment data, we show that smaller incumbent banks responded
 to the entry of a large branch bank by adjusting their operations in a
 manner consistent with increased efficiency. Competition from branching
 networks also produced an externality: unit banks exposed to this
 competition were more likely to survive the Great Depression than banks
 not exposed to it. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Reconciling Cyclical Movements in the Marginal Value of Time and the Marginal Product of Labor 
Abstract:
 Recessions appear to be times when the marginal rate of substitution
 between goods and workers' time falls below the marginal product of labor.
 If so, the allocation of workers' time is inefficient. I develop a model
 of households and production that reconciles cyclical movements in the
 marginal value of time and the marginal product. The model embodies the
 findings of research that the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is less
 than one. It treats unemployment in a search-and-matching setup.
 Recessions do not result in private inefficiency in the allocation of
 labor, but the unemployment rate may be socially inefficiently high. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Information and the Skewness of Music Sales 
Abstract:
 This paper studies the role of product discovery in the demand for
 recorded music. We show that releasing a new album causes a substantial
 and permanent increase in sales of the artist's old albums-especially if
 the new release is a hit. Patterns in these "backward spillovers" suggest
 that they result from consumers discovering the artist upon hearing the
 new release. To explore the implications of consumers' incomplete
 information, we estimate a simple, learning-based model of market demand.
 Our results imply that the distribution of sales is substantially more
 skewed than it would be if consumers were more fully informed. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Deterrent Effects of Prison: Evidence from a Natural Experiment 
Abstract:
 The Collective Clemency Bill passed by the Italian Parliament in July 2006
 represents a natural experiment to analyze the behavioral response of
 individuals to an exogenous manipulation of prison sentences. On the basis
 of a unique data set on the postrelease behavior of former inmates, we
 find that 1 month less time served in prison commuted into 1 month more in
 expected sentence for future crimes reduces the probability of recidivism
 by 0.16 percentage points. From this result we estimate an elasticity of
 average recidivism with respect to the expected punishment equal to  -
 0.74 for a 7-month period. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
