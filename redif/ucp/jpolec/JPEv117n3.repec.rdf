Title: Financial Integration, Financial Development, and Global Imbalances 
Abstract:
 Global financial imbalances can result from financial integration when
 countries differ in financial markets development. Countries with more
 advanced financial markets accumulate foreign liabilities in a gradual,
 long-lasting process. Differences in financial development also affect the
 composition of foreign portfolios: countries with negative net foreign
 asset positions maintain positive net holdings of nondiversifiable equity
 and foreign direct investment. Three observations motivate our analysis:
 (1) financial development varies widely even among industrial countries,
 with the United States on top; (2) the secular decline in the U.S. net
 foreign asset position started in the early 1980s, together with a gradual
 process of international financial integration; (3) the portfolio
 composition of U.S. net foreign assets features increased holdings of
 risky assets and a large increase in debt. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Simple Economics of Extortion: Evidence from Trucking in Aceh 
Abstract:
 This paper tests whether the behavior of corrupt officials is consistent
 with standard industrial organization theory. We designed a study in which
 surveyors accompanied Indonesian truck drivers on 304 trips, during which
 they observed over 6,000 illegal payments to police, soldiers, and weigh
 station attendants. Using plausibly exogenous changes in the number of
 checkpoints, we show that market structure affects the level of illegal
 payments. We further show that corrupt officials use complex pricing
 schemes, including third-degree price discrimination and a menu of
 two-part tariffs. Our findings illustrate the importance of considering
 the market structure for bribes when designing anticorruption policy. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Myth and Reality of Flat Tax Reform: Micro Estimates of Tax Evasion Response and Welfare Effects in Russia 
Abstract:
 We examine the effects of Russia's 2001 flat rate income tax reform on
 consumption, income, and tax evasion. We use the gap between household
 expenditures and reported earnings as a proxy for tax evasion with data
 from a household panel for 1998-2004. We associate large and significant
 changes in tax evasion following the flat tax reform with changes in
 voluntary compliance. We develop a consumption-based framework to assess
 the deadweight loss from income tax in the presence of tax evasion and
 show that the efficiency gains from the reform are at least 30 percent
 smaller than the gains implied by conventional approaches. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Asset Pricing Implications of Pareto Optimality with Private Information 
Abstract:
 We compare the empirical performance of a standard incomplete markets
 asset pricing model with that of a novel model with constrained
 Pareto-optimal allocations. We represent the models' stochastic discount
 factors in terms of the cross-sectional distribution of consumption and
 use these representations to evaluate the models' empirical implications.
 The first model is inconsistent with the equity premium in the United
 States, United Kingdom, and Italy. The second model is consistent with the
 equity premium and the risk-free rate in all three countries if the
 coefficient of relative risk aversion is roughly 5 and the quarterly
 discount factor is less than 0.5. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Is the Allocation of Resources within the Household Efficient? New Evidence from a Randomized Experiment 
Abstract:
 I study whether households make Pareto-efficient intrahousehold resource
 allocation decisions. Combining randomized variation in women's income
 generated by the evaluation of the Mexican PROGRESA program with variation
 attributable to localized rainfall shocks as distribution factors in the
 collective model, I find evidence favoring Pareto optimality. More
 specifically, female-specific income changes have positive effects on
 children's goods expenditures, whereas changes due to rainfall shocks have
 a smaller influence on household public goods expenditures. The evidence
 is consistent with female partners having greater sensitivity to
 own-income changes and norms that oblige women to devote their earnings to
 meet collective consumption needs. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
