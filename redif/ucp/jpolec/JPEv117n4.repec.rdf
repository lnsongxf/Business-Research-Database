Title: Chronicle of a Deflation Unforetold 
Abstract:
 Suppose that the nominal money supply could be cut literally overnight.
 What would happen to prices, wages, and output? Such an experiment was
 carried out three times in France in 1724, resulting in a cumulative 45
 percent cut. Prices adjusted instantaneously and fully on the foreign
 exchange market. Prices of commodities and of manufactured goods and
 industrial wages fell slowly, over many months, and not by the full amount
 of the nominal reduction. The industrial sector experienced a contraction
 of 30 percent. When the government changed course and increased the
 nominal money supply overnight by 20 percent, prices responded more, and
 industry rebounded. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Unequal Geographic Burden of Federal Taxation 
Abstract:
 In the United States, workers in cities offering above-average
 wages-cities with high productivity, low quality of life, or inefficient
 housing sectors-pay 27 percent more in federal taxes than otherwise
 identical workers in cities offering below-average wages. According to
 simulation results, taxes lower long-run employment levels in high-wage
 areas by 13 percent and land and housing prices by 21 and 5 percent,
 causing locational inefficiencies costing 0.23 percent of income, or $28
 billion in 2008. Employment is shifted from north to south and from urban
 to rural areas. Tax deductions index taxes partially to local cost of
 living, improving locational efficiency. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: How Much Is a Dollar Worth? Tipping versus Equilibrium Coexistence on Competing Online Auction Sites 
Abstract:
 Theory models of platform competition predict that prices and buyer-seller
 ratios should be approximately equal on coexisting auction sites. Using
 field experiments on eBay and Yahoo Auctions, we find evidence that is
 inconsistent with equilibrium hypotheses and suggest that the market is
 tipping. Prices on eBay are consistently 20-70 percent higher than those
 on Yahoo, and eBay attracts two additional buyers per seller. On Yahoo,
 prices and bidders counts are unaffected by the auction ending rule.
 Various differences between the sites cannot account for the magnitude of
 these disparities. However, a model of imitation dynamics can rationalize
 our findings. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Trade and Capital Flows: A Financial Frictions Perspective 
Abstract:
 The classical Heckscher-Ohlin-Mundell paradigm states that trade and
 capital mobility are substitutes in the sense that trade integration
 reduces the incentives for capital to flow to capital-scarce countries. In
 this paper we show that in a world with heterogeneous financial
 development, a very different conclusion emerges. In particular, in less
 financially developed economies (South), trade and capital mobility are
 complements in the sense that trade integration increases the return to
 capital and thus the incentives for capital to flow to South. This
 interaction implies that deepening trade integration in South raises net
 capital inflows (or reduces net capital outflows). It also implies that,
 at the global level, protectionism may backfire if the goal is to
 rebalance capital flows. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Performance and Competitive Effects of School Autonomy 
Abstract:
 This paper studies a recent British reform that allowed public high
 schools to opt out of local authority control and become autonomous
 schools funded directly by the central government. Schools seeking
 autonomy had only to propose and win a majority vote among current
 parents. Almost one in three high schools voted on autonomy between 1988
 and 1997, and using a version of the regression discontinuity design, I
 find large achievement gains at schools in which the vote barely won
 compared to schools in which it barely lost. Despite other reforms that
 ensured that the British education system was, by international standards,
 highly competitive, a comparison of schools in the geographic
 neighborhoods of narrow vote winners and narrow vote losers suggests that
 these gains did not spill over. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
