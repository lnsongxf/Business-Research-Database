Title: An Operational Measure of Riskiness
Abstract: We propose a measure of riskiness of &ldquo;gambles&rdquo; (risky assets) that is objective: it depends only on the gamble and not on the decision maker. The measure is based on identifying for every gamble the critical wealth level below which it becomes &ldquo;risky&rdquo; to accept the gamble.

Title: Durability of Output and Expected Stock Returns
Abstract: The demand for durable goods is more cyclical than that for nondurable goods and services. Consequently, the cash flows and stock returns of durable&hyphen;good producers are exposed to higher systematic risk. Using the benchmark input&hyphen;output accounts of the National Income and Product Accounts, we construct portfolios of durable&hyphen;good, nondurable&hyphen;good, and service producers. In the cross section, an investment strategy that is long on the durable&hyphen;good portfolio and short on the service portfolio earns a risk premium exceeding 4 percent annually. In the time series, an investment strategy that is long on the durable&hyphen;good portfolio and short on the market portfolio earns a countercyclical risk premium. We explain these findings in a general equilibrium asset&hyphen;pricing model with endogenous production.

Title: Efficiency of Simultaneous Search 
Abstract:
 This paper presents an equilibrium labor search model in which workers can
 simultaneously apply to multiple firms to increase their search intensity.
 They observe firms' wage postings before choosing where to apply. Owing to
 coordination frictions, a firm may not receive any applications; otherwise
 it is able to hire unless all its applicants have better offers. It is
 shown that the equilibrium converges to the efficient Walrasian outcome as
 application costs vanish. Even for nonnegligible application costs, the
 entry of firms, the search intensity, and the number of filled vacancies
 are constrained efficient. Wage dispersion is essential for constrained
 efficiency. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Opinions as Incentives 
Abstract:
 We study costs and benefits of differences of opinion between an adviser
 and a decision maker. Even when they share the same underlying preferences
 over decisions, a difference of opinion about payoff-relevant information
 leads to strategic information acquisition and transmission. A decision
 maker faces a fundamental trade-off: a greater difference of opinion
 increases an adviser's incentives to acquire information but exacerbates
 the strategic disclosure of any information that is acquired.
 Nevertheless, when choosing from a rich pool of opinion types, it is
 optimal for a decision maker to select an adviser with some difference of
 opinion. Centralization of authority is essential to harness these
 incentive gains since delegation to the adviser can discourage effort. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Firm-Specific Human Capital: A Skill-Weights Approach 
Abstract:
 The theory of human capital is agnostic on what constitutes firm-specific
 skills. The theory specifies that specific skills contribute to
 productivity only at the current firm. A broader approach lets all skills
 be general, but firms use them with different weights attached. For
 example, computer programming, economics, and accounting are general
 skills, but there may be only one firm that wants workers trained in all
 three. One implication is that wage profiles and the split of human
 capital costs depend on thickness of the market. Another is that firms pay
 for what appears to be general training. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
