Title: Why Is Consumption More Log Normal than Income? Gibrat's Law Revisited 
Abstract:
 Significant departures from log normality are observed in income data, in
 violation of Gibrat's law. We show empirically that the distribution of
 consumption expenditures across households is, within cohorts, closer to
 log normal than the distribution of income. We explain this empirical
 result by showing that the logic of Gibrat's law applies not to total
 income, but to permanent income and to marginal utility. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Opening the Black Box of Intrahousehold Decision Making: Theory and Nonparametric Empirical Tests of General Collective Consumption Models 
Abstract:
 We provide "revealed preference" tests of general collective consumption
 models that account for public consumption and externalities within the
 household. We further propose a novel approach to model special cases of
 this model, which imply alternative assumptions regarding the sharing
 rule. Our application uses the panel data from the Russia Longitudinal
 Monitoring Survey. We find that the general model, together with a large
 class of special cases, cannot be rejected. By contrast, we do reject the
 standard unitary model. Since our tests are entirely nonparametric, this
 provides strong evidence in favor of models focusing on intrahousehold
 decision making. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Monetary Intervention Mitigated Banking Panics during the Great Depression: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from a Federal Reserve District Border, 1929-1933 
Abstract:
 The Federal Reserve Act divided Mississippi between the 6th (Atlanta) and
 8th (St. Louis) Districts. During the Great Depression, these districts'
 policies differed. Atlanta championed monetary activism and the extension
 of aid to ailing banks. St. Louis eschewed expansionary initiatives.
 During a banking crisis in 1930, Atlanta expedited lending to banks in
 need. St. Louis did not. Outcomes differed across districts. In Atlanta,
 banks survived at higher rates, lending continued at higher levels,
 commerce contracted less, and recovery began earlier. These patterns
 indicate that central bank intervention influenced bank health, credit
 availability, and business activity. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Investment-Based Expected Stock Returns 
Abstract:
 We derive and test q-theory implications for cross-sectional stock
 returns. Under constant returns to scale, stock returns equal levered
 investment returns, which are tied directly to firm characteristics. When
 we use generalized method of moments to match average levered investment
 returns to average observed stock returns, the model captures the average
 stock returns of portfolios sorted by earnings surprises, book-to-market
 equity, and capital investment. When we try to match expected returns and
 return variances simultaneously, the variances predicted in the model are
 largely comparable to those observed in the data. However, the resulting
 expected return errors are large. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: (Mixed) Strategy in Oligopoly Pricing: Evidence from Gasoline Price Cycles Before and Under a Timing Regulation 
Abstract:
 This paper studies oligopoly firms' dynamic pricing strategies in a
 gasoline market before and after the introduction of a unique law that
 constrains firms to set price simultaneously and only once per day. The
 observed gasoline pricing behavior, both before and under the law, is well
 captured by the Edgeworth price cycle equilibrium in the Maskin and Tirole
 dynamic oligopoly model. My results highlight the importance of price
 commitment in tacit collusion. I also find evidence that the price
 leadership outcome under the law is better predicted by mixed strategies
 play than by alternative hypotheses. (c) 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
