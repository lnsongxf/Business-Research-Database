Title: Cost Benefit Analyses versus Referenda 
Abstract:
 We consider a planner who chooses between two public policies and ask
 whether a referendum or a cost benefit analysis leads to higher welfare.
 We find that a referendum leads to higher welfare than a cost benefit
 analysis in a "common value" environment. Cost benefit analysis is better
 in a "private value" environment. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Altruism, Favoritism, and Guilt in the Allocation of Family Resources: Sophie's Choice in Mao's Mass Send-Down Movement 
Abstract:
 We use survey data on twins in urban China, among whom many experienced
 the consequences of the forced mass rustication movement of the Cultural
 Revolution, to identify the roles of altruism, favoritism, and guilt in
 affecting family behavior. We exploit the fact that many families were
 forced to select one of their adolescent children to be sent down. We show
 the conditions under which guilt, favoritism, and altruism can be
 identified using such data. We find that parents behaved altruistically,
 showed favoritism, but also exhibited guilt: the child experiencing more
 rustication years received higher parental transfers despite having higher
 earnings. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: How Well Does the U.S. Social Insurance System Provide Social Insurance? 
Abstract:
 We analyze the insurance provided by the U.S. social security and income
 tax system within a model in which agents receive idiosyncratic, wage rate
 shocks that are privately observed. We consider two reforms: a piecemeal
 reform that optimally chooses the social security benefit function and a
 radical reform that eliminates the entire social insurance system and
 replaces it with an optimal tax on lifetime earnings. The radical reform
 outperforms the piecemeal reform and achieves nearly all of the maximum
 possible welfare gain when wages differ permanently over the lifetime.
 When wage shocks match properties in U.S. data, the piecemeal reform
 outperforms the radical reform. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Cyclicality, Mortality, and the Value of Time: The Case of Coffee Price Fluctuations and Child Survival in Colombia 
Abstract:
 Recent studies demonstrate procyclical mortality in wealthy countries, but
 there are reasons to expect a countercyclical relationship in developing
 nations. We investigate how child survival in Colombia responds to
 fluctuations in world arabica coffee prices and document starkly
 procyclical child deaths. In studying this result's behavioral
 underpinnings, we highlight that (1) the leading determinants of child
 health are inexpensive but require considerable time, and (2) as the value
 of time declines with falling coffee prices, so does the relative price of
 health. We find a variety of direct evidence consistent with the primacy
 of time in child health production. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Why Do the Elderly Save? The Role of Medical Expenses 
Abstract:
 This paper constructs a model of saving for retired single people that
 includes heterogeneity in medical expenses and life expectancies, and
 bequest motives. We estimate the model using Assets and Health Dynamics of
 the Oldest Old data and the method of simulated moments. Out-of-pocket
 medical expenses rise quickly with age and permanent income. The risk of
 living long and requiring expensive medical care is a key driver of saving
 for many higher-income elderly. Social insurance programs such as Medicaid
 rationalize the low asset holdings of the poorest but also benefit the
 rich by insuring them against high medical expenses at the ends of their
 lives. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
