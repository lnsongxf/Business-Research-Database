Title: Club Goods and Group Identity: Evidence from Islamic Resurgence during the Indonesian Financial Crisis 
Abstract:
 This paper tests a model in which group identity in the form of religious
 intensity functions as ex post insurance. I exploit relative price shocks
 induced by the Indonesian financial crisis to demonstrate a causal
 relationship between economic distress and religious intensity (Koran
 study and Islamic school attendance) that is weaker for other forms of
 group identity. Consistent with ex post insurance, credit availability
 reduces the effect of economic distress on religious intensity, religious
 intensity alleviates credit constraints, and religious institutions smooth
 consumption shocks across households and within households, particularly
 for those who were less religious before the crisis. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Order in Product Customization Decisions: Evidence from Field Experiments 
Abstract:
 Differentiated product models are predicated on the belief that a
 product's utility can be derived from the summation of utilities for its
 individual attributes. In one framed field experiment and two natural
 field experiments, we test this assumption by experimentally manipulating
 the order of attribute presentation in the product customization process
 of custom-made suits and automobiles. We find that order affects the
 design of a suit that people configure and the design and price of a car
 that people purchase by influencing the likelihood that they will accept
 the default option suggested by the firm. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Press Coverage and Political Accountability 
Abstract:
 We estimate the impact of press coverage on citizen knowledge,
 politicians' actions, and policy. We find that voters living in areas
 where, for exogenous reasons, the press covers their U.S. House
 representative less are less likely to recall their representative's name
 and less able to describe and rate him or her. Congressmen who are less
 covered by the local press work less for their constituencies: they are
 less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings, to serve on
 constituency-oriented committees (perhaps), and to vote against the party
 line. Finally, federal spending is lower in areas with exogenously lower
 press coverage of congressmen. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Bargaining and Majority Rules: A Collective Search Perspective 
Abstract:
 We study collective search processes in which members of a committee
 decide whether to accept the current proposal or continue searching. The
 acceptance decision is made according to majority rule. We study which
 members have more impact on the decision, as well as the degree of
 randomness of the decision. When proposals vary along a single dimension,
 the acceptance set is small, and at most two members determine the outcome
 whatever the majority rule. When proposals vary along many dimensions, the
 acceptance set is large except under unanimity and all members affect the
 distribution of decisions. Various implications are drawn. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Can Pay Regulation Kill? Panel Data Evidence on the Effect of Labor Markets on Hospital Performance 
Abstract:
 In many sectors, pay is regulated to be equal across heterogeneous
 geographical labor markets. When the competitive outside wage is higher
 than the regulated wage, there are likely to be falls in quality. We
 exploit panel data from the population of English hospitals in which
 regulated pay for nurses is essentially flat across the country. Higher
 outside wages significantly worsen hospital quality as measured by
 hospital deaths for emergency heart attacks. A 10 percent increase in the
 outside wage is associated with a 7 percent increase in death rates.
 Furthermore, the regulation increases aggregate death rates in the public
 health care system. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
