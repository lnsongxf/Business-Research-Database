Title: Housing Externalities 
Abstract:
 Using data compiled from concentrated residential urban revitalization
 programs implemented in Richmond, Virginia, between 1999 and 2004, we
 study residential externalities. We estimate that housing externalities
 decrease by half approximately every 1,000 feet. On average, land prices
 in neighborhoods targeted for revitalization rose by 2-5 percent at an
 annual rate above those in a control neighborhood. These increases
 translate into land value gains of between $2 and $6 per dollar invested
 in the program over a 6-year period. We provide a simple theory that helps
 us estimate and interpret these effects in terms of the parameters of the
 model. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Competition and the Structure of Vertical Relationships in Capital Markets 
Abstract:
 We show that information flows between investment banks and their clients
 affect relationships and that shocks to these flows affect corporate
 investment. Firms avoid sharing investment banks in their industry, but
 only when they engage in product market competition. This suggests that
 concerns about disclosure of confidential information to strategic rivals
 determine firms' investment bank choices. Using exogenous shocks to
 information flows arising from bank mergers, we show that the desire to
 avoid sharing banks has a substantial effect on investment. These
 information effects help us understand how the investment banking industry
 is structured, how banks compete, and how prices are set. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Innovation, Firm Dynamics, and International Trade 
Abstract:
 We present a general equilibrium model of the response of firms' decisions
 to operate, innovate, and engage in international trade to a change in the
 marginal cost of international trade. We find that, although a change in
 trade costs can have a substantial impact on heterogeneous firms' exit,
 export, and process innovation decisions, the impact of changes in these
 decisions on welfare is largely offset by the response of product
 innovation. Our results suggest that microeconomic evidence on firms'
 responses to changes in international trade costs may not be informative
 about the implications of changes in these trade costs for aggregate
 welfare. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Identifying Agglomeration Spillovers: Evidence from Winners and Losers of Large Plant Openings 
Abstract:
 We quantify agglomeration spillovers by comparing changes in total factor
 productivity (TFP) among incumbent plants in "winning" counties that
 attracted a large manufacturing plant and "losing" counties that were the
 new plant's runner-up choice. Winning and losing counties have similar
 trends in TFP prior to the new plant opening. Five years after the
 opening, incumbent plants' TFP is 12 percent higher in winning counties.
 This productivity spillover is larger for plants sharing similar labor and
 technology pools with the new plant. Consistent with spatial equilibrium
 models, labor costs increase in winning counties, indicating that profits
 ultimately increase less than productivity. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Does Professor Quality Matter? Evidence from Random Assignment of Students to Professors 
Abstract:
 In primary and secondary education, measures of teacher quality are often
 based on contemporaneous student performance on standardized achievement
 tests. In the postsecondary environment, scores on student evaluations of
 professors are typically used to measure teaching quality. We possess
 unique data that allow us to measure relative student performance in
 mandatory follow-on classes. We compare metrics that capture these three
 different notions of instructional quality and present evidence that
 professors who excel at promoting contemporaneous student achievement
 teach in ways that improve their student evaluations but harm the
 follow-on achievement of their students in more advanced classes. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.
