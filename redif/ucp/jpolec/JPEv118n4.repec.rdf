Title: Explaining the Favorite-Long Shot Bias: Is it Risk-Love or Misperceptions? 
Abstract:
 The favorite-long shot bias describes the long-standing empirical
 regularity that betting odds provide biased estimates of the probability
 of a horse winning: long shots are overbet whereas favorites are underbet.
 Neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers
 who overbet long shots because of risk-love. The competing behavioral
 explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities. We
 provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these
 competing theories by assessing whether the models that explain gamblers'
 choices in one part of their choice set (betting to win) can also
 rationalize decisions over a wider choice set, including compound bets in
 the exacta, quinella, or trifecta pools. Using a new, large-scale data set
 ideally suited to implement these tests, we find evidence in favor of the
 view that misperceptions of probability drive the favorite-long shot bias,
 as suggested by prospect theory. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Matching and Inequality in the World Economy 
Abstract:
 This paper develops tools and techniques to analyze the determinants of
 factor allocation and factor prices in economies with a large number of
 goods and factors. The main results of our paper characterize sufficient
 conditions for robust monotone comparative statics predictions in a
 Roy-like assignment model. These general results are then used to generate
 new insights about the consequences of globalization. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Quality Matters: The Expulsion of Professors and the Consequences for PhD Student Outcomes in Nazi Germany 
Abstract:
 I investigate the effect of faculty quality on PhD student outcomes.To
 address the endogeneity of faculty quality I use exogenous
 variationprovided by the expulsion of mathematics professors in Nazi
 Germany. Faculty quality is a very important determinant of short- and
 long-run PhD student outcomes. A one-standard-deviation increase in
 faculty quality increases the probability of publishing the dissertation
 ina top journal by 13 percentage points, the probability of becoming a full
 professor by 10 percentage points, the probability of having positive
 lifetime citations by 16 percentage points, and the number of lifetime
 citations by 6.3. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: Assessing Risky Social Situations 
Abstract:
 This paper reexamines the welfare economics of risk. It singles out a
 class of criteria, the "expected equally distributed equivalent," as the
 unique class that avoids serious drawbacks of existing approaches. Such
 criteria behave like ex post criteria when the final statistical
 distribution of well-being is known ex ante and like ex ante criteria when
 risk generates no inequality. The paper also provides a new result on the
 tension between inequality aversion and respect of individual ex ante
 preferences, in the vein of Harsanyi's aggregation theorem. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

Title: The Macroeconomic Implications of Rising Wage Inequality in the United States 
Abstract:
 In recent decades, American workers have faced a rising college premium, a
 narrowing gender gap, and increasing wage volatility. This paper explores
 the quantitative and welfare implications of these changes. The framework
 is an incomplete-markets life cycle model in which individuals choose
 education, intrafamily time allocation, and savings. Given the observed
 history of the U.S. wage structure, the model replicates key trends in
 cross-sectional inequality in hours worked, earnings, and consumption.
 Recent cohorts enjoy welfare gains,on average, as higher relative wages
 for college graduates and for women translate into higher educational
 attainment and a more even division of labor within the household. (c) 2010 by The University of Chicago. Allrights reserved.
