Title: Self-Control at Work
Abstract: Self-control problems change the logic of agency theory by partly aligning the interests of the firm and worker: both now value contracts that elicit future effort. Findings from a year-long field experiment with full-time data entry workers support this idea. First, workers increase output by voluntarily choosing dominated contracts (which penalize low output but give no additional rewards for high output). Second, effort increases closer to (randomly assigned) paydays. Third, the contract and payday effects are strongly correlated within workers, and this correlation grows with experience. We suggest that workplace features such as high-powered incentives or effort monitoring may provide self-control benefits.

Title: An Endowment Effect for Risk: Experimental Tests of Stochastic Reference Points
Abstract: Recent models of reference-dependent preferences indicate that expectations may play a prominent role in the presence of behavioral anomalies. A subset of such expectations-based models predicts an "endowment effect for risk": that risk attitudes differ when reference points change from certain to stochastic. In two purposefully simple risk preference experiments, eliminating often-discussed confounds, I demonstrate both between and within subjects such an endowment effect for risk. These results provide needed separation between expectations-based reference-dependent models, allow for evaluation of recent theoretical extensions, and may help to close a long-standing debate in decision science on inconsistency between utility elicitation methodologies.

Title: A Measure of Rationality and Welfare
Abstract: Evidence showing that individual behavior often deviates from the classical principle of preference maximization has raised at least two important questions: (1) How serious are the deviations? (2) What is the best way to analyze choice behavior in order to extract information for the purpose of welfare analysis? This paper addresses these questions by proposing a new way to identify the preference relation that is closest, in terms of welfare loss, to the revealed choice.

Title: Those Who Know Most: Insider Trading in Eighteenth-Century Amsterdam
Abstract: This paper studies how private information is incorporated into prices, using a unique setting from the eighteenth century that is closer to stylized models of price discovery than modern-day markets. Specifically, the paper looks at English securities traded in both London and Amsterdam. Private information reached Amsterdam through sailing boats that sailed only twice a week and in adverse weather could not sail at all. Results are consistent with a Kyle model in which informed agents trade strategically. Most importantly, the speed of information revelation in Amsterdam depended on the expected time until the private signal would become public.

Title: Production versus Revenue Efficiency with Limited Tax Capacity: Theory and Evidence from Pakistan
Abstract: To fight evasion, many developing countries use production-inefficient tax policies. This includes minimum tax schemes whereby firms are taxed on either profits or turnover, depending on which tax liability is larger. Such schemes create nonstandard kink points, which allow for eliciting evasion responses to switches between profit and turnover taxes using a bunching approach. Using administrative data on corporations in Pakistan, we estimate that turnover taxes reduce evasion by up to 60-70 percent of corporate income. Incorporating this in a calibrated optimal tax model, we find that switching from profit to turnover taxation increases revenue by 74 percent without reducing aggregate profits.

Title: Micro- and Macroeconomic Implications of Heterogeneity in the
                    Production of Human Capital
Abstract: We derive a tractable nonlinear earnings function that we estimate separately
                    individual by individual using NLSY79 data. We obtain three ability measures, a
                    rate of skill depreciation, a time discount rate, and a population-wide estimate
                    of the human capital rental rate. We utilize these parameters to verify a number
                    of heretofore untested theorems based on the life cycle model. We show how these
                    human capital production function parameters relate to cognitive ability,
                    personality traits, and family background. Finally, we show that accounting for
                    individual-specific heterogeneity dramatically reduces estimates of
                    population-wide persistence of permanent and transitory shocks by over 50
                    percent.
