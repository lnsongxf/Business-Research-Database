Title:   A Disaggregated Analysis of the Allocation of Time within the Household. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 223-49
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  In this paper the authors estimate a model of the allocation of time
 within the household using data that allows them to d istinguish between a
 large number of time uses. The model is explicitly derived within a
 utility maximization framework and can be estimated by relatively simpl e
 two-step estimation procedures. The model providesa natural framework to
 test implications of the more restrictive models of Reuben Gronau_(1977,
 1980) and John Graham and Carole Green_(1984).  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Impact of Right-to-Work Laws on Union Organizing. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 250-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Unlike most previous work, this paper examines the effect of right-
 to-work laws on flows into unionism through organizing rather than onthe
 stock of unionism. Organizing offers a far more sensitive indicator of the
 situa tion of unionism and allows the use of both cross-sectional and
 time-series methods to explore the impact of the passage of a
 right-to-work law. The authors find that right-to-work laws have a sizable
 initial impact on organizing that decay s over time. The effect holds up
 even when one uses fixed weights and causality tests.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Of a Controversial Passage in Hume. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 274-89
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  David Hume's (1955 ) analysis of how a change in the quantity of money
 can have a temporary effect on real income has been variously interpreted
 and misinterpreted for over two hundred years. A possible reason for some
 misinterpretation is Hume's archaic use of the term "labor." With the
 correct interpretation, which is consistent with Hume's other theories and
 in particular his theory ofthe interest rate, the reason for the temporary
 effect on real income is that prices lag behind money wages, and a rise in
 real wages leads to an increased supply of effort.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Causes of U.S. Farm Commodity Programs. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 290-310
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper i s an attempt to explain variations by commodity in producer
 protection afforded by farm price support programs since the1930s.
 Particularly emphasized are theideas that these programs are essentially
 income redistributional measures and that, given political forces, the
 programs are attempts to redistribute efficiently. Variables associated
 with the cost to producers of generating political pressure and the social
 cost (deadweight losses)of redistribution are both found to be empirically
 important.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Specification and Estimation of Nonseparable Two-Stage Technologies: The Leontief CES and the Cobb-Douglas CES. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 311-33
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A two-stage technology is a sequential production process that first uses
 pri mary inputs to produce intermediate inputs and then uses
 theintermediate inputs to produce final output. In this paper the authors
 show that two-stage technologies provide a general procedure for combining
 production functions or cost functions to obtain new specifications
 suitable for empirical production analysis. They investigate two new cost
 functions for which the input demand systemssatisfy global regularity
 conditions in a wide range of nondegenerate cases. Using six data sets,
 the authors estimate thesetwo input demand systems, both with and without
 imposing global regularity conditions, and find that one of them performs
 well.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Capital Accumulation and Annuities in an Adverse Selection Economy. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 334-54
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper suggests that adverse selection problems in competitive
 annuity markets can generate quantity-constrained equilibria in which some
 agents, whose length of lifetime is uncertain, find it advantageous to
 accumulate capital privately. This occurs despite the higher rates of
 return on annuities. The welfare properties of these allocations are
 analyzed. It is shown that the level of capital accumulation is excessive
 in a Paretian sense. Policies that eliminate this inefficiency are
 discussed.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Returns to Acquirers and Competition in the Acquisition Market: The Case of Banking. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 355-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  In this paper the authors examine the effect of competition in the market
 for bank acquisitions on the acquirers' stock returns. Bank acquisitions
 are examined because federal and state regulations greatly facilitate the
 identification of potential bidders and alter native targets in an
 acquisition. They find that the gain to acquirers is positively related to
 the number of alternative target firms available and negatively related to
 the number of other potential bidders. These results provide some insights
 into the sources of gains from bank acquisitions.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Arbitrage and Martingales with Taxation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 371-93
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper extends the martingale analysis of no arbitrage pricing to
 worlds with taxation. The absence of arbitrage is shown to imply the
 existence of different shadow prices for income streams that are subject
 to differing tax treatments. For example , no arbitrage implies the
 existence of different martingale measures for capita l gains and for
 ordinary income when they are differentially taxed, andfor item s such as
 depreciation expenses that influence only after- tax cash flows. The
 analysis is applied to several topics in finance including the debt/equity
 decision, tax options, and the taxation of dividends and pensions.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Knight on Risk and Uncertainty. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 394-406
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  It is argued that the received interpretation of Frank Knight's_(1921)
 classic risk-uncertainty distinction-as concerning whether or not agents
 have subjective probabilities-constitutes a misreading of Knight. On the
 contrary, Knight shared the modern view that agents can be assumed always
 to act as if they have subjective probabilities. The authors document
 their contention that by uncert ainty Knight instead meant situations in
 which insurance markets collapse because of moral hazard or adverse
 selection. Knight's discussion of market failure, a lthough always
 informal and in placesinaccurate, was in many respects a remarka ble
 anticipation of the modern literature.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Government Purchases and Real Interest Rates. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 407-19
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the dynamic impact of government purchases in a
 simple general equilibrium model with both durable and nondurable consumer
 goods as well as productive capital. The model generates perhaps
 surprising results. In particular, increases in government purchases are
 shown to cause reductions in real interest rates. The model thus provides
 a possible explanation for the observed behavior of real interest rates
 around wars.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Financing Public Goods. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 420-37
Issue: 2
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Public goods can be financed by direct taxation or a subsidy to private
 spending. This paper examines the relative efficiency and distributional
 consequences of the two methods. Efficiency is shown to depend on the
 price elasticity of private spending and the trade- off between public and
 private spending. When this trade-off is dollar for dollar, however, a
 subsidy is always more efficient than direct taxation. The gains from a
 subsidy are larger for a mixed good than for a pure public good. Looking a
 t distributional effects, the author shows when richer taxpayers may
 prefer a tax credit to deductibility, even though they face lower prices
 with deductibility, and also shows when richer taxpayers prefer direct
 taxation to either type of subsidy.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.
