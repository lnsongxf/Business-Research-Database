Title:   A Time-Series Analysis of Self-employment in the United State. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 445-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In the early 1970s the proportion of the nonagricultural labor force
 self-employed in the United States ceased its downward trend and has been
 rising ever since. This study provides an analysis of the causes of this
 change. A general-equilibrium model of self- employment and wage
 employment is analyzed, and aggregate U.S. time- series data are used to
 test predictions derived from the model. The empirical analysis indicates
 that changes in technology, industrial structure, tax rates, and
 social-security retirement benefits have contributed to the reversal of
 the previous downward trend, which had persisted for over a century.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Should Social Security Benefits Be Means Tested? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 468-84
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Social-security retirement benefits distort the saving decisions of
 workers who are rational enough to save for their future. Since the
 implicit rate of return in an unfunded social-security program is less
 than the marginal product of capital, the resulting decline in saving
 causes a welfare loss. The present paper examines the conditions under
 which the welfare loss can be reduced by replacing the current universal
 social-security program with a means-tested program that pays benefits
 only to those individuals with little or no other retirement income or
 assets.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Bank Runs as an Equilibrium Phenomenon. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 485-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A standard demand-deposit contract in which individuals are entitled to
 their full deposit at any time provided the bank is solvent is analyzed in
 a context in which there are no exogenous events on which agents condition
 their behavior and a unique equilibrium involving a bank run with positive
 probability is shown to exist.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Will Developing Country Nutrition Improve with Income? A Case Study for Rural South India. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 492-507
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The World Bank and others maintain that the major mechanism for improving
 nutrition in poor communities is increases in income. Aggregate estimates
 of food expenditure are consistent with such a possibility, implying
 income/expenditure elasticities close to one. However, the high degree of
 aggregation at which such estimates are made means that the considerable
 increase in price per nutrient as income increases is ignored, and the
 nutrient elasticities are therefore overstated. Estimates for a rural
 south Indian sample indicate that this bias is considerable and that the
 true nutrient elasticities with respect to income may be close to zero.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Motives for Private Income Transfers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 508-46
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Private income transfers are becoming increasingly recognized as a key
 aspect of the U.S. economy. The majority of private income transfers occur
 inter vivos (i.e., between living persons), but very little is known about
 this type of transfer behavior. This paper tests alternative hypotheses
 concerning motivation for inter vivos transfers. Two motives are
 considered: altruism and exchange. Evidence presented here casts doubt on
 the altruistic model of transfer behavior. Observed patterns for inter
 vivos transfers are more consistent with exchange-related motives. This
 finding has important implications for the effects of public transfer
 programs on the distribution of economic well-being.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Relative Price Variability and Inflation: A Disaggregated Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 547-66
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Relative price variability has been studied at the cross-sectional
 (intermarket) level. This paper addresses the equally important phenomenon
 of intramarket variability: the dispersion of commodity price movements
 around the industry average. Using quarterly price data for eighty
 disaggregated commodity groups in the United Kingdom from 1974 to 1984,
 the paper investigates the determinants of intramarket price variability
 and replicates some previous cross-sectional tests for the United Kingdom.
 Intramarket price variability is found to be positively related to
 inflation. Intramarket variability is found to be positively related to
 the average (market) rate of price change.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Development of the New Monetary Economics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 567-90
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper looks into the history of economic thought to examine the
 forerunners of the "new monetary economics." This approach emphasizes the
 role of regulations on private financial intermediation in determining the
 particular institutional arrangements that contemporary monetary theory
 treats as data. The "new view" investigates the possibility that under
 laissez-faire the unit of account and means of payment, traditionally
 bundled together in the item called "money," may become separated. The
 earlier writers who share this perspective have been overlooked by
 historians of economic thought as well as by recent contributors to the
 new monetary economics. Many of the insights of these theorists are
 relevant to modern monetary theory.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consensus and Uncertainty in Economic Prediction. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 591-621
Issue: 3
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors define "consensus" as the degree of agreement among point
 predictions aimed at the same target by different individuals and "
 "uncertainty" as the diffuseness of the corresponding probability
 distributions. This distinction is made operational with the aid of the
 NBERAASA survey data on matched point and probabilistic forecasts of
 inflation and the rate of change in gross national product. The means of
 the two sets of forecasts agree closely. Standard deviations of point
 forecasts tend to understate uncertainty as measured by standard
 deviations of the predictive probability distributions. However, these
 measures of consensus and uncertainty are on the whole positively
 correlated.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.
