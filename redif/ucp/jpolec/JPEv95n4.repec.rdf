Title:   Tests of Alternative Theories of Firm Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 657-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This study examines the relationships among firm growth, firm size, and
 firm age for a sample of manufacturing firms between 1976 and 1982. Firm
 growth is found to decrease with firm age and firm size. These findings
 are robust to alternative assumptions concerning the effects of sample
 censoring and the functional form of the growth relationship. The inverse
 growth-age relationship is consistent with a theory of firm learning
 proposed by Boyan Jovanovic while the inverse growth-size relationship is
 inconsistent with a number of theories that assume or imply Gibrat's law.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Welfare Cost of Factor Taxation in a Perfect-Foresight Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 675-709
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the marginal efficiency cost of various factor taxes
 in a dynamic general-equilibrium model. The au thor solves for the excess
 burden of anticipated and unanticipated, t emporary and permanent, tax
 policies. Using a range of estimates for taste and technology parameters,
 he finds excess burdens larger than those indicated by previous studies
 that use static models. These exc ess burdens are sensitive to parameter
 values and timing. However, th e rankings of alternative tax policies turn
 out to be insensitive to structural parameter values.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effect of Federal Tax Deductibility on State and Local Taxes and Spending. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 710-36
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the effect of federal deductibility of state and
 local taxes on the fiscal behavior of state and local governments. The
 primary finding is that deductibil ity affects the way that state and
 local governments finance their sp ending as well as the overall level of
 spending. More specifically, i n states in which federal deductibility
 implies a relatively low cost of using deductible personal taxes
 (including income, sales, and pro perty taxes), there is greater reliance
 on those taxes and less relia nce on business taxes and other revenue
 sources. The effect of deduct ibility on the state and local financial mix
 implies that deductibili ty has a much lower cost to the federal
 government than has previousl y been assumed.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Additive General Error Models for Production, Cost, and Derived Demand or Share Systems. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 737-57
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Many empirical studies of production specify a deterministic model of the
 firm, derive the implied behavioral equat ions (input demand or share
 system), and then "embed this system in a stochastic framework" by tacking
 on linear error terms. In contras t, this paper proposes general error
 models (GEMs) in which the error specification is an integral part of the
 optimization model. These m odels are the statistical embodiment of
 Stigler's view that apparent observed inefficiencies reflect the
 investigator's ignorance of the t rue optimization problems. Additive GEMs
 are proposed and interpreted Specification tests indicate that a translog
 additive GEM is superi or to the standard translog specification.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Walras's Theories of Tatonnement. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 758-74
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  It is shown that Leon Walras developed two separate theories of
 tatonnement. One is a disequilibrium-production model. The other is a
 pledges model, in which transactions and production occur only at the
 equilibrium set of prices. These models are explained, and the manner in
 which they appear in the vari ous editions of Walras's Elements is used to
 account for the developm ent of conflicting interpretations of his
 writings on tatonnement. It is shown that the disequilibrium-production
 model is more representa tive of Walras's work than the pledges model and
 that the latter is i ncompatible with the theories of particular aspects
 of economic behav ior on which the Elements depends for its verisimilitude
 and explanat ory power.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Impact of Direct Taxes on the Cost of Living. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 775-96
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors define a cost-of-living index including direct
 taxes. They show its relationship to the traditional index and demonstrate
 how nonconsumption costs are properly treated. They t hen define a
 fixed-weight approximation, a tax and price index (TPI). Using federal,
 state, local, and social security tax rates for 1967- 85, the authors
 construct annual TPI series based on household data. They find that
 inclusion of direct taxes has sizable impacts on the e stimated rate of
 inflation. Partitioning their household sample, they find that recognition
 of taxes significantly alters inflation rate d ifferentials estimated
 using consumption prices alone.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Dissipation of Profits by Brand Name Investment and Entry when Price Guarantees Quality. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 797-809
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Two previous models of the dissipation of profits generated by the use of
 quality-guaranteeing prices assumed that pro fits were dissipated through
 investment in brand-name capital and ent ry. The model of this paper
 allows both possibilities. It is shown th at both types of dissipation
 will, in general, occur and that brand-n ame investment will dissipate a
 greater share of profits as the elast icity of consumer response to
 brand-name investment grows larger.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Ideals versus Dollars: Donors, Charity Managers, and Government Grants. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 810-23
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper demonstrates how changes in untied, lump-sum government grants
 or income from unrestricted endowments will affect the behavior of
 charities operated by managers with s trong philosophical or professional
 commitments. An increase in such funds will reduce the charity's
 accountability to private donors and lower its fund-raising activities.
 The grant will not be spent entire ly on raising the quantity of output.
 Instead, it will permit the cha rity manager to reduce his or her
 dependence on the costly solicitati on of donors who do not completely
 share the manager's preferences.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Abstract:
  This paper constructs a two-period, two-sector model in which there are

 labor supply, sectoral em ployment, and duration of unemployment in
 response to these shocks. E quilibrium allocations are shown to be easy to
 characterize and compa rative statistics results are provided.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Trade, Capital Mobility, and Tax Competition. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 835-56
Issue: 4
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper examines a system of governments that finance public
 expenditures with taxes on mobile capital. Unlike previous research on
 "tax competition," expli cit consideration is given to the
 general-equilibrium determination o f the prices at which goods are traded
 between regions. The analysis identifies inefficiencies in government
 behavior that are not apparen t in models in which the terms of trade are
 exogenously given. Capita l taxation is shown to create an inefficient
 distribution of public-g ood outputs across regions, accompanied by an
 inefficient pattern of trade. A model is presented in which the chosen
 levels of public-good outputs differ across regions containing identical
 residents and pro duction possibilities.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.
