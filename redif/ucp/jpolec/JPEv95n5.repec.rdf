Title:   Futures Markets: A Consequences of Risk Aversion or Transactions Costs? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1000-1023
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  A two-period model of an industry of risk-neutral processors who have
 nonlinear production costs and who face transact ions costs in the spot
 and futures markets is put forth as a countere xample to the models of
 commodity markets in which processors' risk a version plays the major
 role. The model's equilibrium exhibits the sa lient endogenous features of
 actual commodity markets, namely, that t he futures price is below the
 current spot price, that processors hol d inventories despite this
 opportunity cost, that those holding inven tories are short in futures,
 and that processors as a group hold an u nbalanced, usually net short,
 position in the futures market.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Equilibrium Model of Exchange Rate Determination and Asset Pricing with Nontraded Goods and Imperfect Information. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1024-40
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a two-country model with maximizing households,
 stochastic production, stochastic money growth, and perfect capital
 mobility. Because of the presence of nontraded goods, households in
 different countries consume different goods. Analytic solutions are
 presented for the nominal exchange rate, the real exchange rate, nominal
 interest rates, and real interest rates. It is shown that the model is
 compatible with some important features of the real-world behavior of
 exchange rates. When households are imperfectly informed about the
 distribution of money growth, the exchange rate exhibits patterns of
 overshooting and is more volatile than the ratio of the money stocks.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Competition and the Number of Firms in a Market: Are Duopolies More Competitive than Atomistic Markets? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1041-61
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper uses a variant of the standard search model to examine market
 equilibrium and the co nsequences of an increase in the number of firms.
 If marginal search costs increase with the number of searches, then the
 demand curve fac ing any firm will be kinked, with the elasticity of
 demand with respe ct to price decreases being less than with respect to
 price increases ; prices may not change in response to changes in marginal
 costs. As the number of firms increases, the maximum price that is
 consistent w ith equilibrium increases to the monopoly price, but the
 minimum pric e decreases. On the other hand, if marginal search costs
 decrease wit h the number of searches, equilibrium, if it exists, is
 characterized by a price distribution.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Cointegration and Tests of Present Value Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1062-88
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Application of some advances in econometrics (in the theory of
 cointegrated vector autoregressive models) enables us to deal effectively
 with two problems in rational-expectations, present-valu e models:
 nonstationarity of time series and incomplete data on infor mation of
 market participants. With U.S. data, the authors find some relatively
 encouraging new results for the rational-expectations theo ry of the term
 structure and some puzzling results for the present-va lue model of stock
 prices.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Cold Houses in Warm Climates and Vice Versa: A Paradox of Rational Heating. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1089-97
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Houses in cold climates are kept warmer in winter than those in warm
 climates, des pite the greater cost of heating in colder climates. It is
 shown that this is not only consistent with, but also implied by,
 rationality. The contrary intuition is based on a confusion between
 average and ma rginal cost. The same analysis implies that it is rational
 to keep th e thermostat setting constant throughout the heating season
 rather th an changing it with changes in external temperature.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Testing between Competing Models of Sharecropping. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 893-920
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The "Marshallian" approach assumes a prohibitively hight cost of monitor
 ing the sharecropper's activities while the "monitoring" approach a rgues
 that landlords stipulate and effectively monitor sharecroppers'
 activities. The author presents new evidence using detailed data col
 lected from eight Indian villages. Most tenants own some land of thei r
 own; this provides a controlled environment in studying the impact of
 contractual arrangements. The differences in input and output inte nsities
 on owned minus sharecropped land of the same household are fo und to be
 sizable and significant, suggesting a rejection of the moni toring
 approach and supporting the notion of the "Marshallian produc tive
 inefficiency" of sharecropping.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Auctioning Incentive Contracts. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 921-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper draws a remarkably simple bridge between auction theory and
 incentive theory. It considers the auctioning of an indivisible project
 among several fi rms. The firms have private information about their
 future cost at th e bidding stage, and the selected firm ex post invests
 in cost reduct ion. The authors show that (1) the optimal auction can be
 implemented by a dominant strategy auction that uses information about
 both the first bid and the second bid; (2) the winner faces a (linear)
 incenti ve contract; (3) the fixed transfer to the winner decreases with
 his announced expected cost and increases with the second lowest announce
 d expected cost; and (4) the share of cost overruns borne by the winn er
 decreases with the winner's announced expected cost.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On Intertemporal Substitution and Aggregate Labor Supply. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 938-60
Issue: 5
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the author presents an econometric investigation of t he
 implications of the intertemporal substitution hypothesis for aggregate
 employment in the United States. The tests are based on a version of the
 hypothesis with time-separable preferences. On the basis of the evidence
 produced, the hypothesis is quite successful in explaining fluctuations in
 aggregate employment, although almost totally unsuccessful in accounting
 for fluctuations in employee hours. These findings suggest that the
 hypothesis might have an important role to play in macroeconomic modeling,
 although they contradict attempts to account for aggregate fluctuations
 solely in terms of continuous competitive equilibrium in labor markets.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Paths of Development in the Three-Factor, n-Good General Equilibrium Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 961-99
Issue: 5
Volume: 95

Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The three-factor, n-good model is displayed graphically and tested
 empirically. The three-dimensional endowment vectors and expansion paths
 are represented by points in an endowment triangle. Features of this
 endowment triangle determine relative factor returns, Rybczy nski and
 Stolper-Samuelson derivatives, output mixes, and the directi on of trade.
 The effects of mobile factors and nontraded goods are al so considered.
 Capital accumulation is shown to induce changes in out puts, trade, and
 the returns to factors that depend on the abundance of land relative to
 labor. Weak evidence for this 3 A n model is foun d in a 1978 U.N. data
