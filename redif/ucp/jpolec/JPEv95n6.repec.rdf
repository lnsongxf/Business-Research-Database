Title:   Informational Externalities and Welfare-Reducing Speculation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1123-45
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Introducing more speculators into the market for a given commodity leads
 to improved risk sharing but can also change the informational content of
 prices. This inflicts an externality on those traders already in the
 market, whose ability to make inferences based on current prices will be
 aff ected. In some cases, the externality is negative: the entry of new s
 peculators lowers the informativeness of the price to existing trader s.
 The net result can be one of price destabilization and welfare red uction.
 This is true even when all agents are rational, risk-averse c ompetitors
 who make the best possible use of their available informat ion.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Labor Rent Sharing and Regulation: Evidence from the Trucking Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1146-78
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Labor is likely to be an important claimant to firms' rents, particularly
 in a regulated environment. This study analyzes wage responses to trucking
 deregulation to test labor rent-sharing hypotheses. The results indicate
 substantial declines in union wages as a consequence of reduced regulatory
 rents. Union premia over nonunion wages fell from 50 percent to less than
 30 percent, implying aggregate annual losses of $950 million to $1.6
 billion. Rent spillovers to nonunion drivers and truck drivers outside the
 regulated trucking industry appear insignificant. The results suggest that
 union workers captured more than two-thirds of total industry rents and
 provide strong support for union rent-sharing hypotheses.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Information, Multiprice Search, and Cost-of-Living Index Theory. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1179-95
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper derives the cost-of-living index of an individual who faces
 imperfect and costly information about prices. Traditional cost-of-living
 in dexes assume that the consumer passively accepts prices as given. The
 authors derive a multiprice search model in which the consumer choos es
 the search strategy that minimizes the expected cost of buying a g iven
 level of utility. In contrast to existing search models, the mod el allows
 the consumer to change the allocation of expenditures among goods as
 information about prices changes and enables them to constr uct a
 cost-of-living index for an agent who searches across distribut ions of
 offer prices. Unlike traditional cost-of-living measures that ignore
 search behavior, the searcher's cost-of-living index depends on search
 costs.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Financial Intermediation, Business Failures, and Real Business Cycles. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1196-1216
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In this paper, a general-equilibrium business- cycle model is construct
 ed that, when subjected to real disturbances, mimics observed qualita tive
 comovements among real output, money, business failures, risk pr emia,
 intermediary loans, and prices. In contrast, monetary disturban ces
 generate cycles that have several inconsistencies with empirical evidence,
 thus providing support for real business-cycle theory at th e expense of
 monetary theories of the business cycle. Financial inter mediation arises
 endogenously in the model and intermediation matters for business-cycle
 behavior. A credit supply mechanism acts in tande m with an intertemporal
 substitution effect in propagating stochastic disturbances.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Collusive Bidder Behavior at Single-Object Second-Price and English Auctions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1217-39
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Models of collusive bidder behavior at single-object second-price and
 English auctions are provided. The ind ependent private values model is
 generalized to permit the formulatio n of coalitions and a strategic
 response by the auctioneer. Cooperati ve strategies are found to be
 dominant in these models; coalitions of any size are viable, and the
 payoff to each member increases with th e size of the coalition. In
 addition, the collusive strategies of the coalition represent a
 noncooperative equilibrium. The optimal respon se of the auctioneer is to
 establish a reserve price that is a functi on of the coalition's size.
 These and other features of the model are found to be consistent with the
 essential features of actual behavio r.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Measuring Business Cycle Time. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1240-61
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The business cycle analysis of Arthur F. Burns and Wesley C. Mitchell and
 the National Bureau of Economic Research presumed that aggregate economic
 variables evolve on a time scale defined by business cycle turning points
 rather than by months or quarters. Do macroeconomic variables appear to
 evolve on an economic rather than a calendar time scale? Evidence
 presented here suggests that they do. However, the estimated economic time
 scales are only weakly related to business cycle time scales, providing
 evidence against the view underlying traditional business cycle analysis.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Working Hours and Hedonic Wages in the Market Equilibrium. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1262-77
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In the conventional model of labor supply, working hours are implicitly
 assumed to be divisible goods, which is an obviously unrealistic
 assumption. The purpose of this paper is to analyze working hours as
 indivisible goods. When working hours are indivisible, labors are
 differentiated in the market by their length, and wages will be a function
 of working hours. The main conclusions are that (1) in the market
 equilibrium, the elasticity of the hedo nic wage curve with respect to
 hourly wage rates must be positive or less than A1 and (2) generally data
 will reveal neither demand nor su pply structures.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Intraindustry Trade: 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1278-91
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of
 intraindustry trade. The authors demonstrat that two-way trade flows occur
 where conditions are favorable to international specialization consistent
 with the Stigler-Williamson analysis of the division of labor. The results
 are inconsistent wit h the prevailing product differentiation-cum-scale
 economies model of intraindustry trade. In addition, the authors show that
 intraindustr y trade has a significant impact on protectionist pressures.
 Exports of closely related products have the effect of mitigating the
 tariff- raising effects that imports would otherwise exert.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Returns to Individual Traders of Futures: Aggregate Results. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1292-1306
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  By means of a data set previously unavailable for academic research,
 actual trading histories of individual futures traders are examined. With
 this more detailed data, the author is able to (1) test the risk/return
 hypothesis directly; (2) include a much larger segment of the market than
 before; and (3) use actual instead of hypothetical t rading strategies. It
 is shown that the commercial (hedging) traders are most profitable, while
 noncommercial (speculative) traders earn n egative or zero profits.
 Because speculators are not receiving reward s for the risks they
 willingly absorb, the theory of normal backwarda tion and its extension
 can be rejected.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Abstract:
  This paper shows that allowing wealthy individuals to influence the
 outcome of their trials through the purchase of legal services can be
 consistent with the optimal penalty literature. Using this analysis, the
 author reviews some of the advantages and disadvantages of varying the
 length of jail terms versus varying the probability of conviction.
 Finally, implications for the bail, prosecutorial, and plea bargaining
 systems are examined.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Free Access versus Private Property in a Resource: Income Distributions Compared. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1317-25
Issue: 6
Volume: 95
Year: 1987
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Distributions of income are compared under the alternative regimes of
 free access to, and private property in, a resource. It is shown that, in
 several analytically distinct cases, all those deprived of free access on
 conversion of a resource to private property can be better off, even
 though no compensating transfers are made. This resu lt can hold even if
 the granting of private property rights also conf ers monopoly or
 monopsony power.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.

  The traditional model for assessing the effects of treble damage pena
 lties on price fixing is reexamined and shown to yield surprising res
 ults. Unless the probability of detection is extremely sensitive to the
 price charged, increasing the damage multiple will affect neither market
 efficiency nor expected distribution, and will raise the mark et price.  Copyright 1987 by University of Chicago Press.
