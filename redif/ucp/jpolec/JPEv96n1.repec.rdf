Title:   Bilateral Tradings as an Efficient Auction over Time. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 100-115
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  A market composed of pairwise trading under incomplete information is
 modeled in order to analyze how resources are allocated among competing
 uses when information about trade gains is incomplete. Contrary to the
 results from studying a single such trade, sufficient homogeneity across
 potential trades guarantees that efficiency obtains. This is analogous to
 simple first-price auctions with homogeneous bidders, where bidders have a
 common bid function and, as a result, the high bidder also places the
 highest value on the auctioned object. With enough symmetry, the
 decentralized bilateral trades in the present model occur as if they were
 made in a first-price auction that occurs through time.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Capital Asset Pricing Model with Time-Varying Covariances. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 116-31
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The capital asset pricing model provides a theoretical structure for the
 pricing of assets with uncertain returns. The premium to induc e
 risk-averse investors to bear risk is proportional to the nondivers
 ifiable risk, which is measured by the covariance of the asset return with
 the market portfolio return. In this paper, a multivariate, gen
 eralized-autoregressive, conditional, heteroscedastic process is esti
 mated for returns to bills, bonds, and stocks where the expected retu rn
 is proportional to the conditional covariance of each return with that of
 a fully diversified or market portfolio. It is found that the conditional
 covariances are quite variable over time and are a signi ficant
 determinant of the time-varying risk premia. The implied betas are also
 time varying and forecastable.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Industrial Organization of Congress; or, Why Legislatures, Like Firms, Are Not Organized as Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 132-63
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a theory of legislative institutions that parallels
 the theory of the firm and the theory of contractual institutions. Like
 market institutions, legislative institutions reflect two key components:
 the goals or preferences of individuals (here, representatives seeking
 reelection) and the relevant transactions costs. The authors present three
 conclusions. First, they show how the legislative institutions enforce
 bargains among legislators. Second, they explain why, given the peculiar
 form of bargaining problems found in legislatures, specific forms of
 nonmarket exchange prove superior to market exchange. Third, their
 approach shows how the committee system limits the types of coalitions
 that may form on a particular issue.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On the Optimal Pricing Policy of a Monopolist. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 164-76
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a simple explanation of price dispersion by a
 monopolist assu ming only that consumers arrive in a random order and are
 served on a first-come-first-served basis. A firm can sometimes increase
 its pro fits by charging two different prices for the same good and
 rationing sales at the lower price. However, it is never necessary to
 charge m ore than two prices, and a single price is sufficient as long as
 eith er the marginal revenue curve is everywhere downward sloping or the m
 arginal cost of production is constant.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Foresight and Public Utility Regulation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 177-88
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model that shows the effects of rational
 expectations, and of efficient mark ets, on public utility regulation. It
 is shown that the feedback from investor expectations to regulatory
 behavior, together with investor expectations that take account of this
 feedback, basically alters th e consequences of regulatory decisions. The
 analysis examines the eff ects of a deviation between the allowed rate of
 return and the cost o f capital, with both perfect and imperfect investor
 foresight. It als o assesses the consequences of differing expected growth
 rates. Concl usions are drawn for the effects of regulatory decisions on
 resource misallocation and of regulatory lag on incentives.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Maximum Hours Legislation and Female Employment: A Reassessment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 189-205
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The causes and consequences of state maximum-hours legislation for female
 workers, passed from 1848 to the 1920s, are found to differ from a recent
 interpretation. Altho ugh maximum-hours legislation served to reduce
 scheduled hours in 192 0, the impact was minimal. Curiously, the
 legislation appears to have operated equally for men. Legislation
 affecting only women was sympt omatic of a general desire by labor for
 lower hours, and these lower hours were achieved in the tight, and
 otherwise special, World War I labor market. Most important, the
 restrictiveness of the legislation had no adverse effect on the employment
 share of women in manufacturi ng.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A General Index of Technical Change. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 20-41
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper outlines a procedure for estimating a general index of
 technical change within the context of a qui te general production
 technology. Specifically, when panel data are a vailable for firms in an
 industry, time-specific dummies can be combi ned in a nonlinear estimation
 procedure to yield a general index of t echnical change that may be both
 nonneutral and scale augmenting. The general index can serve as the basis
 for analysis of the determinant s of technical change. Results for a
 sample of thirty electric utilit ies over the period 1951-78 show that the
 productivity decline of the 1970s can be attributed primarily to sulphur
 oxide restrictions and secularly declining capacity utilization due to
 rapidly increasing pe ak-load demands.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Legal Restrictions, "Sunspots," and Peel's Bank Act: The Real Bills Doctrine versus the Quantity Theory Reconsidered. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 3-19
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper considers two questions: (1) what is the purpose of legal
 restrictions intended to separate "money" fr om "credit markets," and (2)
 is such a separation desirable? It is argued that historical legal
 restrictions meant to achieve such a sep aration were designed to preclude
 the occurrence of sunspot equilibri a. It is also shown that a coherent
 model can be constructed in which sunspot equilibria exist in the absence
 of legal restrictions, but n ot if money and credit markets are separated.
 Nevertheless, there is no obvious welfare justification for such a
 separation.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Employment Contracts, Influence Activities, and Efficient Organization Design. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 42-60
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Efficient employment contracts usually fail to compensate workers for the
 effects of posthir ing events and decisions when changing jobs is costly.
 Then, when the re are executives and managers with authority to make
 discretionary decisions, affected employees will be led to waste valuable
 time tryi ng to influence their decisions. Efficient organization design
 coun-t ers this tendency by limiting the discretion of decision makers,
 espe cially for those decisions that have large distributional consequence
 s but that are otherwise of little consequence to the organization.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Takeover Threats and Managerial Myopia. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 61-80
Issue: 1
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the familiar argument that takeover pressure can be
 damaging because i t leads managers to sacrifice long-term interests in
 order to boost c urrent profits. If stockholders are imperfectly informed,
 temporarily low earnings may cause the stock to become undervalued,
 increasing t he likelihood of a takeover at an unfavorable price; hence
 the manage rial concern with current bottom line. The magnitude of the
 problem d epends on a variety of factors, including the attitudes and
 beliefs o f shareholders, the extent to which corporate raiders have
 inside inf ormation, and the degree to which managers are concerned with
 retaini ng control of their firms.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Abstract:
  The existence of backwardation in futures markets remains an intriguing
 and controv ersial issue. The authors show that a backwardation
 equilibrium can o ccur in a true futures market when participants are
 identical (degree of risk aversion, level of commodity commitments for
 long and short hedgers, or probability beliefs) using Hendrik J.
 Houthakker's comple tely neglected notion of an inventory effect that
 results in a patter n in the nearness of cash and futures prices over the
 harvest cycle.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
