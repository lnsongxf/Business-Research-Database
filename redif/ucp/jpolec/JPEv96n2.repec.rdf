Title:   Money and the Stock Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 221-45
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Quarterly data for the period from 1961 to 1986 suggest that the real
 quantity of money (defined as M2) demanded relative to income is
 positively r elated to the deflated price of equities (Standard and Poor's
 composi te) three quarters earlier and negatively related to the
 contemporane ous real stock price. The positive relation appears to
 reflect a weal th effect; the negative, a substitution effect. The wealth
 effect app ears stronger than the substitution effect. The volume of
 transaction s has an appreciable effect on M1 velocity but not on M2
 velocity. An nual data for a century suggest that the apparent dominance
 of the we alth effect is the exception, not the rule.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Permanent and Temporary Components of Stock Prices. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 246-73
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A slowly mean-reverting component of stock prices tends to induce
 negative autocorrelation in returns. The autocorrelation is weak for the
 daily and weekly holding periods common in market efficiency tests but
 stronger for long-horizon returns. In tests for the 1926-85 period, large
 negative autocorrelations for return horizons beyond a year suggest that
 predictable price variation due to mean reversion accounts for large
 fractions of 3 to 5-year return variances. Predictable variation is
 estimated to be about 40 percent of 3 to 5-year return variances for
 portfolios of small firms. The percentage falls to around 25 percent for
 portfolios of large firms.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Mathematical Vindication of Ricardo on Machinery. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 274-82
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Ricardo is shown to be right that machinery can hurt wages and reduce
 output. A dramatic robot example reveals Knut Wicksell's erro r in
 believing that Pareto optimality calls for no drop in total outp ut from a
 viable invention. Under Ricardo's axiom that labor supply a djusts to keep
 wages at the subsistence level, he can correctly deduc e on a
 market-clearing basis a rise in his net product (rent plus int erest),
 while the greater drop in population and total wages results in a
 reduction in his gross product (rent plus interest plus wages).  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Plan and Market in China's Agricultural Commerce. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 283-307
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This article examines interactions between markets and state commercial
 planning in the context of China's agricultural sector. It begins with a
 discussion of recent trends in agricultural planning and commerce in China
 and then presents a theoretical model that analyzes the way that a mixed
 commercial system of the sort observed in China functions. The theoretical
 analysis suggests that a mixed system is sustainable and can have
 desirable efficiency and distributional effects. Markets, however, limit
 the range of sustainable plans, and in the presence of markets, state
 planning may no longer directly influence production and consumption
 behavior.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Is Everything Neutral? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 308-38
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors critique the assumption on which Robert J.
 Barro's dynastic model is predicated and a rgue that this framework is not
 a suitable abstraction in contexts in which the objective is to analyze
 the effects of public policies. Th ey formally consider a world in which
 each generation consists of man y distinct individuals and show that
 family linkages form complex net works, in which each individual may
 belong to many dynastic groupings. The resulting proliferation of linkages
 between families gives rise to a host of neutrality results, including the
 irrelevance of all public distributions, distortionary taxes, and prices.
 Since these results are not at all descriptive of the real world, the
 authors conclude that, in some fundamental sense, the world is not even
 approximatel y dynastic.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Intertemporal Substitution in Consumption. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 339-57
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  One of the important determinants of the response of saving and
 consumption to the real interest rate is the ela sticity of intertemporal
 substitution. That elasticity can be measure d by the response of the rate
 of change of consumption to changes in the expected real interest rate. A
 detailed study of data for the twe ntieth-century United States shows no
 strong evidence that the elasti city of intertemporal substitution is
 positive. Earlier findings of s ubstantially positive elasticities are
 reversed when appropriate esti mation methods are used.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Transactions Costs and Covered Interest Arbitrage: Theory and Evidence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 358-70
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The extent to which deviations from covered interest parity can be
 attributed to transactions costs has been exa ggerated in the economic
 literature because the swap market in foreig n exchange has been ignored.
 It is shown that such deviations should be no greater than the lowest of
 the transactions costs in one of thr ee markets: the swap market or either
 of the two relevant securities markets. This reconciles the theory with
 the data, which show spreads of no more than a few basis points. However,
 the empirical results h ave no direct bearing on the conventional market
 efficiency hypothesi s.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Why Have Some Farmers Opposed Futures Markets? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 371-82
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A self-interest explanation is presented for opposition by some farm
 groups to futures markets. During the twenties and thirties, political
 oppositi on to futures markets was greater in the grain-producing states.
 The line elevator companies were prominent in these states and not others
 , and used futures prices to facilitate a buying cartel. Futures pric es
 were used to derive a suggested buying price for elevator purchase s in
 each local market. The political opposition to futures by farmer s was
 designed to raise the cost of operating local cartels. Politic al
 opposition was greater, and gross profit margins of elevators were higher
 in state with line elevators.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Time and Punishment: An Intertemporal Model of Crime. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 383-90
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  If an increase in the rate at which a criminal commits crimes lowers the
 expected time until detection, the income from crime (net of expected
 fines) must be dis counted at a rate that varies with the crime rate. This
 paper models the criminal's choice of the optimal crime rate under such
 conditions. It is shown that, irrespective of the criminal's attitude
 toward risk, an increase in the probability of detection is more likely to
 deter crime than a comparable increase in penalties. Other implications of
 the model for the optimal enforcement of laws are also explored.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Accounting for Changes in Tastes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 391-410
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Health concerns are thought by many to have shifted consumption away from
 red meats, though econometric evidence is mixed. Testing for structural
 change is difficult, especially when on e time series is used for both
 estimating demand equations and testin g their stability. Specification
 errors may suggest a shift where non e has occurred. Using nonparametric
 demand analysis, the authors find that meat consumption patterns in the
 United States and Australia ca n be explained using only relative prices
 and expenditures. Only impo sing particular functional forms can reverse
 the conclusion, suggesti ng that specification errors in econometric
 demand studies can accoun t for findings of taste changes.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Compensating Differentials and Self-selection: An Application to Lawyers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 411-28
Issue: 2
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper models individual choice between two types of jobs as
 dependent on the difference i n potential earnings and on preferences for
 nonpecuniary compensation. The model leads to simultaneous estimation of
 earnings and job choice functions in a manner that takes account of
 self-selection of individuals into the sector of highest utility. An
 application to lawyers choosing between private and "public-interest" law
 casts doubt on the notion that public-interest lawyers are accepting
 substantially lower earnings by virtue of their choice-an impression
 derived from es timation of earnings functions without accounting for
 self-selection. The estimation technique also takes proper account of the
 "'choice-based" nature of the sample.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
