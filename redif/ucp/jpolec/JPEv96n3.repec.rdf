Title:   Incentives in Academics: Why Is There Tenure? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 453-72
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper models an academic department as an internal labor market. The
 major problem facing the university administration is t o ensure that
 members of its departments are willing to hire the best possible
 candidates. Academic tenure is seen to be a necessary condi tion for this.
 The analysis is also consistent with other aspects of the academic
 environment including "tenure-track" appointments, contr act buy-outs,
 early retirement plans, and, when a budget crunch hits, the elimination of
 entire departments. The results extend in a sim ple way to other
 organizations in which members have an input into ov erall decisions.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Nonuniform Pricing Model of Union Wages and Employment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 473-508
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Unlike implicit contracts models, the nonuniform pricing model of unions
 assumes that firms can always shut down ex post to avo id any payments to
 the union. Under this restriction, employment can differ from a first-best
 even if both workers and firms are risk neut ral. In general, the union
 chooses to offer quantity discounts on lab or and needs to use a seniority
 rule that regulates the order in whic h workers are hired to implement
 these discounts. Unions lower (almos t) all workers' employment
 probabilities and increase the cyclical vo latility of employment, and the
 union-nonunion average wage different ial will move countercyclically.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Division of Labor, Local Markets, and Worker Organization. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 509-27
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The model developed here explains differences in the degree of the
 division of labor across local markets. For example, the typical doctor in
 one local market may treat a wider range of patients' problems than his
 counterpart in another local market. The extent of the division of labor
 depends on variables affecting the local demand for services. Two
 different forms of worker organization, cooperation and noncooperation,
 yield divergent results. For example, specialization increases with the
 local number of producers under cooperation but may decrease under
 noncooperation. With the number of producers constant, local demand
 variables affect individual specialization under noncooperation but not
 under cooperation.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Gibson's Paradox and the Gold Standard. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 528-50
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper contributes a new element to the explanations of the Gibson
 paradox, the puzzling correlation between interest rates and the price
 level seen during the gold-standard peri od. A shock that raises the
 underlying real rate of return in the eco nomy reduces the equilibrium
 relative price of gold and, with the nom inal price of gold pegged by the
 authorities, must raise the price le vel. The mechanism involves the
 allocation of gold between monetary a nd nonmonetary uses. The authors'
 explanation helps to resolve some i mportant anomalies in previous work
 and is supported by empirical evi dence along a number of dimensions.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Characteristics Model, Hedonic Prices, and the Clientele Effect. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 551-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the characteristics model of Kelvin Lancaster is
 reconsidered. It is shown by example that equili brium prices need not be
 linearly decomposable. It does follow that e quilibrium prices must be a
 convex function of characteristics, howev er. Further, it is shown that
 this fact holds independent of the form of firm competition (e.g., perfect
 or monopolistic). Finally, the pr edictions of the theory are discussed in
 the context of two empirical examples.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Distinguishing Panics and Information-Based Bank Runs: Welfare and Policy Implications. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 568-92
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors contrast panics and information-based bank
 runs in an effort to provide a robust and empirically plausib le model of
 how bank runs are triggered. The model of information-bas ed runs is
 characterized by two-sided asymmetric information: the ban k cannot
 observe the true liquidity needs of the depositors while dep ositors are
 asymmetrically informed about bank asset quality. They al so examine the
 relative degrees of risk sharing provided by bank depo sit contracts and
 traded equity contracts. They show that the choice of deposit or equity
 depends on the attributes of and information abo ut the underlying
 investment returns.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Neoclassical Model of Unemployment and the Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 593-617
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates a general equilibrium model of unemployment and
 the business cycle in which specialization of labor plays a key role. A
 rational expectations equilibrium with ful ly flexible wages and prices
 can exhibit unemployment in which the ma rginal product of employed
 workers exceeds the reservation wage of th ose who are without jobs.
 Workers are unemployed either because they are in the process of
 relocating for a better job or because they are waiting for conditions in
 the depressed sector to improve. Moreover, seemingly small disruptions in
 the supplies of primary commodities s uch as energy could be the source of
 fluctuations in aggregate employ ment and can exert surprisingly large
 effects on real output.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Intergenerational Flows of Time and Goods: Consequences of Slowing Population Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 618-51
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a theoretical model of intergenerational transfers
 inc orporating time use. With the aid of time budget and consumer expendi
 ture surveys, empirical estimates of the age profiles of various type s of
 time and goods consumption are presented, and the authors conclu de that
 (1) the net direction of intergenerational transfers is from younger to
 older ages; (2) under the golden-rule assumption, these tr ansfers largely
 constitute an externality to childbearing; and (3) th ey are not large
 enough to offset the capital dilution effect that wo uld result from
 higher fertility and more rapid population growth.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Institutional Framework and Economic Development. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 652-62
Issue: 3
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The compound growth rates per capita output and Farrell-type efficiency
 measures for 115 market economies over the period 1960-80 were compared
 with measures of political, civil, and economic li berty. It was found
 that the institutional framework has significant and large effects on the
 efficiency and growth rate of economies. Pol itically open societies,
 which subscribe to the rule of law, to priva te property, and to the
 market allocation of resources, grow at three times the rate and are two
 and one-half times as efficient as societ ies in which these freedoms are
 abridged.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
