Title:   A Theory of Rational Addiction. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 675-700
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a theory of rational addiction in which rationality
 means a consistent plan to maximize utility over time. Strong addiction to
 a good requires a big effect of past consumption of the good on current
 consumption. Such powerful complementarities cause some steady states to
 be unstable. They are an important part of the authors' analysis be-cause
 even small deviations from the consumption at an unstable steady state can
 lead to large cumulative rises over time in addictive consumption or to
 rapid falls in consumption to abstention. Their theory also impies that
 "cold turkey" is used to end strong addictions, that addicts often go on
 binges, that addicts respond more to permanent than to temporary changes
 in prices of addictive goods, and that anxiety and tensions can
 precipitate an addiction.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Learning by Doing and the Introduction of New Goods. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 701-17
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  A dynamic general equilibrium model is developed in which goods are
 valued according to the characteristics they contain; the set of goods
 produced in any period is endogenously determined; and learning by doing
 is the force behind sustained growth. It is shown that the set of produced
 goods changes in a systematic way over time, with goods of higher quality
 entering each period and those of lower quality dropping out. The model is
 then used to study the effect of introducing a "traditional" sector in
 which there is no learning.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Housing Investment in the United States. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 718-40
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  A supply-determined model of housing investment is estimated from
 quarterly data over the 1963-83 period. The model is built on dynamic
 marginal cost pricing considerations and allows short- and long-run supply
 elasticities to differ. These are estimated as 1.0 and 3.0, respectively,
 but most of the long-run response occurs within one year. Rapid adjustment
 speed and the sizable long-run elasticity of supply are important factors
 in understanding the volatility of housing investment. The data also
 suggest some anomalies in the expected present value theory of asset
 pricing for housing capital.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Innovation and Reputation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 741-65
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a monopolist that markets successive generations of
 new and improving nondurable products. Prices, research intensity, and
 product innovations are derived as sequential equilibrium outcomes to a
 dynamic game with incomplete information. Asymmetric information is an
 important feature of the model. The monopolist is fully aware of the
 current product's quality, as are consumers who have tried it. However,
 the beliefs of other people are characterized by a probability
 distribution that depends on the monopolist's marketing strategy and the
 product's popularity. The analysis illustrates a new context in which
 price signaling might serve as a mechanism for ensuring that only high-
 quality products are marketed.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Unlimited Liability as a Barrier to Entry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 766-84
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Many, but not all, firms have the freedom to choose liability rules. In
 some countries, service professions have unlimited liability rules imposed
 by government; historically, banks in some countries faced unlimited
 liability. Why do governments impose unlimited liability? This is the
 question the authors address. With a simple model, they illustrate the
 agency conflicts in firms. Limited liability solves these conflicts
 efficiently. Unlimited liability raises the cost of capital; inefficiently
 small firms result. But under some conditions, selectively-applied
 unlimited liability rules protect rents. The authors test several
 propositions with data on Scottish banking and U.S. law firms.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   High School Graduation, Performance, and Wages. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 785-820
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a proprietary
 sample of semiskilled production workers, this paper investigates the
 reasons for the discontinuous increase in wages associated with graduation
 from high school. The author finds a discontinuous decrease in workers'
 propensities to quit or be absent. However, he does not find that
 graduates have a comparative advantage in production jobs requiring more
 training, nor in either sample is there a discontinuous increase in
 required training associated with the jobs held by graduates. The wage
 premium associated with graduation from high school appears to be
 procyclical, falling during slumps. There is also some evidence suggesting
 that prior quits have a larger effect on the wages of graduates than on
 the wages of dropouts.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   General Equilibrium with Real Time Search in Labor and Product Market s. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 821-31
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper is concerned with economies in which agents find sellers and
 employers in a time-consuming search process while they simultaneously
 trade with their current partners. A symmetric steady-state equilibrium
 does not exist, but asymmetric steady-state equilibria exist and are such
 that larger firms offer higher wages and charge lower prices than smaller
 firms, but still make more profits. These profits can be seen as rents
 from a superior market position.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Reputation and Hierarchy in Dynamic Models of Employment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 832-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The employment relationship with employees' ability and their actions,
 both private information (thus combining adverse selection with moral
 hazard), is modeled as a repeated game with self-enforcing contracts being
 perfect Bayesian-Nash equilibria. Under termination contracts, the
 equilibrium contract structure consists of a hierarchy of ranks, finite in
 number even though ability is continuous. Reputation acts as an effective
 device for worker discipline without the need for involuntary
 unemployment. Selection by bonding is not, in general, incentive
 compatible, but selection by promotion of employees through the ranks is.
 Many other features correspond to observed employment structures.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Estimates of the Returns to Quality and Coauthorship in Economic Academia. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 855-66
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Salaries of academic economists are studied to determine if individuals
 receive differential returns to publishing articles of varying quality and
 to coauthored versus single-authored articles. Estimates based on detailed
 data and a flexible nonlinear least-squares procedure indicate that
 substantial returns to quality exist and that an individual's return from
 a coauthored paper with n authors is approximately 1/n times that of a
 single-authored paper.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 867-81
Issue: 4
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Tournament contracts are characterized that simultaneously elicit
 first-best efficient effort levels and self -selection of risk-neutral
 heterogeneous workers into ability-specific contracts. Comparisons across
 self-selected ability types are shown to be sometimes necessary to attain
 efficiency. Rationales are explored for not commonly observing such
 contracts in hierarchical organizations.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
