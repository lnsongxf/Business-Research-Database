Title:   An Analysis of Congressional Voting on Legislation Limiting Congressional Campaign Expenditures. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1005-21
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Congressional voting on proposed floor amendments concerned solely with
 setting the level of the election campaign expenditure ceiling provision
 of the House Administration Committee's broad campaign finance reform bill
 of 1974 is analyzed for consistency with either the public-interest or
 economic theories of regulation. The benefit or cost to the individual
 congressman of a given ceiling is defined as the implied increase or
 decrease in his probability of reelection under the ceiling. Logit
 regression analysis provides the preponderant support for the economic
 theory of regulation by indicating that the likelihood of voting for a
 given ceiling varies directly with the implied change in reelection
 probability under the ceiling and is quite sensitive to the implied
 change.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Organized Labor and the Scope of International Specialization. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1022-47
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the interaction between union wages and the
 international pattern of production and trade. If union goods are
 heterogeneous in labor intensity, the introduction of an active union in
 the domestic country causes only the least labor-intensive range of union
 goods to be produced there, with goods of greatest labor intensity
 produced abroad because of the relatively high cost of domestic union
 labor. A narrowing of the scope of domestic union production will
 eliminate relatively labor-intensive goods, leading a rent-maximizing
 union to raise its union premium. The implications of this union behavior
 for comparative statics results are considered.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Balanced Matching and Labor Market Equilibrium. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1048-65
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze equilibrium in a labor market wherein it takes time
 for the workers to contact forms. Workers, assumed identical, repeatedly
 sell their labor services all through their work lives, choosing their
 search intensity endogenously. Identical firms attempt to maximize their
 steady-state profit flow. The authors focus on the importance and
 consequences of balanced matching, in which workers are more likely to
 contact a larger firm. A unique equilibrium is shown to exist wherein all
 firms offer the same wage and select an employment level at which wage
 equals marginal product. The effect of traditional labor market policies
 and empirical implications are discussed.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Mr. Smith and the Preachers: The Economics of Religion in the Wealth of Nations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1066-88
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The extension of economic analysis to problems beyond the domain of
 formal markets and explicit prices represents a major recent intellectual
 development. But "economic imperialism" is not new and was not invented in
 Chicago. Adam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, extended economic reasoning
 to a variety of nonmarket exchange problems. One example is his analysis
 of religious behavior. Smith viewed participation in religion as a
 rational device by which individuals enhanced the value of their human
 capital. He also explained the behavior of the clergy and other suppliers
 of religious services from an economic perspective.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   How Big Is the Random Walk in GNP? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 893-920
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a measure of the persistence of fluctuations in gross
 national product (GNP) based on the variance of its long differences. That
 measure finds little long-term persistence in GNP. Previous research on
 this question found a great deal of persistence in GNP, suggesting models
 such as a random walk. A reconciliation of this paper's results with
 previous research shows that conventional criteria for time-series model
 building can produce misleading estimates of persistence.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Relation between Price and Marginal Cost in U.S. Industry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 921-47
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  An examination of data on output and labor input reveals that some U.S.
 industries have marginal cost well below price. The conclusion rests on
 the finding that cyclical variations in labor input are small compared
 with variations in output. In booms, firms produce substantially more
 output and sell it for a price that exceeds the costs of the added inputs.
 This paper documents the disparity between price and marginal cost, where
 marginal cost is estimated from annual variations in cost. It considers a
 variety of explanations of the findings that are consistent with
 competition, but none is found to be completely plausible.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Physicians' Services and the Division of Labor across Local Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 948-82
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper reports empirical evidence of systematic cross-locale
 variation in the degree of division of labor among physicians. A
 theoretical model-based on an individual producer's trade-off between
 increasing returns and falling marginal revenue within each
 activity-motivates the empirical tests. At two levels of aggregation,
 specialization is correlated with local demand shifters for medical
 services. At the individual level, the author finds systematic differences
 in the range of procedures performed within a specialty class. General
 practitioners working fewer hours, practicing in more populated counties,
 or practicing in counties with more elderly produce a narrower range of
 procedures.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Are Consumers Ricardian? Evidence for the United States. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 983-1004
Issue: 5
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper derives three empirical implications of a well-specified model
 of consumer behavior, a model that nests both Ricardian equivalence and an
 alternative, non-Ricardian theory. Ricardian equivalence is then tested
 against this alternative. The tests reveal that Ricardian equivalence
 cannot be rejected.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
