Title:   The Case of the Negative Nominal Interest Rates: New Estimates of the Term Structure of Interest Rates during the Great Depression. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1111-41
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, U.S. Treasury bonds and notes
 appeared to have negative nominal yields as they approached maturity. But
 negative nominal interest rates are impossible in a world in which one can
 always hold cash. The resolution to this puzzle is that Treasury
 securities, in addition to making coupon payments, gave the owner the
 right to buy a new security on a future date. This paper describes the
 institutional environment that led to the apparent negative nominal
 interest rates; develops a method for valuing the "exchange privilege";
 and computes accurate measures of the yield to the coupon-bearing
 component of these composite bond/options.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Welfare Effects of British Free Trade: Debate and Evidence from the 1840s. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1142-64
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Classical economists engaged in a vigorous debate over whether Britain's
 tariff reductions in the 1840s should be made contingent on tariff
 liberalization abroad. Some, notably Robert Torrens, believed that a
 unilateral tariff reduction would so deteriorate British terms of trade as
 to outweigh efficiency gains and make the country worse off. In this
 paper, Britain's foreign trade elasticities are estimated for this period
 in a simultaneous equation model. They are used in a simple general
 equilibrium model that explicitly takes the terms of trade into account to
 assess the welfare impact of tariff reductions. The results indicate that
 Britain would have been made worse off from a unilateral tariff reduction.
 However, foreign tariff reductions mitigated the terms of trade
 deterioration and could easily have made Britain better off.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Altruism and Time Consistency: The Economics of Fait Accompli. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1165-82
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the strategic and intertemporal interaction between
 two economic agents who have "overlapping" concerns, such as altruistic
 concerns for each other's welfare. The agents may be two individuals, a
 social bureau and a client, or two units in an organization. The authors
 show how the presence of such common concerns may lead to socially
 inefficient outcomes, in which one economic agent "free rides" on the
 other's concerns. They also brief ly discuss how this inefficiency and
 free riding, in the context of interaction between individuals, might be
 mitigated by compulsory social security systems. As another example, the
 authors interpret th e inefficiency in terms of Janos Kornai's "soft
 budget constraints" within organizations.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumption Technology and the Intrafamily Distribution of Resources:. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1183-1205
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper shows that the definition and the measurement of adult
 equivalence scales depend crucially on the concept of welfare used. When
 welfare is the utility parents derive from their own consumption , one has
 to assume separability of parents' and children's consumption. This
 assumption implies that the only way of imputing the intrafamily
 allocation of resources is by observing the consumption patterns of adult
 goods. Regardless of the definition used, one cannot separate the factors
 reflecting home technology (i.e., "needs") from those determining the
 intrafamily distribution rule (i.e., "wants") out of consumption data.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Risk, Futures Pricing, and the Organization of Production in Commodity Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1206-20
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines equilibrium in a spot and futures market with both
 primary producers (growers) and intermediate producers (processo rs). For
 a commodity that is subject to output shocks, processors tend to hedge
 long, in contrast with J. R. Hicks's theory of futures hedging.
 Nevertheless, if transaction costs are low, the two-stage production
 process brings about a downward futures price bias, consistent with
 Hicks's pricing prediction. But if costs of trading futures are high,
 growers tend to be differentially driven from the futures market,
 reversing the direction of the bias. Futures trading may also affect the
 organization of industry.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Efficiency of Investment in the Presence of Aggregate Demand Spillovers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1221-31
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In the presence of aggregate demand spillovers, an imperfectly
 competitive firm's profit is positively related to aggregate income, which
 in turn rises with profits of all firms in the economy. This pecuniary
 externality makes a dollar of a firm's profit raise aggrega te income by
 more than a dollar, since other firms' profits also rise, and in this way
 gives rise to a "multiplier." Since such multipliers are ignored by firms
 making investment decisions, privately optimal investment decisions under
 uncertainty will not, in general, be socially optimal. Under reasonable
 conditions, investmen t is too low.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Real Wages over the Business Cycle: Estimating the Impact of Heterogeneity with Micro Data. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1232-66
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  New evidence on the correlation between the cycle and the real wage is
 provided by using panel data to adjust for the aggregation cum selectivity
 bias that arises when those who move in and out of the work force over the
 cycle have systematically different unobserved permanent and transitory
 wage components than those who do not. The results show that selectivity
 bias is present, for those with high transitory wages are more likely to
 lose employment, and that a true, compositio n-constant real wage index
 moves countercyclically, but less quantitatively than previous estimates
 using micro data have suggested.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Structure of Simple General Equilibrium Models with Frictional Unemployment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1267-93
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a two-sector general equilibrium model in which
 equilibrium unemployment arises endogenously because of trading frictions
 in the labor market of one sector. Externalities inherent in the search
 process lead to inefficient equi libria, and this has important
 implications for the basic structure of the economy. In particular, the
 relationship between factor rewards and commodity prices is fundamentally
 different from the analogous relationship in a frictionless economy. One
 implication is that the economy's relative supply curve may be downward
 sloping, especially when the search sector is small. The authors also
 present several applications of the analysis.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Women's Labor Supply and Marital Choice. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1294-1302
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper hypothesizes that value of time, and consequently labor force
 participation, can vary with circumstances specific to a marriage or a
 marriage market. Wives' traits valued in the marriage market are expected
 to be associated with lower labor-force participation, whereas husbands'
 traits valued in the marriage market are expected to be associated with
 lower participation rates on the part of wives. Evidence for these
 hypotheses is found on the basis of regressions of labor-force
 participation for a sample of Israeli married women. Inclusion of traits
 valued in the marriage market and marital sorting patterns increases the
 explanatory power of the regressions.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Price Dispersion and Inflation: Evidence from Israel. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1303-14
Issue: 6
Volume: 96
Year: 1988
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper considers the question of whether observed price differe
 ntials reflect perceived differences in quality, service agreements, or
 location, or whether information imperfections can explain this
 phenomenon. It sets out theoretical arguments linking inflation to
 reductions in the information stock held by agents and thus to greater
 price dispersion. The hypothesis is tested using monthly price data for
 thirteen uniquely-defined goods sold in Israel between 1971 and 1984.
 Price dispersion is shown to be positively related to the rate of market
 price inflation. Since inflation is an unlikely proxy for changes in
 perceived characteristics, the findings support price dispersion theories
 based on "optimally imperfect" decision making.  Copyright 1988 by University of Chicago Press.
