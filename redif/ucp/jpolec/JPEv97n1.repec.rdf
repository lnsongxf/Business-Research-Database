Title:   The Prewar Business Cycle Reconsidered: New Estimates of Gross National Product, 1869-1908. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-37
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Traditional estimates of prewar gross national product (GNP) exaggerate
 the size of cycles because they are based on the assumption that GNP moves
 approximately one for one with commodity output valued in producer prices.
 This paper derives new estimates of GNP for 1869-1908 using an estimate of
 the actual relationship between GNP and commodity output. This estimated
 relationship is allowed to be time-varying and is derived from a
 regression covering the periods 1909-28 and 1947-85. The new estimates of
 GNP indicate that there has been much less stabilization between the
 prewar and postwar eras than is conventionally believed.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Safety Regulation of U.S. Nuclear Power Plants: Violations, Inspections, and Abnormal Occurrences. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 115-54
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Data from more than one-thousand inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory
 Commission form the basis for an investigation into the nature of safety
 regulation at U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. Poisson (and binary
 choice) models of the rate of occurrence of violations during each
 inspection period are specified, and are extended to control for
 nondetection and for the possibility that violations persist from one
 inspection to the next. These models are used to study the factors
 associated with noncompliance, relative rankings of plants according to
 propensity to violate, the variation in detection rates among Nuclear
 Regulatory Commission inspectors, and the relationship between undetected
 violations and abnormal occurrences.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Constant Recontracting Model of Sovereign Debt. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 155-78
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors present a dynamic model of international lending in whi ch
 borrowers cannot commit to future repayments and debtors can sometime s
 successfully negotiate partial defaults or "rescheduling agreements." All
 parties in a debt rescheduling negotiation realize that today's
 rescheduling agreement may itself have to be renegotiated in the future.
 The authors' bargaining-theoretic approach allows them to handle the
 effects of uncertainty on sovereign debt contracts in a much more
 satisfactory way than in earlier analyses. The framework is readily
 extended to analyze the conflicting interests of different lenders, and of
 banks and creditor-country taxpayers.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Influence of Household Composition on Household Expenditure Patterns: Theory and Spanish Evidence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 179-200
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  A concept of demographic separability is proposed that formalizes t he
 notion that there are groups of goods (adult goods) that have little or no
 relationship to specific classes of household demographics (the numbers or
 ages of children). That there exist adult goods demographically separable
 from children is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the
 validity of Erwin Rothbarth's method for measuring child costs. The
 authors propose two different methods for testing demographic separability
 and present results from a 1981 survey of Spain. The econometric evidence
 is in fair agreement with t he theoretical presuppositions.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Experimental Evaluation of Weakest Link/Best Shot Models of Public Goods. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 201-25
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  In the supply of public goods, far less free riding actually occurs than
 traditional theory predicts. As one explanation, the social composition
 function, which aggregates individual contributions into an available
 social total, may not always take the standard summation form. Theoretical
 considerations indicate that free riding should be least for a social
 composition function of the weakest-link type but greatest for the
 best-shot type. Using a sequential protocol, the authors' experiments
 strongly confirm theoretical anticipations under all three types of social
 composition functions. Even under the more onerous sealed-bid
 (simultaneous play ) protocol, the experimental subjects are able to make
 some partial progress toward the theoretical ideal.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Estimation of Prewar Gross National Product: Methodology and New Evidence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 38-92
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper develops new methodology for the estimation of prewar gross
 national product (GNP), taps previously unused data sources, an d develops
 new estimates for the periods 1869-1908 and 1869-1928. Primary among the
 new data sources are direct measures of output in the transportation,
 communications, and construction sectors, and estimates of the consumer
 price index. New measures of real GNP, nominal GNP, and the GNP deflator
 are developed. The new estimates of real GNP are as volatile, on average,
 over the business cycle as the traditional Kuznets-Kendrick series, but
 dampen the amplitude of som e cycles while raising the amplitude of
 others. The new estimates of th e GNP deflator are distinctly less
 volatile than the traditional series and, in fact, no more volatile than
 those in the postwar period.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Malthus Was Right after All: Poor Relief and Birth Rates in Southeastern England. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 93-114
Issue: 1
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The payment of child allowances to laborers with large families was
 widespread in early nineteenth-century England. This paper tests Thomas
 Malthus's hypothesis that child allowances caused the birth rate to
 increase. A cross-sectional regression model is estimated to explain
 variations in birth rates across parishes in 1826-30. Birth rates are
 found to be related to child allowances, income, and the availability of
 housing, as Malthus contended. The paper concludes by examining the role
 played by the adoption of child allowances after 1795 in the fertility
 increase of the early nineteenth century.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
