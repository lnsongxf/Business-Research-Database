Title:   Two Models of Measurements and the Investment Accelerator. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 251-87
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper describes two models of an agency that is collecting and
 reporting observations on a dynamical linear stochastic economy. The first
 is a "classical" model, with the agency reporting data that are the sum of
 a vector of "true" variables and a vector of measurement errors that are
 orthogonal to the true variables. The second is a model of an agency that
 uses an optimal filtering method to construct least-squares estimates of
 the true variables. These two models of the reporting agency imply
 different likelihood functions. A model of the investment accelerator is
 used as an example to illustrate the differing implications of the models.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Social Security Benefits, Consumption Expenditure, and the Life Cycle Hypothesis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 288-304
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the impact of changes in social security benefits on
 aggregate consumption expenditure. Under the null hypothesis, there should
 be no contemporaneous effect at the monthly frequency because increases in
 benefits have always been announced at least six weeks prior to payment.
 The paper develops overwhelming evidence--contrary to the null--that
 benefits have affected aggregate spending. The results have strong
 implications for several important issues, including Ricardian
 equivalence, government policy irrelevance, and the excess sensitivity of
 consumption to changes in income.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumption and Liquidity Constraints: An Empirical Investigation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 305-46
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Several recent studies have suggested that empirical rejections of the
 permanent income/life cycle model may be due to the existence of liquidity
 constraints. This paper tests the permanent income hypothesis against the
 alternative hypothesis that consumers optimize subject to a well-specified
 sequence of borrowing constraints. Implications for consumption in the
 presence of borrowing constraints are derived and then tested using
 time-series/cross-section data on families from the Panel Study of Income
 Dynamics. The results generally support the hypothesis that an inability
 to borrow against future labor income affects the consumption of a
 significant portion of the population.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Public Ownership of the External World and Private Ownership of Self. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 347-67
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Liberal political philosophy defends great inequality of economic outcome
 on the basis that people own themselves and are entitled to establish
 private property in the external world by virtue of self-ownership.
 Contemporary nonlibertarian political philosophers, such as John Rawls and
 Ronald Dworkin, achieve their relatively egalitarian conclusions by
 denying self-ownership as a premise. An alternative challenge to
 libertarianism, which does not take that radical step, is to declare that
 while self-ownership should be respected at least to a degree, productive
 assets in the external world be viewed as publicly owned. The authors
 propose an axiomatic approach to modeling public and private property
 rights, and characterize the class of allocation mechanisms, acting on a
 domain of economic environments, which satisfy these axioms.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Nash Equilibrium Tariffs for the United States and Canada: The Roles of Country Size, Scale Economies, and Capital Mobility. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 368-86
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A theoretical analysis of "optimal" (Nash equilibrium) tariff rates is
 presented. A numerical general equilibrium model is then used to find Nash
 equilibrium tariff rates for the United States and Canada. The Nash
 equilibrium tariffs are small relative to partial equilibrium estimates:
 18 percent for the United States and 6 percent for Canada. The United
 States is essentially indifferent between the Nash equilibrium and free
 trade, while Canada is better off at the latter by $4 billion. Empirical
 results support theoretical predictions that the optimal tariff is smaller
 when the country is smaller, there are scale economies and free entry, and
 capital is internationally mobile.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Changing Empirical Definition of Money: Some Estimates from a Model of the Demand for Money Substitutes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 387-97
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Interest-bearing checkable deposits are examined to test whether they
 should be included in measures of the U.S. money stock. Both Divisia and
 traditional simple-sum aggregates are constructed on the basis of tests
 for weak separability in a model of the demand for financial assets. Using
 nonparametric demand analysis, the authors find that several groups of
 assets are compatible with aggregation theory. They find empirical support
 for a narrow measure consisting of the components of current M1A. In tests
 based on a St. Louis equation and in terms of controllability, a Divisia
 aggregate performs better than the simple-sum M1A measure.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Family Resources, Family Size, and Access to Financing for College Education. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 398-419
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Unequal access to financing for education may be an important source of
 educational differences. The authors develop a model relating sib
 schooling and earnings similarities to sibship, size with and without
 equal access, and estimate it for the education of veterans, for whom the
 GI Bill assured equal access, and for their children, who had no such
 government assistance. They find an inverse relationship between sibship
 size and sib schooling and earnings similarities for the children, but not
 for the veterans. They conclude that, in the absence of equal access
 policies, unequal access is an important source of educational
 differences.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Unbundling the Voting Rights and Profit Claims of Common Shares. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 420-43
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a model of a hostile takeover attempt in which
 shareholders are free to sell common-share voting rights, as well as the
 shares themselves. Without taxation, only welfare-improving takeovers
 succeed. Allowing vote sales has no effect on the success of attempted
 takeovers or the profits of incumbent management or raiders. When taxes
 are levied, however, an inefficiently small number of value-increasing
 takeovers succeed if vote sales are prohibited. Allowing vote sales
 facilitates such takeovers and raises welfare. With taxation, incumbents
 would never prefer to defend against takeovers by purchasing votes, but
 raiders might well prefer this method.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Welfare Analysis of Product Innovations, with an Application to Computed Tomography Scanners. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 444-79
Issue: 2
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper puts forward a methodology for the measurement of product
 innovations using a value metric, that is, equating the "magnitude" of
 innovations with the welfare gains they generate. This research design is
 applied to the case of computed tomography scanners, a revolutionary
 innovation in medical technology. The econometric procedure centers on the
 estimation of a discrete choice model (the nested multinomial logit),
 which yields the parameters of a utility function defined over the
 changing quality dimensions of the innovative product. The estimated flow
 of social gains from innovation is used to compute a social rate of return
 to R&D, to explore the interrelation between innovation and diffusion, and
 to trace the time profile of benefits.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
