Title:   The Seasonal Cycle and the Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 503-34
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Almost all recent research on macroeconomic fluctuations has worked with
 seasonally-adjusted or annual data. This paper takes a different approach
 by examining the seasonal movements themselves. The authors' results show
 that seasonal fluctuations are an important source of variation in all
 macroeconomic quantity variables, but are small or absent in price
 variables. The paper also demonstrates that at seasonal frequencies, as
 well as at business cycle frequencies, output movements across
 broadly-defined sectors move together, the timing of production and the
 timing of sales coincide closely, labor productivity is procyclical,
 nominal money and real output are highly correlated, and prices vary less
 than quantities.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Tulipmania. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 535-60
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Though it is always mentioned first among the list of obvious manias, no
 serious effect has ever been expended to investigate the market
 fundamentals that might have driven the tulip speculation. The paper
 compiles time series on individual tulip prices and examines market
 fundamentals potentially driving prices. Most of the "tulipmania" was not
 obvious madness. High, but rapidly depreciating, prices for rare bulbs is
 a typical pattern in the flower-bulb industry. Only the last month of the
 speculation, during which common-bulb prices increased rapidly and
 crashed, remains as a potential bubble.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Pay Equality and Industrial Politics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 561-80
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Personnel managers often argue that equitable pay treatment manifested as
 wage compression is useful because it reduces disharmony among workers.
 But it is far from obvious that a compressed salary structure is morale
 improving since better workers may feel disenchanted by this scheme.
 However, when workers' rewards are based on relative comparisons, salary
 compression reduces uncooperative behavior that is detrimental to the
 firm. Relative comparisons imply that some reference group must be
 selected. The major result is that, within the relevant groups, some wage
 compression is efficient.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumer Discrimination and Self-employment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 581-605
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Self-employment rates and incomes differ significantly by race. The
 authors show that these differentials arise in markets with consumer
 discrimination and incomplete information about the price of the good and
 the race of the seller. Equilibrium income distributions have two
 properties: mean black incomes are lower than mean white incomes, and the
 returns to ability are lower for black than for white sellers. Able
 blacks, therefore, are less likely to self-select into the self-employment
 sector than able whites. Using the 1980 census data, the authors find that
 observed racial differences in the self-employment income distributions
 are consistent with the theoretical predictions.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rational Expectations Business Cycles in Search Equilibrium. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 606-19
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the rational expectations equilibrium paths of the
 model of search and barter in Peter A. Diamond's "Aggregate Demand
 Management in Search Equilibrium" (1982). For some initial positions,
 there are two equilibrium paths converging to different steady states,
 with the high-activity path Pareto-dominating the low-activity path. With
 some parameters, there is also a continuum of equilibrium paths converging
 to another steady state. Moreover, there can be cycles that are
 equilibrium paths, even though the environment is stationary.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Entry and Exit Decisions under Uncertainty. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 620-38
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A firm's entry and exit decisions when the output price follows a random
 walk are examined. An idle firm and an active firm are viewed as assets
 that are call options on each other. The solution is a pair of trigger
 prices for entry and exit. The entry trigger exceeds the variable cost
 plus the interest on the entry cost, and the exit trigger is less than the
 variable cost minus the interest on the exit cost. These gaps produce
 "hysteresis." Numerical solutions are obtained for several parameter
 values; hysteresis is found to be significant even with small sunk costs.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Joint Determination of Union Status and Union Wage Effects: Some Tests of Alternative Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 639-67
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The problems of estimation and interpretation of union wage differentials
 are examined. The properties of cross-section and longitudinal estimators
 are compared. Estimates are presented and those in the literature
 summarized. Conflicting results are obtained. Longitudinal estimators
 typically produce results smaller than those of ordinary least squares,
 while cross-section methods raise the estimate. The paper offers a
 reconciliation of these results. It supports a more optimistic conclusion
 than that reached in reviews by Richard B. Freeman and H. Gregg Lewis, who
 argued that little has been learned from attempts to deal with the
 endogeneity issue. Comparisons between estimators are used to throw light
 on the process governing union status and to suggest interpretations of
 "union differentials" consistent with the current evidence.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Mechanism Design with Incomplete Information: A Solution to the Implementation Problem. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 668-91
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The main result of this paper is that the multiple equilibrium problem in
 mechanism design can be avoided in private-value models if agents do not
 use weakly-dominated strategies in equilibrium. The authors show that, in
 such settings, any incentive-compatible allocation rule can be made the
 unique equilibrium outcome to a mechanism. They derive a general necessary
 condition for unique implementation that implies that the positive result
 for private-value models applies with considerably less generality to
 common-value settings.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Labor Specialization and the Extent of the Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 692-705
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper presents an analytical model of labor specialization. Workers
 make human capital investment decisions on the depth and the breadth of
 their skill. Given that firms have diverse job requirements and increasing
 returns to scale, workers invest more for the depth of their human
 capital, and less for the breadth, as the size of the labor market
 increases. Also, the larger the size of the market, the more varieties of
 job requirements are used so that the average match between a worker and a
 firm improves.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Real Wages, Employment, and the Phillips Curve. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 706-20
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A recent study by Mark J. Bils (1985) found real wages to be procyclical,
 contradicting previous findings by Patrick T. Geary and John Kennan
 (1982), who found no consistent relationship, and Salih N. Neftci (1978),
 who found countercyclical movements in real wages. These studies differed
 in both methodology and sample period. In this study, the authors find
 that real wages are either procyclical or countercyclical depending on the
 sample period chosen. Employment changes generated by aggregate supply
 shocks are associated with procyclical real wage movements, while during
 years dominated by shifts in aggregate demand, real wages are highly
 countercyclical.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Imitation, Entrepreneurship, and Long-run Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 721-39
Issue: 3
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Despite the widespread belief that entrepreneurship is a key factor in
 economic development, there have been few attempts to develop formal
 models to analyze the phenomenon. This paper presents a model in which
 endogenous entrepreneurial activity is a key determinant of economic
 growth. The theory also differs from standard models in that growth is
 driven by the imitative activities of entrepreneurs. Previous theories
 have focused on the direct production of knowledge, underemphasizing the
 importance of imitation in the growth process. The paper also examines
 external effects arising from these entrepreneurial activities--effects
 distinct from those studied by Paul Romer.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
