Title:   The Incidence and Efficiency Costs of Corporate Taxation When Corporate and Noncorporate Firms Produce the Same Good. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 749-80
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  One difficulty confronting Arnold C. Harberger's celebrated model of the
 corporate income tax is how to treat noncorporate production in primarily
 corporate sectors and corporate production in primarily noncorporate
 sectors. This paper presents a two-good model with corporate and
 noncorporate production of both goods. The incidence of corporate tax in
 the authors' mutual production model can differ markedly from that in the
 Harberger model. The difference between the two models in deadweight loss
 is also striking, with losses in the mutual production model many times
 larger than those in the Harberger model.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Impact of China's Economic Reforms on Agricultural Productivity Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 781-807
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a method for assessing the relative importance of
 price increases and strengthened individual incentives due to the
 introduction of the responsibility system for the post-1978 increase in
 China's agricultural productivity. Data on post-1978 Chinese agricultural
 performance suggest that a little over three-quarters of the measured
 productivity increase is due to payment system changes and the remainder
 to price increases. The authors also use their method to calculate
 incentive indices, giving an estimate of the fraction of their marginal
 product that peasants received under the pre-1978 regime.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Estimated Model of Entrepreneurial Choice under Liquidity Constraints. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 808-27
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Is the capitalist function distinct from the entrepreneurial function in
 modern economies? Or does a person have to be wealthy before he or she can
 start a business? Frank H.  Knight and Joseph A.  Schumpeter held
 different views on the answer to this question. The authors' empirical
 findings side with Knight: liquidity constraints bind, and a would-be
 entrepreneur must bear most of the risk inherent in his venture. The
 reasoning is roughly this: the data show that wealthier people are more
 inclined to become entrepreneurs. In principle, this could be so because
 the wealthy tend to make better entrepreneurs, but the data reject this
 explanation. Instead, the data point to liquidity constraints: capital is
 essential for starting a business, and liquidity constraints tend to
 exclude those with insufficient funds at their disposal.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Reputation Acquisition in Debt Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 828-62
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper studies reputation formation and the evolution over time of
 the incentive effects of reputation to mitigate conflicts of interest
 between borrowers and lenders. Borrowers use the proceeds of their loans
 to fund projects. In the absence of reputation effects, borrowers have
 incentives to select excessively risky projects. If there is sufficient
 adverse selection, reputation will not initially provide improved
 incentives to borrowers with short credit histories. Over time, if a good
 reputation is acquired, reputation will provide improved incentives.
 General characteristics of markets in which reputation takes time to work
 are identified.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Precautionary Saving and the Timing of Taxes. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 863-79
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the effects of government debt and income taxes on
 consumption and saving in a world of infinitely-lived households having
 uncertain and heterogeneous incomes. The special structure of the model
 allows exact aggregation across households despite incomplete markets. The
 effects of government debt are shown to be substantial, roughly comparable
 to those resulting from finite horizons, and crucially dependent on the
 length of time until the debt is repaid. Also, anticipated changes in
 taxes are shown to cause anticipated changes in consumption. Finally, an
 index of fiscal stance is derived.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Dynamics of R&D and Investment in the Scientific Sector. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 880-904
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper empirically explores the dynamic interactions among research
 and development, capital investment, and the stock market performance of
 191 firms in science-based industries during the period 1973-81. Using a
 framework based on dynamic factor analysis, the authors test asymmetric
 specifications of the dynamics between R&D and investment. The data
 indicate that R&D Granger-causes investment, but that investment does not
 Granger-cause R&D. The authors discuss interpretations of this causal
 ordering, characterize the stylized facts of the movements over time of
 R&D and investment, and measure the stock market valuation of these
 movements.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Consumption Smoothing, Migration, and Marriage: Evidence from Rural India. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 905-26
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  A significant proportion of migration in low-income countries,
 particularly in rural areas, is composed of moves by women for the purpose
 of marriage. The authors seek to explain these mobility patterns based on
 a framework in which the marriage of daughters to locationally distant,
 dispersed yet kinship-related households is a manifestation of implicit
 interhousehold contractual arrangements aimed at mitigating income risks
 and facilitating consumption smoothing in an environment characterized by
 information costs and spatially covariant risks. Analyses of longitudinal
 data on consumption patterns, income, and marital arrangements in South
 Indian households lend support to the theory.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   On Money as a Medium of Exchange. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 927-54
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze economies in which individuals specialize in
 consumption and production and meet randomly over time in a way that
 implies that trade must be bilateral and quid pro quo. Nash equilibria in
 trading strategies are characterized. Certain goods emerge endogenously as
 media of exchange, or commodity money, depending both on their intrinsic
 properties and on extrinsic beliefs. There are also equilibria with
 genuine fiat currency circulating as the general medium of exchange. The
 authors find that equilibria are not generally Pareto optimal and that
 introducing fiat currency into a commodity money economy may unambiguously
 improve welfare. Velocity, acceptability, and liquidity are discussed.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Currency Substitution, Foreign Inflation, and Terms-of-Trade Dynamics. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 955-64
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper incorporates rational expectations, full price flexibility,
 and currency substitution into the usual small-economy model, taking
 explicit account of inflation abroad. Not only will the steady-state terms
 of trade be affected by an increase in the rate of monetary expansion when
 the inflation rate abroad is assumed to be nonzero, but its dynamic path
 may also be different from the usual case in which inflation abroad is
 ignored. It has been shown that if the import demands are relatively
 inelastic, the terms of trade will undershoot their equilibrium value; if
 the import demands are elastic, the terms of trade will overshoot. The key
 to these diametrically opposite results is the degree of ultimate
 deterioration in the terms of trade.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Are Sunspots Necessary? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 965-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the author shows the existence of stationary rational
 expectations equilibria in a simple, two-island, overlapping-generations
 model of the type first considered by Robert E. Lucas, Jr., in which all
 uncertainty is endogenous. The result is obtained by first constructing
 "sunspot" equilibria on each island separately and then using the
 equilibrium pricing equations to eliminate the sunspot variable. In the
 resulting equilibrium, each island's prices serve as the sunspot for the
 other island. The constructed equilibrium is nontrivially stochastic.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Bioeconomics and the Bowhead Whale. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 974-87
Issue: 4
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In the mid-1970s, the International Whaling Commission concluded that the
 increased harvest by Alaskan Eskimos threatened the existence of the
 bowhead whale, which was slowly recovering from a period of open-access
 exploitation (1848-1914). This paper briefly discusses the economic
 history of the bowhead whale fishery in the western Arctic, simulates the
 population from 1848-1988, and presents a bioeconomic model that may be
 used to determine optimal Eskimo harvest for alternative rates of discount
 and weights on the bowhead population.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
