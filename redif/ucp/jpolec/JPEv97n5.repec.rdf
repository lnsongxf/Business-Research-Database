Title:   Industrialization and the Big Push. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1003-26
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper explores Paul N. Rosenstein-Rodan's idea that simultaneous
 industrialization of many sectors of the economy can be profitable for
 them all even when no sector can break even industrializing alone. The
 authors analyze this idea in the context of an imperfectly-competitive
 economy with aggregate demand spillovers, and interpret the big push into
 industrialization as a move from a bad to a good equilibrium. They present
 three mechanisms for generating a big push and discuss their relevance for
 less-developed countries.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Employer Size-Wage Effect. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1027-59
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors consider six explanations for the positive relationship
 between employer size and wages: large employers (1) hire higher-quality
 workers, (2) offer inferior working conditions, (3) make more use of high
 wages to forestall unionization, (4) have more ability to pay high wages,
 (5) face smaller pools of applicants relative to vacancies, and (6) are
 less able to monitor their workers. They find some support for the first
 of these, but there remains a significant wage premium for those working
 for large employers.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Simple Economics of Optimal Auctions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1060-90
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors show that the seller's problem in devising an optimal auction
 is virtually identical to the monopolist's problem in third-degree price
 discrimination. More generally, many of the important results and elegant
 techniques developed in the field of mechanism design can be reinterpreted
 in the language of standard microtheory. They illustrate this by
 considering the problem of bilateral exchange with privately-known values.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Forecasting Incentives. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1091-1112
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  An agent of unknown expertise is requested to forecast the mean of an
 uncertain outcome. The agent can refine forecasts at a constant marginal
 cost per unit precision, but neither cost nor precision can be verified by
 the planner. The problem is to induce both truthful revelation and an
 appropriate degree of learning so as to minimize the expected sum of
 direct planning losses and agent payments. Optimal contracts are derived
 with and without self-screening of expertise and with and without
 competition between agents. Self-screening tends to be much less valuable
 than competition.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Transportation, State Marketing, and the Taxation of the Agricultural Hinterland. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1113-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  In raising revenues, governments of poor countries affect farm gate
 prices for export crops. Because agriculture is dispersed, interventions
 have spatial effects, leading to an integrated analysis of taxation,
 marketing, and transportation. Policies to be used singly or together
 include land, export, and transportation taxes/subsidies, and variants of
 state marketing, in which only government procures crops. An export tax
 and a transport subsidy may be optimal. With state marketing, important
 aspects of buying depots are numbers, locations, spatial pattern of prices
 paid, and movement of output toward or away from the ultimate market.
 These policies also affect transport investment strategies.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Fresh Look at the Rotten Kid Theorem--and Other Household Mysteries. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1138-59
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Gary Becker's "rotten kid theorem" asserts that if all family members
 receive gifts of money income from a benevolent household member, then
 even if the household head does not precommit to an incentive plan for
 family members, it will be in the interest of selfish family members to
 maximize total family income. The author shows by examples that the rotten
 kid theorem is not true without assuming transferable utility. He finds a
 simple condition on utility functions that is necessary and sufficient for
 there to be the kind of transferable utility needed for a rotten kid
 theorem. While restrictive, these conditions still allow one to apply the
 strong conclusions of the rotten kid theorem in an interesting class of
 examples.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Collusion in Ocean Shipping: A Test of Monopoly and Empty Core Model s. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1160-79
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  In markets with avoidable fixed costs, the core may be empty. The author
 argues that a reason for collusion is to impose an equilibrium where none
 exists. He sets up a framework for deriving testable implications from the
 model and compares those implications with those of a cartel model. The
 author compares the two models empirically with data from liner shipping
 conferences, legal collusive agreements that have been in force for over a
 century, and concludes that the evidence supports the theory of the core.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Trade in Producer Services: A Heckscher-Ohlin Approach. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1180-96
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Trade in services has become topical, but little theory has been
 developed. This paper assumes that one commodity and the services of
 capital are tradable and examines the traditional trade results. Service
 trade can produce the same equilibrium as commodity trade, but substantial
 differences exist depending on whether the tradable commodity is capital
 or labor intensive. Tariffs on either commodity have the same commodity
 price effects and will always increase the welfare of the immobile factor
 labor. Factor income taxes can also affect trade patterns. When both goods
 and capital services are tradable, there is an indeterminacy in trade
 patterns, and tariffs, while reducing commodity trade, may not reduce
 welfare.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Accurate Measurement of the Crowd-Out Effect, Income Effect, and Price Effect for Charitable Contributions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1197-1207
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  In the past, empirical research on charitable contributions has focused
 on two issues: estimating the income and price elasticities of
 contributions and estimating the extent to which government funding
 crowded out private contributions. The two fundamental problems in all
 these studies are the differences in the underlying conceptual models and
 the use of imperfect data for empirical analysis. This paper addresses
 both of these problems.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Importance of Local Fiscal Conditions in Analyzing Local Labor Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1208-31
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  A new test of the compensating wage differential model is proposed. The
 logic behind Jennifer Roback's model, which shows how differences in
 nonproduced amenities may be reflected in intercity wage differentials, is
 extended to the case of differences in local fiscal conditions,
 represented by tax rates and publicly produced services. Results show that
 differences in local tax rates and services provisions do generate
 compensating wage differentials across cities. The effects of a
 particularly large set of taxes and effective services output measures are
 examined. Differences in local fiscal conditions are shown to play
 important roles in explaining the variance in intermetropolitan wages.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Curse of Knowledge in Economic Settings: An Experimental Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1232-54
Issue: 5
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  In economic analyses of asymmetric information, better-informed agents
 are assumed capable of reproducing the judgments of less-informed agents.
 The authors discuss a systematic violation of this assumption that they
 call the "curse of knowledge." Better-informed agents are unable to ignore
 private information even when it is in their interest to do so; more
 information is not always better. Comparing judgments made in
 individual-level and market experiments, they find that market forces
 reduce the curse by approximately 50 percent, but do not eliminate it.
 Implications for bargaining, strategic behavior by firms, principal-agent
 problems, and choice under uncertainty are discussed.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
