Title:   Product Development and International Trade. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1261-83
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a multicountry, dynamic general equilibrium model of
 product innovation and international trade to study the creation of
 comparative advantage through R$50D and the evolution of world trade over
 time. In their model, firms must incur resource costs to introduce new
 products, and forward-looking potential producers conduct R$50D and enter
 the product market whenever profit opportunities exist. Trade has both
 intraindustry and interindustry components, and the different incentives
 that face agents in different countries for investment and savings
 decisions give rise to intertemporal trade. The authors derive results on
 the dynamics of trade patterns and trade volume and on the temporal
 emergence of multinational corporations.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Profit Regulation of Defense Contractors and Prizes for Innovation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1284-1305
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper argues that regulatory institutions in defense procurement are
 (and necessarily must be) organized to create prizes for innovation in the
 form of positive economic profit on production contracts. This has a
 number of important policy implications. The values of the prizes on
 twelve major aerospace projects are estimated using stock-market data and
 are shown to be large.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Convergence of Least-Squares Learning in Environments with Hidden State Variables and Private Information. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1306-22
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors study the convergence of recursive least-squares learning
 schemes in economic environments in which there is private information.
 The presence of private information leads to the presence of hidden state
 variables from the viewpoint of particular agents. By applying theorems of
 Lennart Ljung, the authors extend some of their earlier results to
 characterize conditions under which a system governed by least-squares
 learning will eventually converge to a rational expectations equilibrium.
 They apply insights from the learning results to formulate and compute the
 equilibrium of a version of Robert Townsend's model.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Currency and Credit in a Private Information Economy. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1323-44
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In an environment with private information, spatial separation, and
 limited communication, a currency-like object and more standard named
 credits can be distinguished. The credit objects can be used among agents
 in an enduring relationship, that is, among agents with known trading
 histories, whereas the currency-like object must be used among relative
 strangers. In this environment, collectively determined Pareto-optimal
 rules make the level of the currency-like object and the mix of currency
 to named credits responsive to individual needs and to economy-wide
 states. Total indebtedness is determined by the number of lenders, that
 is, by preference or demand shocks, and the mix of currency to credits is
 determined by transaction patterns among the agents.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Optimal Contracts under Costly State Falsification. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1345-63
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  We examine an exchange economy with two agents: one risk neutral with a
 certain endowment and a second risk averse with a random endowment. The
 realization of the endowment is public but can be falsified by the second
 agent at a cost. For a broad class of falsification cost functions the
 optimal no-falsification contract is noncontingent on a left-hand interval
 and strictly increasing with a slope strictly less than one on a
 right-hand interval. Under a mild further restriction, optimal
 no-falsification contracts are, in addition, piecewise linear. Optimal
 contracts may in general require falsifying the state, but for a set of
 the highest endowment realizations there is no falsification. We find
 simple conditions under which the optimal contract is a i no-falsification
 contract.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Cost of Business Cycles with Indivisibilities and Liquidity Constraints. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1364-83
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  It is almost universally agreed that individuals face incomplete
 insurance markets and cannot perfectly insure against the idiosyncratic
 risk. In this paper, simple general equilibrium models with incomplete
 insurance markets are examined in order to assess the impact of imperfect
 insurance on the magnitude of the welfare costs of business cycles. Two
 versions of incomplete insurance markets are considered, and certain
 statistical properties of the equilibrium stochastic processes in these
 environments are compared with those of a perfect insurance economy.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rationing and Rent Dissipation in the Presence of Heterogeneous Individuals. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1384-94
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper discusses the implications of rationing by waiting when
 consumers have different time costs and personal valuation. The joint
 distribution function of time costs and personal valuations is used to
 characterize market equilibrium. It is argued that, under certain
 conditions, an increase in the variance of time costs will reduce the
 dissipation of rent. Furthermore, it is shown that introducing a secondary
 market for a rationed good does not necessarily improve welfare because
 total surplus under rationing by waiting depends more on the variance than
 on the level of time costs and personal valuation. The model is also used
 to discuss other institutions that involve rent-seeking activities, such
 as the patent system and import quotas.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Abstract:
  By applying the standard tools of microeconomic analysis, the author
 argues that democratic markets work as well as economic markets. In
 particular, he shows that previous work has greatly exaggerated the
 existence of principal-agent and informational problems in electoral

Abstract:
  The authors modify R. A. Fisher's model by incorporating measures on the
 environment that may be correlated across kin groups. They estimate a
 model of schooling attainment using data on eight kin groups and find a
 large contribution of generic endowments to the variance in schooling,
 though certain aspects of the environment matter.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1447-58
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Models of giving have often been based on altruism. Examples include
 charity and intergenerational transfers. The literatures on both subjects
 have centered around neutrality hypotheses: charity is subject to complete
 crowding out, while intergenerational transfers are subject to Ricardian
 equivalence. This paper formally develops a model of giving in which
 altruism is not "pure." In particular, people are assumed to get a "warm
 glow" from giving. Contrary to the previous literature, this model
 generates identifiable comparative statics results that show that crowding
 out of charity is incomplete and that government debt will have Keynesian
 effects.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Durable-Goods Monopoly with Discrete Demand. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1459-78
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze a dynamic game between consumers and the sole seller
 of a durable good. Unlike previous analyses, they assume that there exists
 a finite collection of buyers rather than a continuum. None of the main
 conclusions of the literature on durable-goods monopoly survives this
 change in assumption. Coase's conjecture that a durable-goods monopolist
 cannot earn supracompetitive profits in the continuous-time limit, Bulow's
 proposition that renting a durable is always more profitable than selling
 it, and Stokey's proposition that precommitting to a time path of prices
 is always optimal are all false when the set of buyers is finite.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Unemployment Insurance and Short-Time Compensation: The Effects on Layoffs, Hours per Worker, and Wages. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1479-96
Issue: 6
Volume: 97
Year: 1989
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze two unemployment insurance systems. In one,
 unemployed workers receive benefits, while those on reduced hours do not,
 as in North America (at least until recently). In the other, short-time
 compensation is paid to workers on reduced hours, as in Europe. The first
 system causes inefficient temporary layoffs for some parameters; the
 latter does not, but implies inefficient hours per worker. Some evidence
 is presented regarding these effects. Despite policymakers' recent
 enthusiasm for short-time compensation, the clear implication of this
 project is that changes should come on the tax, not the benefit, side of
 the system.  Copyright 1989 by University of Chicago Press.
