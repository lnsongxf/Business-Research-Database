Title:   Economic Exchange during Hyperinflation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-27
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors construct a theoretical model of hyperinflation that focuses
 on individuals and their process of economic exchange. In their model,
 buyers must carry cash while shopping, and some transactions take place in
 a decentralized setting in which buyer and seller negotiate over the terms
 of trade of an indivisible good. Since buyers face the constant threat of
 incoming younger (hence richer) customers, their bargaining position is
 weakened by inflation, allowing sellers to extract a higher real price.
 However, they show that higher inflation also reduces buyers' search,
 increasing sellers' wait for customers. As a result, the volume of
 transactions concluded in the decentralized sector falls. At high enough
 rates of inflation, all agents suffer a welfare loss.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Equilibrium and Inefficiency in a Community Model with Peer Group Effects. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 110-33
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Public-service output depends on input expenditures, on own personal
 characteristics, and on the characteristics of the other residents in the
 community (the peer group effect). In a community model with public
 expenditures set by voting, with migration between communities, and with
 land price differentials (capitalization), it is shown that communities
 may become heterogeneous in composition and (second-best) inefficient.
 This equilibrium occurs when the peer group effect is neither "too strong"
 nor "too weak." The inefficiency arises because an externality is created
 by migration. The land price differential does not play the part of the
 "price" of the better peer group, but of a transfer payment.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Implementation Process of Comparable Worth: Winners and Losers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 134-52
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper provides a unique opportunity to observe how a public policy
 affected the earnings of various interest groups at different stages of
 implementation. Specifically, the authors examine how the earnings of
 women, union members, and supervisory and professional staff were affected
 by various proposed and implemented comparable-worth pay plans in Iowa.
 They find that large relative gains to women in the original proposed
 plans were reduced as the process evolved. As a result, some of the
 original gains to women were redistributed to union members, supervisors,
 and professionals.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Rational Nonpurchase of Long-term-Care Insurance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 153-68
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  Only a tiny fraction of the nonpoor population currently purchases
 private insurance coverage against long-term-care costs. Studies generally
 attribute the failure to purchase private coverage to "unawareness" by
 potential purchasers of the benefits of coverage and a misperception that
 Medicare currently covers long-term care. The author explores alternative
 reasons for failure to purchase coverage by well-informed, expected
 utility-maximizing, risk-averse individuals for whom long-term care is
 associated with a large increase in mortality and for whom family members
 represent an alternative source of care. There may be no demand for
 long-term-care insurance, even if it is made available at actuarially fair
 premiums, because the main consequence of coverage is to enhance the
 expected value of one's estate.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Career Mobility. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 169-92
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the role and
 significance of occupational mobility in the labor market, focusing on
 individuals' careers. It provides additional dimensions to the analysis of
 investment in human capital; wage differences across individuals; and the
 relationships among promotions, quits, and interfirm occupational
 mobility. It is shown that part of the returns to education is in the form
 of higher probabilities of occupational upgrading, within or across firms.
 Given an origin occupation, schooling increases the likelihood of
 occupational upgrading. Furthermore, workers who are not promoted, despite
 a high probability of promotion, are more likely to quit.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Tax Changes and Phase Diagrams for an Overlapping Generations Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 193-220
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The literature evaluating tax changes within an intertemporal general
 equilibrium framework subdivides into representative agent and overlapping
 generations formulations. Papers in the former class have developed
 techniques analogous to those routine for static analyses. The author
 shows that the same general approach works for the overlapping generations
 model. The context is the system from Alan Auerbach and Laurence
 Kotlikoff's Dynamic Fiscal Policy (1987). The proposed methodology allows
 one to examine stability and determinancy issues for the model, deals
 precisely with small policy changes, and can easily handle bundles of
 changes. The author presents comparative static results for comparison
 with existing work.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Incidence of Sanctions against Employers of Illegal Aliens. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 28-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This article assesses the significance of sanctions against employers of
 illegal aliens for resource allocation and income distribution in the
 United States. Data from the 1980 Census of Population are used to
 identify the industries likely to be monitored most closely by the
 immigration authorities. A general equilibrium incidence analysis is then
 carried out using alternative assumptions about the overall level of
 enforcement. Estimates are made of the effects sanctions will have on the
 real wages of legal U.S. workers.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Occupational Matching: A Test of Sorts. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 45-69
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a theory of job matching in which matching
 information has both job-specific and occupation-specific components. If
 occupational matching is significant, then the theory predicts that, for
 those who have switched jobs but remained in the same occupation,
 increased tenure in the previous job lowers the likelihood of separation
 from the current job. These predictions are tested using job tenure data
 from the National Longitudinal Survey's youth cohort. In general, the data
 are consistent with the occupational matching hypothesis.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Efficient Market Hypothesis and Insider Trading on the Stock Market. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 70-93
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors study behavior of a large trader with private information
 about the mean of an asset with a risky return. They argue that if the
 variability of the return is not too great, typically the trader will find
 it desirable to ensure that the market price does not reveal his
 information, that is, that a "pooling" equilibrium arises. Such an
 equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that
 arise in "separating" equilibria, where information can be inferred from
 prices. Thus, the efficient market hypothesis may well fail if there is
 imperfect competition. Despite the uninformativeness of prices, the other
 (competitive) traders are also better off in the pooling equilibrium than
 in any separating equilibrium, again if one assumes variability.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Why Are Vickrey Auctions Rare? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 94-109
Issue: 1
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  In 1961, William Vickrey showed that, in an independent private-values
 context with symmetric risk-neutral bidders, sealed second-price auctions
 have dominant truth-revealing equilibrium strategies; are perfectly
 efficient economically; and produce the same expected revenue for bid
 takers as equilibrium strategies in oral progressive auctions, Dutch
 auctions, or standard, first-price sealed bidding. Yet sealed second-price
 auctions seldom occur. The authors argue that fear of cheating and
 especially disincentives for bidders to follow truth-revealing strategies
 are important explanations. They model auctions in which third parties
 capture a fraction of the economic rent revealed by the second-price
 procedure.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
