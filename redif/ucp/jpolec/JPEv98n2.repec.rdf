Title:   Performance Pay and Top-Management Incentives. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 225-64
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors' estimates of the pay-performance relation (including pay,
 options, stockholding, and dismissal) for chief executive officers
 indicate that CEO wealth changes $3.25 for every $1,000 changes in
 shareholder wealth. Although the incentives generated by stock ownership
 are large relative to pay and dismissal incentives, most CEOs hold trivial
 fractions of the firms' stock, and ownership levels have declined over the
 past fifty years. The authors hypothesize that public and private
 political forces impose constraints that reduce the pay-performance
 sensitivity. Declines in both the pay-performance relation and the level
 of CEO pay since the 1930s are consistent with this hypothesis.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Theory of Entrepreneurship and Its Application to the Study of Business Transfers. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 265-94
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors formalize a view of entrepreneurship in the spirit of
 Theordore W. Schultz. In this view, entrepreneurs are those individuals
 who respond to the opportunities for creating new products (and the like)
 that arise because of technological progress, for example. The theory has
 implications for entry and exit, specialization of labor, and business
 transfers. These business transfers correspond to, among other things,
 individuals changing jobs and sales of firms. Transfers are seen as a
 mechanism facilitating division of labor. The authors also discuss
 evidence on business transfers that occur through sales of firms.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Share Tendering Strategies and the Success of Hostile Takeover Bids. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 295-324
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a model of tender offers in which the bid perfectly
 reveals the bidder's private information about the size of the value
 improvement that can be generated by a takeover. The authors argue that
 bidders with greater improvements will offer higher premia to ensure that
 sufficient shares are tendered to obtain control. The model relates
 announcement date returns and takeover success or failure to the amount
 bid, the initial shareholdings of the bidder, the number of shares the
 bidder attempts to purchase, the dilution of minority shareholders, and
 managerial opposition. They show that managerial defensive measures will
 sometimes increase the probability of the offer's success.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Factor Market Search and the Structure of Simple General Equilibrium Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 325-55
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper presents a simple general equilibrium model in which
 unemployed workers search for jobs and vacant firms search for employees.
 Formally, the author develops a two-sector, constrained efficient version
 of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides matching model of trade coordination.
 This approach to modeling factor market search appears promising since its
 algebraic development parallels Ronald W. Jones's treatment of the
 two-sector model of production, and the latter framework underlies most
 applied general equilibrium analyses. Some illustrative short-run and
 steady-state results are presented concerning the behavior of open and
 closed economies that exhibit unemployment and vacancies.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Unemployment, the Market for Interviews, and Wage Employment. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 356-71
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  A model of equilibrium unemployment and vacancies is presented in which
 the absence of a market for interviews can yield externalities and
 inefficiency. Inefficiency results in market forces that lead firms to
 charge fees for interviews or to change the wage rate. These market forces
 require substantial information and may not operate. A graphical analysis
 shows how such forces would cause wages to adjust to shifts in supply,
 taxes, and transfers between workers and firms. With excessive
 unemployment, efficiency requires a transfer of income from workers to
 firms.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Do Bad Bidders Become Good Targets? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 372-98
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper empirically examines one motive for takeovers: to change
 control of firms that make acquisitions that diminish the value of their
 equity. Firms that subsequently become takeover targets make acquisitions
 that significantly reduce their equity value, and firms that do not become
 takeover targets make acquisitions that raise their equity value. Within
 the sample of acquisitions by targets, the acquisitions that reduce equity
 value the most are those that are later divested either in bust-up
 takeovers or restructuring programs to thwart the takeover. This evidence
 is consistent with theories advanced by Robin Marris (1963), Henry G. 
 Manne (1965), and Michael C. Jensen (1986) concerning the disciplinary
 role played by takeovers.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Two-Sex Demographic Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 399-420
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Classical stable population theory, the standard model of population age
 structure and growth, is ill suited to addressing many issues that concern
 economists and demographers because it is a "one-sex" theory. This paper
 investigates the existence, uniqueness, and dynamic stability of
 equilibrium in the birth matrix-mating rule model, a new model of age
 structure and growth for two-sex, monogamously mating, populations. The
 paper shows, by means of examples, that the birth matrix-mating rule model
 can have multiple nontrivial equilibria and establishes sufficient
 conditions for uniqueness. It generalizes a theorem of W. Brian Arthur to
 nonlinear systems and uses it to establish sufficient conditions for local
 dynamic stability.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Alternative Common-Value Auction Procedures: Revenue Comparisons with Free Entry. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 421-29
Issue: 2
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The logic of revenue comparisons for different types of common-value
 auctions is substantially altered if the number of participants, rather
 than being fixed, responds endogenously to the expected profitability from
 participating. In a thoroughly symmetric model, a seller may prefer that
 competition be indirect: an auction procedure in which fewer participants
 are needed to drive the expected profitability from participating down to
 the level obtainable in other auctions in the economy can attain higher
 expected revenue if a sale is sufficiently likely. This insight allows a
 complete, revenue ranking of standard auction procedures, with endogenous
 entry.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
