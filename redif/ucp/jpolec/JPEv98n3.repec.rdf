Title:   Permanent and Transitory Movements in Labor Income: An Explanation for "Excess Smoothness" in Consumption. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 449-75
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Many have argued that, if labor income is difference stationary, the
 permanent income hypothesis predicts that consumption should be relatively
 volatile. In U.S. aggregate data, labor income is well characterized as
 having a unit root; however, consumption turns out to be relatively
 smooth. This anomaly is known as Deaton's paradox. The author resolves
 this paradox by providing decompositions of labor income into permanent
 and transitory components. They preserve the univariate dynamic properties
 of labor income. However, when agents distinguish permanent and transitory
 movements in their labor income, the permanent income hypothesis correctly
 predicts the observed smoothness in consumption.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Advertising and Entry: The Case of Physician Services. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 476-500
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the entry implications of physician advertising.
 Evidence suggests that advertising inhibited entry into this market.
 Nevertheless, experienced physicians (incumbents), to whom advertising
 would offer the greatest financial benefit, in fact advertise less--a
 paradox that may be explained by nonfinancial concerns, such as
 unwillingness to break well-internalized professional norms against
 advertising. Physician advertising has risen sharply in recent years and
 it appears that this trend will continue. If incumbents increasingly
 resort to advertising, there could be substantial redistribution of income
 from less-well-established physicians to better-established ones.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   International Evidence on the Size of the Random Walk in Output. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 501-18
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper contributes three extensions of John H. Cochrane's work on
 measuring the relative stability of long-term growth. It estimates
 variance ratios for nine OECD countries over the period 1871-1985,
 presents an improved approximation to the distribution of the variance
 ratio, and considers the comovements of long growth cycles across
 countries. The evidence indicates that the relative stability of long-term
 growth found by Cochrane is unique to the United States. Relative to the
 United States, most countries have more variable dynamics at low
 frequencies and smoother dynamics at frequencies traditionally associated
 with business cycles.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Habit Formation: A Resolution of the Equity Premium Puzzle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 519-43
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The equity premium puzzle, identified by Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. 
 Prescott, states that, for plausible values of the risk aversion
 coefficient, the difference of the expected rate of return on the stock
 market and the riskless rate of interest is too large, given the observed
 small variance of the growth rate in per capita consumption. The puzzle is
 resolved in the context of an economy with rational expectations once the
 time separability of von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences is relaxed to
 allow for adjacent complementarity in consumption, a property known as
 habit persistence. Essentially, habit persistence drives a wedge between
 the relative risk aversion of the representative agent and the
 intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Compensation and Productive Efficiency of Partnerships: Evidence from Medical Group Practice. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 544-73
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors develop and test a model of the effect of
 alternative compensation arrangements on productive efficiency in medical
 group practices. The technique employed is maximum likelihood production
 frontier estimation. The authors provide a simple behavioral model of the
 determination of productive efficiency and a new interpretation of the
 economic measure of technical efficiency. They derive a "behavioral
 production function" that relates production to individual responses to
 incentives, and they indicate that the impossibility of recovering the
 parameters of the production technology from observed behavior. Overall,
 the empirical results indicate that incentives do affect productivity.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Liability and Large-Scale, Long-term Hazards. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 574-95
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes the application of liability to large-scale,
 long-term hazards. The key features distinguishing such hazards are the
 long temporal separation between exposure to a hazard and disease, and the
 large damages when injuries finally emerge. The large scale of damages
 creates a strong incentive to avoid liability payments and the long
 temporal separation creates numerous avenues through which parties can
 avoid paying possible damage awards. The analysis focuses on the incentive
 to avoid paying damages by vertically divesting production tasks
 associated with serious occupations risks. The paper then presents an
 empirical regression analysis of small-firm entry into the U.S. economy
 between 1967 and 1980.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Nonparametric Investigation of Duration Dependence in the American Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 596-616
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Does the termination probability of a business expansion or contraction
 increase with age? This question may be formally addressed by analyzing
 the nature of duration dependence in aggregate economic activity. The
 author's null hypothesis is that there is no duration dependence, which
 they test via intentionally nonparametric procedures. They also argue that
 a common notion of business cycle periodicity can be usefully interpreted
 in terms of whole-cycle duration dependence. The authors find some
 evidence for duration dependence in whole cycles and in prewar expansions,
 but little evidence elsewhere.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   International Coordination of Fiscal Policy in Limiting Economies. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 617-36
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors examine the limiting behavior of cooperative and
 noncooperative fiscal policies as countries' market power goes to zero.
 They show that these policies converge if countries raise revenues through
 lump-sum taxation. However, if there are unremovable domestic distortions,
 such as distorting taxes, there can be gains to coordination even when a
 single country's policy cannot affect world prices. These results differ
 from the received wisdom in the optimal tariff literature. The key
 distinction is that, contrary to the tariff literature, the spending
 decisions of governments are explicitly modeled.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Job Search Outcomes for the Employed and Unemployed. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 637-55
Issue: 3
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper examines how four components of the job search process
 influence the job-finding rate. A reduced-form model of job search is
 estimated that takes account of the fact that users of a particular method
 of job search are not a random subset of all searchers. The empirical
 analysis focuses on differences in search behavior between the employed
 and unemployed. A key finding of the analysis is that the offer rate per
 contact is greater for employed searchers than for unemployed searchers.
 This may be due to differences in the effectiveness of search while
 employed versus unemployed or to unobserved differences in search effort.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
