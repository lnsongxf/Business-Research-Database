Title:   Fundamental Stocks of Knowledge and Productivity Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 673-702
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper develops new indicators of accumulated academic science and
 tests their explanatory power on productivity data from manufacturing
 industries. Knowledge is found to be a major contributor to productivity
 growth. Furthermore, a lag in effect of roughly 20 years is found between
 the appearance of research in the academic cmmunity and its effect on
 productivity in the form of knowledge absorbed by an industry. Academic
 technology and academic science filtered through interindustry spillovers
 exhibit lags of roughly 10 and 30 years each. Thus implied search and
 gestation times far exceed developmental periods in the studies of R&D. A
 clear implication is that basic research declines relative to development
 in the face of an exogenous rise in the real rate of interest.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Noise Trader Risk in Financial Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 703-38
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors present a simple overlapping generations model of an asset
 market in which irrational noise traders with erroneous stochastic beliefs
 both affect prices and earn higher expected returns. The unpredictability
 of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that
 deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a
 result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in
 the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate
 amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a
 higher expected return than rational investors do. The model sheds light
 on a number of financial anomalies.   Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The "Wizard of Oz" as a Monetary Allegory. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 739-60
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, perhaps America's favorite children's story,
 is also an informed comment on the battle over free silver in the 1890s.
 The characters in the story represent real figures, such as William
 Jennings Bryan. This paper interprets the allegory of economists and
 economic historians, illuminating a number of elements left unexplained by
 critics concerned with the politics of the allegory. It also reexamines
 Bryan and the case for free silver. Far from being monetary cranks, the
 advocates of free silver had a strong argument on both theoretical and
 empirical grounds.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Model of the Demand for Longevity and the Value of Life Extension. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 761-82
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  We specify a demand function for longevity, or quantity of life, along
 with corresponding demand functions for indicators of quality of life and
 a value-of-health and life extension functions. We show that the demand
 for health must be derived in conjunction with that for longevity and the
 related consumption plan, and that all choices depend on initial
 individual endowments and terminal conditions. Our comparative dynamics
 predictions indicate that optimal health and longevity are increasing
 functions of endowed wealth rather than, necessarily, current income; that
 improvements in opportunities to produce health can accentuate the
 differences between endowed health and attained longevity levels; and that
 the value individuals ascribe to their health may be increasing over a
 good portion of their life cycle.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sustainable Plans. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 783-802
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors propose a definition of time-consistent policy for
 infinite-horizon economies with competitive private agents. Allocations
 and policies are defined as functions of the history of past policies. A
 sustainable equilibrium is a sequence of history-contingent policies and
 allocations that satisfy certain sequential optimality conditions for the
 government and for private agents. The authors provide a complete
 characterization of the sustainable equilibrium outcomes for a variant of
 Stanley Fischer's model of capital taxation. They also relate their work
 to recent developments in the theory of repeated games.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Decentralization, Duplication, and Delay. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 803-26
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The authors argue that, although decentralization has advantages in
 finding low-cost solutions, these advantages are accompanied by
 coordination problems, which lead to delay or duplication of effort or
 both. Consequently, decentralization is desirable when there is little
 urgency or a great deal of private information, but it is strictly
 undesirable in urgent problems when private information is less important.
 The authors also examine the effect of large numbers and find that
 coordination problems disappear in the limit if distributions are common
 knowledge.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Estimate of a Sectoral Model of Labor Mobility. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 827-52
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a model of sectoral labor mobility and tests its main
 implications. The model nests two distinct hypotheses on the origin of
 mobility: (1) sectoral shocks and (2) worker-employer mismatch. We
 estimate the relative importance of each hypothesis and find that the bulk
 of labor mobility is caused by mismatch rather than by sectoral shift. We
 then try to put a value on society's match--specific information. That is,
 we ask to what extent the availability of the option to change jobs raises
 GNP. We find that the mobility option raises expected earnings by roughly
 between 8.5 percent and 13 percent of labor earnings, which translates to
 an increase in GNP of between 6 percent and 9 percent.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Social Cost of Environmental Quality Regulations: A General Equilibrium Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 853-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The use of cost-benefit analysis by federal regulatory agencies has
 expanded greatly in scope and sophistication. Unfortunately, agencies
 continue to employ private cost, rather than social cost, to evaluate
 environmental quality regulations. Furthermore, general equilibrium
 impacts and intertemporal effects of regulations are typically not
 included in the evaluation. In this paper, the authors estimate the social
 cost of environmental quality regulations mandated by the Clean Air Act
 and the Clean Water Act. They construct an econometric general equilibrium
 model of the United States to demonstrate that social costs estimates
 diverge sharply from private costs estimates. The authors also demonstrate
 that general equilibrium impacts are significant and pervasive.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   An Examination of Market Efficiency in British Racetrack Betting. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 874-85
Issue: 4
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The nature of the British racetrack betting market provides a distinctly
 different opportunity for testing market efficiency. On the basis of data
 from a single racing season, we compare the returns to two similar forms
 of bettings: (1) starting price bets placed with bookmakers and (2)
 pari-mutuel tote bets. Our analysis indicates that tote returns are
 consistently higher than starting price returns, even though both betting
 forms are of similar risk and the payoffs are widely reported. The
 persistently higher tote returns suggest that the British racetrack
 betting market does not satisfy the conditions of semistrong efficiency.
 Our results also provide indirect support that the market fails to meet
 the conditions for strong efficiency.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
