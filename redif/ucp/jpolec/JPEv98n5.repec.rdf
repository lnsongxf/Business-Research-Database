Title:   A Convex Model of Equilibrium Growth: Theory and Policy Implications. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1008-38
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  The authors' aim in this paper is to exposit a convex model of
 equilibrium growth. The model has two features that distinguish it from
 most other work on the subject: first, the model is convex on the
 technological side and, second, fixed factors are explicitly included.
 Existence and characterization results are provided along with some
 preliminary analyses of taxation and international trade policies. It is
 shown that the long-run growth rate in per capita consumption depends, in
 the natural way, on the parameters describing tastes, technology, and
 policies. It is demonstrated that, in a free-trade equilibrium with
 taxation, national growth rates of consumption and output need not
 converge.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Money Demand and the Stock Market in a General Equilibrium Model with Variable Velocity. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1039-53
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  A monetary model of asset pricing is used to explain observed
 correlations between money velocity and stock prices. Output shocks cause
 velocity and nominal stock prices to move in opposite directions, but may
 cause velocity and deflated stock prices to move in the same direction.
 Although monetary shocks are neutral, changes in monetary expectations
 have real effects because of their impact on the expected purchasing power
 of money balances carried into the future. Thus, changes in expected
 monetary growth alter expected real equity returns and inflation, and
 changes in monetary uncertainty alter the equity risk premium.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Compensating Differentials for Shift Work. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1054-75
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  A model analyzing the choice of shift is developed and estimated using
 data from two supplements to the Current Population Survey. The findings
 show a positive wage premium for shift work that varies with personal
 characteristics, and there is strong evidence showing the importance of
 self-selection, as workers with low potential daytime earnings are more
 likely to choose night work and supplement their earnings. The findings
 demonstrate that cross-section estimates of wage premiums for union
 membership and firm size are biased upward because they pick up some of
 the compensation differentials for shift work.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Financial Development, Growth, and the Distribution of Income. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1076-1107
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  A paradigm is presented in which both the extent of financial
 intermediation and the rate of economic growth are endogenously
 determined. Financial intermediation promotes growth because it allows a
 higher rate of return to be earned on capital, and growth in turn provides
 the means to implement costly financial structures. This financial
 intermediation and economic growth are inextricably linked in accord with
 the Goldsmith-McKinnon-Shaw view on economic development. The model also
 generates a development cycle reminiscent of the Kuznets hypotheses. In
 particular, in the transition from a primitive slow-growing economy to a
 developed fast-growing one, a nation passes through a stage in which the
 distribution of wealth across the rich and poor widens.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Entrepreneurship: Productive, Unproductive, and Destructive. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 893-921
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  The basic hypothesis is that, while the total supply of entrepreneurs
 varies among societies, the productive contribution of the society's
 entrepreneurial activities varies much more because of their allocation
 between productive activities, such as innovation, and largely
 unproductive activities, such as rent seeking or organized crime. This
 allocation is heavily influenced by the relative payoffs society offers to
 such activities. This implies that policy can influence the allocation of
 entrepreneurship more effectively than it can influence its supply.
 Historical evidence from ancient Rome, early China, and the Middle Ages
 and Renaissance in Europe is used to investigate the hypotheses.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Sleep and the Allocation of Time. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 922-43
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  Using aggregated data for twelve countries, a cross section of
 microeconomic data, and a panel of households, the authors demonstrate
 that increases in time in the labor market reduce sleep. Their theory of
 the demand for sleep differs from standard models of time use by assuming
 that sleep affects wages by affecting labor market productivity. Estimates
 of a system of demand equations demonstrate that higher wage rates reduce
 sleep time among men, but increase their waking nonmarket time by an equal
 amount. Among women the wage effect on sleep is negative by very small.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Profitability and Product Quality: Economic Determinants of Airline Safety Performance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 944-64
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  This study investigates product safety choices in the airline industry,
 with particular attention to the role of financial conditions. The
 analysis uses data on thirty-five large scheduled passenger airlines over
 the 1957-86 period to estimate the effect of profitability and other
 aspects of financial health on accident and incident rates. The results
 indicate that lower profitability is correlated with higher accident and
 incident rates, particularly for smaller carriers. These findings support
 a broad class of theoretical models that suggest links between financial
 conditions and product quality, and may have significant implications for
 the allocation of safety inspection and enforcement resources.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Economic Development and the Division of Production between Households and Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 965-82
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  A model is presented in which scale economies give market production a
 cost advantage over household production, but in which market production
 is limited by the extent of the market. The author views the production
 process as a series of stages, each further refining and specializing the
 product of the previous stage. As processing proceeds, the number of
 intermediate goods increases and markets thin out. Firms specialize in the
 early stages of production and households in the later stages. As an
 economy grows, production shifts out of households and into the market.
 Several other changes associated with economic development are also
 accounted for.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Abstract:
  This paper makes contributions to the estimation of health production
 functions and the economics of fertility control. The authors present the
 first infant health production functions that simultaneously control for
 self-selection in the resolution of pregnancies as live births or induced
 abortions and in the use of prenatal medical care services. The authors
 also incorporate the decision of a pregnant woman to give birth or to
 obtain an abortion into economic models of fertility control and use
 information conveyed by this decision to refine estimates of infant health
 production functions and demand functions for prenatal medical care.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Government Spending in a Simple Model of Endogenous Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: S103-26
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  One strand of endogenous-growth models assumes constant returns to a
 broad concept of capital. The author extends these models to include
 tax-financed government services that affect production or utility. Growth
 and saving rates fall with an increase in utility-type expenditures; the
 two rates rise initially with productive government expenditures, but
 subsequently decline. With an income tax, the decentralized choices of
 growth and saving are "too low," but if the production function is
 Cobb-Douglas, the optimizing government still satisfies a natural
 condition for productive efficiency. Empirical evidence across countries
 supports some of the hypotheses about government and growth.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Human Capital, Fertility, and Economic Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: S12-37
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  The authors' analysis of growth assumes endogenous fertility and a rising
 rate of return on human capital as the stock of human capital increases.
 When human capital is abundant, rates of return on human capital
 investments are high relative to rates of return on children, whereas,
 when human capital is scarce, rates of return on human capital are low
 relative to those on children. As a result, societies with limited human
 capital choose large families and invest little in each member; those with
 abundant human capital do the opposite. This leads to two stable steady
 states. One has large families and little human capital; the other has
 small families and perhaps growing human and physical capital.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Public Policy and Economic Growth: Developing Neoclassical Implications. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: S126-50
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  Why do the countries of the world display considerable disparity in
 long-term growth rates? This paper examines the hypothesis that the answer
 lies in differences in national public policies that affect the incentives
 that individuals have to accumulate capital in both its physical and human
 forms. The authors' analysis of a calibrated two-sector endogenous growth
 model shows that the incentive effects of taxation can induce large
 differences in long-run growth rates. This influence of taxation on the
 rate of economic growth has important welfare implications: in basic
 endogenous growth models, the welfare cost of a 10 percent increase in the
 rate of income tax can be forty times larger than in the basic
 neoclassical model.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: S151-93
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors evaluate the impact of the Tax Reform Act of
 1986 on U.S. economic growth. The authors first calculate effective tax
 rates on income from capital employed in corporate, noncorporate, and
 household sectors.They then project the future growth of the U.S. economy
 with and without the 1986 tax reform. The authors find that much of the
 potential gain in welfare was dissipated through failure to index the
 income tax base for inflation. The most promising avenue for future reform
 is to include income from household assets in the tax base, while reducing
 tax rates on business income.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  This paper presents evidence from empirical studies that test hypotheses
 derived from models of household behavior pertaining to the
 interrelationships among population growth, human capital, and economic
 development. These studies have exploited quasi-natural experiments
 embodied in the cross-area variability in the wage rates of children in a
 number of low-income countries, the intercouple variation in the
 biological propensity to conceive, and the geographically selective
 introduction of new high-yielding seed varieties in India in 1961-71. The
 evidence supports the hypothesis that alterations in the returns to human
 capital associated with exogenous technical change lead to increases in
 human capital investments and to reductions in fertility.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Endogenous Technological Change. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: S71-102
Issue: 5
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:    October 
Abstract:
  Growth in this model is driven by technological change that arises from
 intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents. The
 distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is not a
 conventional good or a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable
 good. Because of the noconvexity introduced by a nonrival good,
 price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is
 one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock
 of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human
 capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world
 markets will increase growth rates, and that a large population is not
 sufficient to generate growth.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
