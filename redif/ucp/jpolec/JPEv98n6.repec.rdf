Title:   Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1119-58
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990

Abstract:
  This paper provides a framework for addressing the question of when
 transactions should be carried out within a firm and when through the
 market. Following Grossman and Hart, we identify a firm with the assets
 that its owners control. We argue that the crucial difference for party 1
 between owning a firm (integration) and contracting for a service from
 another party 2 who owns this firm (nonintegration) is that, under
 integration, party 1 can selectively fire the workers of the firm
 (including party 2), whereas under nonintegration he can "fire" (i.e.,
 stop dealing with) only the entire firm: the combination of party 2, the
 workers, and the firm's assets. We use this idea to study how changes in
 ownership affect the incentives of employees as well as those of
 owner-managers.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Crime of 1873. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1159-94
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The U.S. Coinage Act of 1873 eliminated provision for the free coinage of
 silver. That act cast the die for a gold standard. The conventional view
 is that "the act of 1873 was a piece of good fortune." This paper
 indicates that it was the opposite--a mistake that had highly adverse
 consequences. This is a judgment about 1873, not 1896. By 1896, when
 William Jennings Bryan ran for president on a "free-silver ticket," it was
 too late to undo the damage. Bryan was trying to close the barn door after
 the horse had been stolen.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Campaign Contributions as Investments: The U.S. House of Representatives, 1980-1986. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1195-1227
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper treats the market for special-interest campaign contributions
 and political "favors" as a simple asset market. The model yields a simple
 equilibrium relationship among three variables: the total amount of
 investor contributions a candidate receives, the monetary value of the
 favors he has promised, and his probability of winning. Using data on
 open-seat races for the U.S. House of Representatives, the author
 confronts the model with a series of tests. Despite the starkness of the
 model, the results of these tests are highly supportive.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Collectivization and China's Agricultural Crisis in 1959-1961. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1228-52
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The agricultural crisis in China in 1959-61, after the initial success of
 the collectivization movement, resulted in 30 million extra deaths. In
 this paper, a game theory hypothesis proposes the main cause of this
 catastrophe. I argue that, because of the difficulty in supervising
 agricultural work, the success of an agricultural collective depends on a
 self-enforcing contract, however, can be sustained only in a repeated
 game. In the fall of 1958, the right to withdraw from a collective was
 deprived. The nature of the collectivization was thus changed from a
 repeated game to a one-time game. As a result, the self-enforcing contract
 could not be sustained and agricultural productivity collapsed.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Do Smokers Underestimate Risks? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1253-69
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper uses a national survey of 3,119 individuals to examine the
 effect of lung cancer risk perceptions on smoking activity. Both smokers
 and nonsmokers greatly overestimated the lung cancer risk of cigarette
 smoking, and the extent of the overestimation is much greater than the
 extent of underestimation. These risk perceptions in turn significantly
 reduce the probability of smoking, as suggested by an economic model of
 risky consumption decisions. Cigarette excise taxes in effect endow
 individuals with additional risk perceptions comparable to their current
 assessed lung cancer risks.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Vacancy, Search, and Prices in a Housing Market Matching Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1270-92
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A model of the single-family housing market is proposed in which
 households that move are both buyers and sellers. Households move when a
 stochastic process leaves them dissatisifed with their current unit.
 Household buyers expend costly search effort to find a better house, while
 sellers hold two units until a buyer is found. The vacancy rate, fixed in
 the short run, determines the expected length of sale and search, which
 play a central role in the reservation prices of buyer and seller. Market
 prices, the result of bargaining, lie between these two. The model yields
 a strong theoretical relationship (inverse) between vacancy and prices,
 which with competitive supply explains the existence of longer-run
 "structural" vacancy.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Marginal Cost Pricing When Spot Markets Are Complete. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1293-1306
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The standard formulation of a spot mark et subject to uncertain excess
 demand uses a tatonnement process that restricts trade until the
 market-clearing price is found. I present a model in which there is no
 restriction on trade during the process of the resolution of uncertainty
 about aggregate excess demand. the idea is to enlarge the commodity space
 and define goods by the probability that they will sell, in addition to
 other characteristics. The probability of sale characteristic is the spot
 market analogue of the contingencies under which delivery will take place
 in the Arrow-Debreu model. A failure to distinguish goods by the
 probability of sale characteristic can lead to the rejection of the
 competitive paradigm.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Do Tournaments Have Incentive Effects? 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1307-24
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Much attention has been devoted to studying models of tournaments or
 situations in which an individual's payment depends only on his or her
 output or rank relative to that of other competitors. Under certain sets
 of assumptions, tournaments have desirable normative properties because of
 the incentive structures they provide. Our paper uses nonexperimental data
 to test whether tournaments actually elicit effort responses. We focus on
 professional golf tournaments because information on the incentive
 structure (prize distribution) and measures of individual output (players'
 scores) are both available. We find string support for the proposition
 that the level and structure of prizes in PGA tournaments influence
 players performance.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1325-48
Issue: 6
Volume: 98
Year: 1990
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Contrary to theoretical expectations, measures of willingness-to-accept
 greatly exceed measures of willingness-to-pay. This paper reports several
 experiments that demonstrate that this "endowment effect" persists even in
 market settings with opportunities to learn. Consumption objects (e.g.,
 coffee mugs) are randomly given to half the subjects in an experiment.
 Markets for the mugs are then conducted. The Coase theorem predicts that
 about half the mugs will trade, but observed volume is always
 significantly less. When markets for "induced-value" tokens are conducted,
 the predicted volume is observed, suggesting that transactions costs
 cannot explain the undertrading for consumption goods.  Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press.
