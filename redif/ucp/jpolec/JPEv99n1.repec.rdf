Title:   A Theory of Quits and Layoffs with Efficient Turnover. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1-29
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper answers the efficient-turnover literature's long silence
 regarding the quit-layoff distinction. Treating quits as worker-initiated
 separations, the author establishes that the existence of layoffs is
 compatible with optimizing workers and firms forming and dissolving
 employment matches to exploit all the gains from trade. The
 efficient-turnover approach is shown to be consistent with many empirical
 regularities that distinguish quits from layoffs. Structural implications
 of the model are tested on data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Evidence on Bidding Strategies and the Information in Treasury Bill Auctions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 100-130
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The empirical results presented suggest that imperfect information is
 present in the Treasury bill market. The mean auction price for
 three-month bills is, on average, four basis points below the comparable
 secondary market price of the 1973 period. This "downward biasing" is
 positively related to the anticipated amount of dispersion of auction
 bids. This suggests that auction bidders use a bidding strategy that
 accounts for their lack of agreement about the value of the bill. Further,
 the secondary bill market learns from the bill action, implying that these
 two markets aggregate traders' private information differently.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rational Speculation. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 131-44
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The stationary equilibrium of an overlapping generations economy in which
 agents trade a single asset is examined. If agents live for only two
 periods, the selling prices follow an identically and independently
 distributed process. If agents live for more than two periods, the selling
 prices follow a Markov process. An implication of the model is that price
 bubbles can occur in a stationary, rational expectations equilibrium.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Specific Capital, Mobility, and Wages: Wages Rise with Job Seniority. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 145-76
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper uses longitudinal data to estimate a lower bound on the
 average return to job seniority among adjustment. The author finds that
 ten years of current job seniority raise the wage of the typical male
 worker in the United States by over 25 percent. This is an estimate of
 what the typical worker would lose if his job were to end exogenously.
 Overall, the evidence implies that accumulation of specific capital is an
 important ingredient of the typical employment relationship and of
 life-cycle earnings and productivity as well. Continuation of these
 relationships has substantial specific value for workers.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Smoking, Skydiving, and Knitting: The Endogenous Categorization of Risks in Insurance Markets with Asymmetric Information. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 177-200
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The authors analyze the efficiency and market equilibrium of endogenous
 categorization, where insurance companies classify risks on the basis of
 insureds' voluntary consumption of products that are correlated with
 underlying loss propensities, and they show that the use of such
 categorization may permit the attainment of first-best allocations as
 competitive Nash equilibria. The optimal insurance premium involves a
 trade-off between the use of categorization to correct moral hazard
 externalities generated by the consumption of the product and the use of
 differential consumption to sort heterogenous consumers, thereby
 mitigating the social costs of adverse selection.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Price Discrimination and Retail Configuration. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 30-53
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  The hypothesis that price discrimination based on willingness-to-pay for
 quality can occur in multifirm markets is confirmed using microdata on
 gasoline retailing. A test that discriminates between price structures
 associated with discrimination and with cost-driven, competitive
 differentials is developed and implemented with controls for variation in
 outlet and market characteristics. A second test based on profitability
 variation rejects a competitive, peak-load pricing explanation for the
 observed price dispersion. The data suggest that price discrimination at
 the retail level adds at least nine cents a gallon to the average price of
 full-service gasoline.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Poverty and the Rate of Time Preference: Evidence from Panel Data. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 54-77
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to study the
 intertemporal preferences of rich and poor households in the United
 States. Subjective rates of time preferences, identified from estimation
 of consumption Euler equations, are three to five percentage points higher
 for households with low permanent incomes than for those with high
 permanent incomes. Controlling for race and education widens this
 difference. With age and family composition held constant, time preference
 rates vary from 12 percent for white, college-educated families in the top
 5 percent of the labor income distribution to 19 percent for nonwhite
 families without a college education whose labor incomes are in the bottom
 fifth percentile.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Primogeniture. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 78-99
Issue: 1
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  February 
Abstract:
  On the basis of anthropologists' area-specific research of primogeniture,
 the author proposes a Becker-Barro type of dynastic model in which
 primogeniture may emerge as family heads' optimal policy to minimize their
 respective lineal extinction probability. The author shows that parents'
 bequest division will be affected by the intrinsic mobility structure of
 the society, contrary to previous causality conjecture. Although an
 unequal division of bequests widens the within-generation inequality, it
 may increase the intergenerational upward mobility for the well-endowed
 child, which in turn improves the originally rigid upward mobility of the
 poor and middle-income groups and, as a result, reduces the steady-state
 income inequality.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
