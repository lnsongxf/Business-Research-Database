Title:   Implications of Security Market Data for Models of Dynamic Economies. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 225-62
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The authors show how to use security market data to restrict the
 admissible region for means and standard deviations of intertemporal
 marginal rates of substitution of consumers. Their approach (1) is
 nonparametric and applies to a rich class of models of dynamic economics;
 (2) characterizes the duality between the mean-standard deviation frontier
 for intertemporal marginal rates of substitution and the familiar
 mean-standard deviation frontier for asset returns; and (3) exploits the
 restriction that intertemporal marginal rates of substitution are positive
 random variables. The region provides a convenient summary of the sense in
 which asset market data are anomalous from the vantage point of
 intertemporal asset pricing theory.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Substitution, Risk Aversion, and the Temporal Behavior of Consumption and Asset Returns: An Empirical Analysis. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 263-86
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper investigates the testable restriction on the time-series
 behavior of consumption and asset returns implied by a representative
 agent model in which intertemporal preferences are represented by utility
 functions that generalize conventional, time-additive, expected utility.
 The model based on these preferences allows a clearer separation of
 observable behavior attributable to risk aversion and to intertemporal
 substitution. Further, it nests the predictions of both the consumption
 CAPM and the static CAPM, and it allows direct tests of the expected
 utility hypothesis. We find that the performance of the non-expected
 utility model and tests of the expected utility hypothesis are sensitive
 to the choice of both consumption measure and instrumental variables.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Health Behavior, Health Knowledge, and Schooling. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 287-305
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  The positive correlation between schooling and good health is well
 documented. One explanation is that schooling helps people choose
 healthier life-styles by improving their knowledge of the relationships
 between health behaviors and health outcomes. That is, schooling improves
 the household's allocative efficiency in producing health. This empirical
 study uses direct measures of health knowledge to test this explanation.
 Part of the relationship between schooling and the consumption of
 cigarettes, alcohol, and exercise is explained by differences in health
 knowledge. However, most of schooling's effects on health behavior remain
 after differences in knowledge are controlled for.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Nonconvex Costs and the Behavior of Inventories. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 306-34
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper explores one possible explanation for the apparent excess
 volatility of production relative to sales: nonconvexities in the
 technology facing firms. It is shown that if firms operated in a region of
 declining marginal costs, then small shifts in demand can cause production
 to jump substantially. Estimates for six production-to-stock industries,
 as well as the automobile industry, suggest that all these industries
 behave as if they were operating in the region of nonconvex costs. The
 results have important implications not only for inventory investment, but
 also for the cyclical behavior of productivity and prices.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Politics of Intergenerational Redistribution. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 335-57
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper studies the political-economic equilibrium of a two-period
 model with overlapping generations. In each period, the policy is chosen
 under majority rule by the generations currently alive. The paper
 identifies a "politically viable" set of values for public debt. Any
 amount of debt within this set is fully repaid in equilibrium, even
 without commitments. By issuing debt within this set, the first generation
 redistributes revenue in its favor and away from the second generation.
 The paper characterizes the determinants of the equilibrium
 intergenerational redistribution and identifies a difference between debt
 and social security as instruments of redistribution.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Variability of Velocity in Cash-in-Advance Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 358-84
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  Monetary models based on cash-in-advance constraints make strong
 predictions about the stochastic properties of endogenous variables such
 as the velocity of circulation of money, the rate of inflation, and real
 and nominal interest rates. The authors develop numerical methods to
 understand these predictions because the models cannot be characterized
 analytically. They calibrate some cash-in-advance models using driving
 processes estimated from U.S. time-series data to generate model
 predictions that are compared to sample statistics. Formulations of the
 models that generate variability in velocity corresponding to the U.S.
 data typically fail along other dimensions.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Variation of Economic Risk Premiums. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 385-415
Issue: 2
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  April 
Abstract:
  This paper provides an analysis of the predictable components of monthly
 common stock and bond portfolio return. Most of the predictability is
 associated with sensitivity to economic variables in a rational asset
 pricing model with multiple betas. The stock market risk premium is the
 most important for capturing predictable variation of the stock
 portfolios, while premiums associated with interest rate risks capture
 predictability of the bond returns. Time variation in the premium for beta
 risk is more important than changes in the betas.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
