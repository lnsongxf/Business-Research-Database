Title:   Procyclical Labor Productivity and Competing Theories of the Business Cycle: Some Evidence from Interwar U.S. Manufacturing Industries. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 439-59
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors study the phenomenon of short-run increasing returns to labor
 (SRIRL) in a sample of ten interwar U.S. manufacturing industries. Their
 authors main findings are that SRIRL was common in the interwar period and
 that the pattern of SRIRL across industries was similar to that observed
 in the postwar period. The authors argue that, since presumably the
 Depression was not caused by technical regress, these findings are
 inconsistent with the claim of real business cycle theorists that SRIRL
 are, in general, due to procyclical technological shocks. They propose
 tests for discriminating between two other leading explanations of SRIRL,
 but find that their conclusions differ by industry.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Microeconomic Mechanism for Economic Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 460-82
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model in which
 economic growth is explained by the evolution of the division of labor.
 The relationships among the accumulation of human capital, the evolution
 of the division of labor, endogenous comparative advantage, trade
 dependence, the market structure, and economic growth are investigated.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Increasing Returns and Economic Geography. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 483-99
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a simple model that shows how a country can
 endogenously become differentiated into an industrialized "core" and an
 agricultural "periphery." In order to realize scale economies while
 minimizing transport costs, manufacturing firms tend to locate in the
 region with larger demand, but the location of demand itself depends on
 the distribution of manufacturing. Emergence of a core-periphery pattern
 depends on transportations costs, economies of scale, and the share of
 manufacturing in national income.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Long-Run Policy Analysis and Long-Run Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 500-521
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The wide cross-country disparity in rates of economic growth is the most
 puzzling feature of the development process. This paper describes a class
 of models in which this heterogeneity in growth experiences can be the
 result of cross-country differences in government policy. These
 differences can also create incentives for labor migration from
 slow-growing to fast-growing countries. In the models considered, growth
 is endogenous, despite the absence of increasing returns, because there is
 a "core" of capital goods that can be produced without the direct or
 indirect contribution of factors that cannot be accumulated, such as land.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Income Convergence in an Endogenous Growth Model. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 522-40
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  An endogenous growth model is developed that produces convergence in per
 capita income and growth rates of output. Agents have identical
 preferences and access to identical technologies of production and
 investment, but differing levels of initial human capital. A spillover
 effect of human capital in the investment technology provides
 below-average human capital agents with a higher rate of return on
 investment than above-average human capital agents. Thus, below-average
 human capital agents grow faster than above-average human capital agents.
 This model explains income convergence of the developed world, regional
 income convergence within the United States, and intergenerational
 mobility.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Irreversible Investment with Price Ceilings. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 541-57
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  A model of irreversible investment in a competitive industry under demand
 uncertainty is developed. In the absence of restrictions, investment by
 itself will keep the price from rising above a natural ceiling that
 exceeds the long-run average cost by an option value factor. When a lower
 ceiling is imposed, investment is triggered only by the observation of an
 even higher "shadow" price. As the imposed ceiling is reduced to the
 long-run average cost, this shadow price goes to infinity and investment
 ceases completely. Because investment is depressed, a tighter price
 ceiling generally leads to a higher long-run average price.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Production Smoothing Evidence from Physical-Product Data. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 558-81
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  The authors reconsider the paradox that the variance of production often
 exceeds the variance of shipments, a result that casts doubt on the
 production smoothing model of inventory behavior. Most studies of
 production smoothing have analyzed two-digit SIC dollar-value data from
 Commerce Department surveys. In contrast, this paper reexamines
 disaggregated physical-product data and finds that production is smoother
 than shipments in about two-thirds of the thirty-eight industry or product
 groupings considered. However, doubts about the model persist; most
 notably, Euler equation estimates of the model's cost parameters are
 usually imprecise and often do not have the signs postulated by production
 smoothing models.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effects of Child Mortality Changes on Fertility Choice and Parental Welfare. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 582-606
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Empirical studies have overwhelmingly shown that a lower child mortality
 rate leads to lower fertility. Yet it has not been possible to
 satisfactorily analyze this relationship in even the simplest theoretical
 models. This paper attempts to bridge this gap between theory and the
 empirical literature. The paper also presents results on the effects of
 child mortality changes on parental welfare. The analysis captures the
 dynamic stochastic feature of fertility choice, subsumes other endogenous
 choices (e.g., the quality of the children), and treats the number of
 children as a discrete variable (this added realism is important for the
 analysis).  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Simple Nonadditive Preference Structure for Models of Household Behavior over Time. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 607-37
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Intertemporal separability is an almost universal assumption in empirical
 work on household behavior, but a good deal of recent work on consumption
 and labor supply suggest that it may not be tenable. The traditional
 weakening of this assumption is to allow for habit formation. The authors
 propose an alternative structure for intertemporal preferences that nests
 intertemporal additivity in a simple way and yields closed-form solutions
 for demand functions. This structure includes the neoclassical durables
 model as a special case. The author derives a demand system that nests the
 almost ideal system as its time-separable counterpart. This model is
 estimated on U.K. aggregate time-series data for seven goods. Time
 separability is decisively rejected.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Effects of Risk Aversion on Wagering: Point Spread versus Odds. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 638-53
Issue: 3
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  June 
Abstract:
  Currently, casinos and bookies use the point-spread method for betting on
 football games. Since an odds system is used in various other sports, what
 factors explain the current structure of the betting market? As the
 bookie's profits are a percentage of the total money wagered, the
 existence of point-spread betting indicates that the total money wagered
 under this betting scheme is greater than that generated by odds betting.
 This paper suggests that the current market structure is a consequence of
 risk-averse attitudes of bettors.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
