Title:   The Effect of Implicit Contracts on the Movement of Wages over the Business Cycle: Evidence from Micro Data. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 665-88
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors address the question of whether wages are
 affected by labor-market conditions in a manner more consistent with a
 contract approach than with a standard spot market model. From a simple
 implicit contract model, they derive implications about the links between
 wages and past labor market conditions. Using individual data from the
 Current Population Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the
 authors find that an implicit contract model with costless mobility
 describes these links better than either a simple spot market model or an
 implicit contract model with costly mobility.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Monitoring and Reputation: The Choice between Bank Loans and Directly Placed Debt. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 689-721
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper determines when a debt contract will be monitored by lenders.
 This is the choice between borrowing directly (issuing a bond, without
 monitoring) and borrowing through a bank that monitors to alleviate moral
 hazard. This provides a theory of bank loan demand and of the role of
 monitoring in circumstances in which reputation effects are important. A
 key result is that borrowers with credit ratings toward the middle of the
 spectrum rely on bank loans, and in periods of high interest rates or low
 future profitability, higher-rated borrowers choose to borrow from banks.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Rational Addictive Behavior and Cigarette Smoking. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 722-42
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Cigarette demand equations accounting for tolerance, reinforcement, and
 withdrawal are derived using the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction
 and are estimated using data from the second National Health and Nutrition
 Examination Survey. Estimates imply that smoking is addictive, individuals
 are not myopic, and price increases would reduce demand. Implications
 concerning time preference and addiction are tested by estimating the
 demand separately for samples based on age and education. Less educated
 (younger) individuals are found to behave more myopically than more
 educated (older) individuals, whereas more addicted (myopic) individuals
 are found to respond more to price, in the long run, than less addicted
 (myopic) individuals.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Money, Barter, and the Optimality of Legal Restrictions. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 743-73
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  We examine a decentralized monetary economy in which households can use a
 means of exchange (barter or gold) other than fiat money. The alternative
 means of exchange may drive out money even if monetary exchange Pareto
 dominates. Legal restrictions prohibiting other means of exchange may
 therefore be necessary. With stochastic preferences, households may use
 barter to supplement monetary purchases when they have an unexpectedly
 high demand. However, this may drive down the value of money (in all
 states) so low that households are again better off with fiat money alone.
 The paper provides both stochastic and nonstochastic examples in which
 eliminating markets for goods or assets that compete with fiat money
 improves welfare.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Structure of Local Public Finance and the Quality of Life. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 774-806
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Differences in local fiscal conditions generate compensating
 differentials across local land and labor markets just as the authors have
 known amenities to do. Thus, the local fiscal climate affects the quality
 of life across metropolitan areas. The authors present new results showing
 that intercity fiscal differentials are nearly as important as amenity
 differentials in determining the quality of life across urban areas. The
 paper also investigates the sensitivity of the quality-of-life rankings
 with respect to assumptions about the nature of the marginal entrant. The
 authors estimate a random effects model to account for city-specific error
 components in the housing and wage regressions.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Innovation, Imitation, and Economic Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 807-27
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model of economic
 growth. The model has a steady-state equilibrium in which some firms
 devote resources to copying these products. Rates of both innovation and
 imitation are endogenously determined on the basis of the outcomes of R&D
 races between firms. Innovation subsidies are shown to unambiguously
 promote economic growth. Welfare is enhanced, however, only if the
 steady-state intensity of innovative effort exceeds a critical level.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Mobility and Redistribution. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 828-58
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The ability of individuals to move freely from one jurisdiction to
 another is generally seen as a constraint on the amount of redistribution
 that each jurisdiction within a system of governments can undertake. In
 this paper, the authors look at this proposition by developing a positive
 analysis of income redistribution by local governments in a federal
 system. They ask how much redistribution occurs when only local government
 can have tax/transfer instruments, individuals can move freely among
 jurisdictions, and voters in each jurisdiction are fully aware of the
 migration effects of redistributive policies. Local redistribution is
 shown to induce sorting of the population.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Self-Screening in Targeted Public Transfer Programs. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 859-76
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  The self-screening properties of initial eligibility determination, a
 mechanism often under the control of the administrators of targeted
 transfer programs, are derived and the use of this mechanism in the social
 security disability insurance system is explored empirically. An increase
 in the rigor of initial eligibility screening may discourage potential
 applicants because they are unaware of appeal prospects and because the
 eligibility decision delay is lengthened, as denied applicants are forced
 to appeal their claims. In the disability program, a 10 percent increase
 in the initial denial rate induces a 4 percent decrease in applications.

Title:   Rational Choice: The Contrast between Economics and Psychology. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 877-97
Issue: 4
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  August 
Abstract:
  Rational Choice--the published record of a conference on economics and
 psychology--frames the issues as a contest between economic theory and the
 falsifying evidence from psychology. According to a third perspective,
 that of experimental economics, most standard theory provides a correct
 first approximation in predicting motivated behavior in laboratory
 experimental markets, but the theory is incomplete, particularly in
 articulating convergence processes in time and in ignoring decision cost.
 This view has roots in the work of Herbert Simon and Signey Siegel, but it
 is not plainly represented in contemporary research in economic
 psychology.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
