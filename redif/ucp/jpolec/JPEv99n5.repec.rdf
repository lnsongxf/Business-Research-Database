Title:   Most-Favored-Customer Protection versus Price Discrimination over Time. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1010-28
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  How should a seller price capacity that has no salvage value to
 heterogeneous customers whose valuations are private information? There
 are two periods, and the seller cannot precommit to prices in the later
 period. One option is price discrimination: first price high, then
 discount later if excess capacity remains. By offering
 most-favored-customer protection, the seller can charge more in advance,
 but will leave capacity unsold with positive probability. The author
 favors the most-favored-customer protection when capacity is large and
 leans toward price discrimination when customers are more uncertain about
 the degree of excess demand in the first period.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Intergenerational Trade, Longevity, and Economic Growth. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1029-59
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  The authors develop an overlapping-generations model of endogenous growth
 in which human capital is the engine of growth and the generations are
 linked through material and emotional interdependencies within the family.
 Parents invest in their children to achieve both old-age support (care)
 and emotional gratification, and material support from children is
 determined through self-enforcing implicit contracts. The authors show
 that optimal intergenerational trade can then lead to maximization of
 growth opportunities. Their model produces a theory of the "demographic
 transition" linking longevity, fertility, and economic growth.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Transactions Costs and the Efficient Organization of Production: A Study of Timber-Harvesting Contracts. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1060-87
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  A transaction costs framework is developed to explain the choice between
 lump-sum and per unit payment provisions in private timber-harvesting
 contracts. Predictions about which contract type minimizes the transaction
 costs of presale measurement and contract enforcement and monitoring are
 derived and tested using private timber sales contracts from North
 Carolina. The empirical results provide strong support for the transaction
 costs approach and also reject several predictions from a risk-based
 model. The transaction costs framework also provides insights into the
 choice between negotiated and competitive sales procedures.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Specific versus General Enforcement of Law. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1088-1108
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Optimal enforcement of law is examined in a model with specific
 enforcement effort--effort devoted toward apprehending individuals who
 have committed a single type of harmful act--and general enforcement
 effort--effort devoted toward apprehending individuals who have committed
 any of a range of harmful acts (a police officer on patrol, for instance,
 is able to apprehend many types of violators of law). If enforcement
 effort is specific, optimal sanctions are extreme for all acts. If
 enforcement effort is general, however, optimal sanctions rise with the
 harmfulness of acts and reach the extreme only for the most harmful acts.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Note on Restaurant Pricing and Other Examples of Social Influences on Price. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1109-16
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This note tries to explain why many successful restaurants, plays,
 sporting events, and other activities do not raise prices even with
 persistent excess demand. The authors approach assumes that demand by a
 typical consumer is positively related to quantities demanded by other
 consumers. This can explain not only the puzzle about prices, but also why
 consumer demand is often fickle, why it is much easier to go from being
 "in" to being "out" than from "out" to "in," and why supply does not
 increase to reduce the excess demand.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   How Strong Are Bequest Motives? Evidence Based on Estimates of the Demand for Life Insurance and Annuities. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 899-927
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper presents new empirical evidence in support of the view that a
 significant fraction of total saving is motivated by the desire to leave
 bequests. Specifically, the author finds that social security annuity
 benefits significantly raise life insurance holdings and depress private
 annuity holdings among elderly individuals. These patterns indicate that
 the typical household would choose to maintain a positive fraction of its
 resources in bequeathable forms, even if insurance markets were perfect.
 Evidence on the relationship between insurance purchases and total
 resources reinforces this conclusion.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Full Insurance in the Presence of Aggregate Uncertainty. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 928-56
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper tests implications of full consumption insurance. The object
 is to determine how much mileage can be obtained from a model with
 complete markets, with such features as private information or liquidity
 constraints omitted. The implication exploited is that individual
 consumption responds to aggregate risk but not to idiosyncratic risk. The
 test involves regressing the change in household consumption onto the
 change in aggregate consumption and other right-hand-side variables such
 as the change in household income and change in employment status. All
 variables other than the change in aggregate consumption are predicted to
 be insignificant in explaining the change in household consumption.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   A Simple Test of Consumption Insurance. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 957-76
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  Are consumers effectively insured against idiosyncratic shocks to income
 or wealth, either by formal institutions such as charities, private
 insurance, and government programs or by informal mechanisms such as gifts
 and "loans" from relatives, friends, and neighbors? Under full insurance,
 consumption growth should be cross-sectionally independent of
 idiosyncratic variables that are exogenous to consumers. This proposition
 is tested by cross-sectional regressions of consumption growth on a
 variety of exogenous variables. Full insurance is rejected for long
 illness and involuntary job loss, but not for spells of unemployment, loss
 of work due to strike, and an involuntary move.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Entry and Competition in Concentrated Markets. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 977-1009
Issue: 5
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  October 
Abstract:
  This paper proposes an empirical framework for measuring the effects of
 entry in concentrated markets. Building on models of entry in
 atomistically competitive markets, the authors show how the number of
 producers in an oligopolistic market varies with changes in demand and
 market competition. These analytical results structure the authors'
 empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional
 industries. Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies,
 and oligopolies, they study the relationship between the number of firms
 in a market, market size, and competition. The authors' empirical results
 suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of
 incumbents increases.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
