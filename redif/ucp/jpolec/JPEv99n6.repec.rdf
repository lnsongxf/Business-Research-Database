Title:   Modeling Marital Connections among Family Lines. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1123-41
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper examines the role of marital connections in models of
 intertemporal household behavior. Recent work by B. Douglas Bernheim and
 Kyle Bagwell (1988) implies that such connections might vastly expand the
 scope of neutrality results. The present work studies several formulations
 including not only marriage but also descriptions of how people choose
 spouses. Purposeful choices lead to assortative mating. All versions of
 the framework tend to lead away from cross-sectional neutrality results.
 The analysis suggests that one may be able to derive a solution for a
 parthenogenetic model and then interpret it as consistent with Nash
 equilibrium behavior in a world with marriage.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Vintage Human Capital, Growth, and the Diffusion of New Technology. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1142-65
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a model of vintage human capital in which each
 technology requires vintage-specific skills. They examine the properties
 of a stationary equilibrium for their economy. The stationary equilibrium
 is characterized by an endogenous distribution of skilled workers across
 vintages. The distribution is shown to be single-peaked. Under general
 conditions, there is a lag between the appearance of a technology and its
 peak usage, a phenomenon known as diffusion. An increase in the rate of
 exogenous technological change shifts the distribution of human capital to
 more recent vintages, thereby increasing the diffusion rate.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Homework in Macroeconomics: Household Production and Aggregate Fluctuations. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1166-87
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper explores some macroeconomic implications of including
 household production in an otherwise standard real business cycle model.
 The authors calibrate the model on the basis of microeconomic evidence and
 long-run considerations, simulate it, and examine its statistical
 properties. They find that introducing home production significantly
 improves the quantitative performance of the standard model along several
 dimensions. It also implies a very different interpretation of the nature
 of aggregate fluctuations.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   The Allocation of Capital and Time over the Business Cycle. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1188-214
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  A Beckerian model of household production is developed to study the
 cyclical allocation of capital and time between market and home
 activities. The adopted framework treats the business and household
 sectors symmetrically. In the market, labor interacts with business
 capital to produce market goods and services, and likewise at home the
 remaining time (leisure) is combined with household capital to produce
 home goods and services. The model presented is parameterized and
 simulated to see whether it can rationalize the observed allocation of
 capital and time, as well as other stylized facts, for the postwar U.S.
 economy.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Asset Prices and Interest Rates in Cash-in-Advance Models. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1215-51
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  The authors develop a method to solve and simulate cash-in-advance models
 of money and asset prices. They calibrate the models to U.S. data spanning
 the period 1890-1987 and study some empirical regularities observed over
 this period. The phenomena of interest include the average level of stock
 returns and returns on nominal bonds, the covariation of realized real
 interest rates and real asset returns with inflation, and the ability of
 nominal interest rates to predict inflation and nominal stock returns.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Real Exchange Rates under the Gold Standard. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1252-71
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  In this paper, the authors assert that most studies that have sought to
 determine the validity of purchasing power parity are flawed for two
 reasons. First, post-1973 data contain, by definition, only a very limited
 amount of the low-frequency information relevant for examination of
 long-run parity. Second, the dynamic econometric techniques used to model
 deviations from parity are typically quite crude with respect to
 admissible low-frequency dynamics. Both deficiencies are rectified in the
 present paper, with dramatic results. With a new longer data set, the
 authors study deviations from parity using long-memory models that allow
 for subtle forms of mean reversion.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Social Osmosis and Patterns of Crime. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1272-95
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  Crime and the fear of crime have a deep negative impact on personal and
 societal well-being. Several observed patterns regarding criminal
 behavior, however, remain inadequately understood. In this analysis,
 individual's perceptions (concerning their probabilities of punishment)
 and choices are determined endogenously, while incorporating the
 information available to them and how this information is generated within
 the economy. The resulting dynamic relationships are then studied to
 examine how criminality might evolve over time, why crime participation
 rates might differ among societal groups even when they face similar
 economic fundamentals, and how the features of the economy might affect
 these rates.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.

Title:   Mercantilism as Strategic Trade Policy: The Anglo-Dutch Rivalry for the East India Trade. 
Journal: Journal of Political Economy
Pages: 1296-314
Issue: 6
Volume: 99
Year: 1991
Month:  December 
Abstract:
  This paper interprets seventeenth-century mercantilism, when
 international trade was conducted chiefly by state-chartered monopoly
 trading companies, in light of recent theories of strategic trade policy.
 The Anglo-Dutch rivalry for the East India trade illustrates a case in
 which the profit-shifting motive for strategic trade policies exists.
 Dutch supremacy in the early East India trade was facilitated by a
 managerial incentive scheme in the monopoly charter that enabled it to
 achieve a Stackelberg leadership position. Data from the East India trade
 around 1620 are used in a Cournot duopoly model to examine the possible
 effects of other policies.  Copyright 1991 by University of Chicago Press.
