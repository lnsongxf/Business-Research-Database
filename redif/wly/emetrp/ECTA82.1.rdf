Title: Asymptotically Efficient Estimation of Models Defined by Convex Moment Inequalities 
Author-Name: Hiroaki Kaido  
Author-Name: Andres Santos  
Abstract:
  This paper examines the efficient estimation of partially identified
 models defined by moment inequalities that are convex in the parameter of
 interest. In such a setting, the identified set is itself convex and hence
 fully characterized by its support function. We provide conditions under
 which, despite being an infinite dimensional parameter, the support
 function admits √n‐consistent regular estimators. A semiparametric
 efficiency bound is then derived for its estimation, and it is shown that
 any regular estimator attaining it must also minimize a wide class of
 asymptotic loss functions. In addition, we show that the “plug‐in”
 estimator is efficient, and devise a consistent bootstrap procedure for
 estimating its limiting distribution. The setting we examine is related to
 an incomplete linear model studied in Beresteanu and Molinari (2008) and
 Bontemps, Magnac, and Maurin (2012), which further enables us to establish
 the semiparametric efficiency of their proposed estimators for that
 problem.

Title: Optimal Taxes on Fossil Fuel in General Equilibrium 
Author-Name: Mikhail Golosov  
Author-Name: John Hassler  
Author-Name: Per Krusell  
Author-Name: Aleh Tsyvinski  
Abstract:
  We analyze a dynamic stochastic general‐equilibrium (DSGE) model with an
 externality—through climate change—from using fossil energy. Our central
 result is a simple formula for the marginal externality damage of
 emissions (or, equivalently, for the optimal carbon tax). This formula,
 which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is
 proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three
 factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many
 percent of the output flow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the
 atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the
 atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and
 the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as well as the paths of
 technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on,
 all disappear from the formula. We find that the optimal tax should be a
 bit higher than the median, or most well‐known, estimates in the
 literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily
 solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the
 use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change.
 We find coal—rather than oil—to be the main threat to economic welfare,
 largely due to its abundance. We also find that the costs of inaction are
 particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability
 of different energy sources and technological progress.

Title: The Elite Illusion: Achievement Effects at Boston and New York Exam Schools 
Author-Name: Atila Abdulkadiroğlu  
Author-Name: Joshua Angrist  
Author-Name: Parag Pathak  
Abstract:
  Parents gauge school quality in part by the level of student achievement
 and a school's racial and socioeconomic mix. The importance of school
 characteristics in the housing market can be seen in the jump in house
 prices at school district boundaries where peer characteristics change.
 The question of whether schools with more attractive peers are really
 better in a value‐added sense remains open, however. This paper uses a
 fuzzy regression‐discontinuity design to evaluate the causal effects of
 peer characteristics. Our design exploits admissions cutoffs at Boston and
 New York City's heavily over‐subscribed exam schools. Successful
 applicants near admissions cutoffs for the least selective of these
 schools move from schools with scores near the bottom of the state SAT
 score distribution to schools with scores near the median. Successful
 applicants near admissions cutoffs for the most selective of these schools
 move from above‐average schools to schools with students whose scores fall
 in the extreme upper tail. Exam school students can also expect to study
 with fewer nonwhite classmates than unsuccessful applicants. Our estimates
 suggest that the marked changes in peer characteristics at exam school
 admissions cutoffs have little causal effect on test scores or college
 quality.

Title: Identification in Auctions With Selective Entry 
Author-Name: Matthew Gentry  
Author-Name: Tong Li  
Abstract:
  This paper considers nonparametric identification of a two‐stage entry
 and bidding game we call the Affiliated‐Signal (AS) model. This model
 assumes that potential bidders have private values, observe signals of
 their values prior to entry, and then choose whether to undertake a costly
 entry process, but imposes only minimal structure on the relationship
 between signals and values. It thereby nests a wide range of entry
 processes, including in particular the Samuelson (1985) and Levin and
 Smith (1994) models as special cases. Working within the AS model, we map
 variation in factors affecting entry behavior (potential competition or
 entry costs) into identified bounds on model fundamentals. These bounds
 are constructive, collapse to point identification when available entry
 variation is continuous, and can readily be refined to produce the
 pointwise sharp identified set. We then extend our core results to
 accommodate nonseparable unobserved auction‐level heterogeneity and
 potential endogeneity of entry shifters, thereby establishing a formal
 identification framework for structural analysis of auctions with
 selective entry.

Title: Price Setting With Menu Cost for Multiproduct Firms 
Author-Name: Fernando Alvarez  
Author-Name: Francesco Lippi  
Abstract:
  We model the decisions of a multiproduct firm that faces a fixed “menu”
 cost: once it is paid, the firm can adjust the price of all its products.
 We characterize analytically the steady state firm's decisions in terms of
 the structural parameters: the variability of the flexible prices, the
 curvature of the profit function, the size of the menu cost, and the
 number of products sold. We provide expressions for the steady state
 frequency of adjustment, the hazard rate of price adjustments, and the
 size distribution of price changes, all in terms of the structural
 parameters. We study analytically the impulse response of aggregate prices
 and output to a monetary shock. The size of the output response and its
 duration both increase with the number of products; they more than double
 as the number of products goes from 1 to 10, quickly converging to the
 response of Taylor's staggered price model.

Title: Competition for a Majority 
Author-Name: Paulo Barelli  
Author-Name: Srihari Govindan  
Author-Name: Robert Wilson  
Abstract:
  We define the class of two‐player zero‐sum games with payoffs having mild
 discontinuities, which in applications typically stem from how ties are
 resolved. For such games, we establish sufficient conditions for existence
 of a value of the game, maximin and minimax strategies for the players,
 and a Nash equilibrium. If all discontinuities favor one player, then a
 value exists and that player has a maximin strategy. A property called
 payoff approachability implies existence of an equilibrium, and that the
 resulting value is invariant: games with the same payoffs at points of
 continuity have the same value and ɛ‐equilibria. For voting games in which
 two candidates propose policies and a candidate wins election if a
 weighted majority of voters prefer his proposed policy, we provide
 tie‐breaking rules and assumptions about voters' preferences sufficient to
 imply payoff approachability. These assumptions are satisfied by generic
 preferences if the dimension of the space of policies exceeds the number
 of voters; or with no dimensional restriction, if the electorate is
 sufficiently large. Each Colonel Blotto game is a special case in which
 each candidate allocates a resource among several constituencies and a
 candidate gets votes from those allocated more than his opponent offers;
 in this case, for simple‐majority rule we prove existence of an
 equilibrium with zero probability of ties.

Title: Comment on “The Law of Large Demand for Information” 
Author-Name: Yaron Azrieli  
Abstract:
  Say that one information structure is eventually Blackwell sufficient for
 another if, for every large enough n, an n‐sample from the first is
 Blackwell sufficient (Blackwell (1951, 1954)) for an n‐sample from the
 second. This note shows that eventual Blackwell sufficiency lies strictly
 between (one‐shot) Blackwell sufficiency and the ordering of information
 structures formulated by Moscarini and Smith (2002), and thus offers a new
 criterion for comparing experiments. A characterization of eventual
 Blackwell sufficiency in terms of the one‐shot experiments remains an open
 question.

Title: Expected Uncertain Utility Theory 
Author-Name: Faruk Gul  
Author-Name: Wolfgang Pesendorfer  
Abstract:
  We introduce and analyze expected uncertain utility (EUU) theory. A prior
 and an interval utility characterize an EUU decision maker. The decision
 maker transforms each uncertain prospect into an interval‐valued prospect
 that assigns an interval of prizes to each state. She then ranks prospects
 according to their expected interval utilities. We define uncertainty
 aversion for EUU, use the EUU model to address the Ellsberg Paradox and
 other ambiguity evidence, and relate EUU theory to existing models.

Title: Short‐Run Subsidies and Long‐Run Adoption of New Health Products: Evidence From a Field Experiment 
Author-Name: Pascaline Dupas  
Abstract:
  Short‐run subsidies for health products are common in poor countries. How
 do they affect long‐run adoption? A common fear among development
 practitioners is that one‐off subsidies may negatively affect long‐run
 adoption through reference‐dependence: People might anchor around the
 subsidized price and be unwilling to pay more for the product later. But
 for experience goods, one‐off subsidies could also boost long‐run adoption
 through learning. This paper uses data from a two‐stage randomized pricing
 experiment in Kenya to estimate the relative importance of these effects
 for a new, improved antimalarial bed net. Reduced form estimates show that
 a one‐time subsidy has a positive impact on willingness to pay a year
 later inherit. To separately identify the learning and anchoring effects,
 we estimate a parsimonious experience‐good model. Estimation results show
 a large, positive learning effect but no anchoring. We black then discuss
 the types of products and the contexts inherit for which these results may
 apply.

Title: Entropic Latent Variable Integration via Simulation 
Author-Name: Susanne M. Schennach  
Abstract:
  This paper introduces a general method to convert a model defined by
 moment conditions that involve both observed and unobserved variables into
 equivalent moment conditions that involve only observable variables. This
 task can be accomplished without introducing infinite‐dimensional nuisance
 parameters using a least favorable entropy‐maximizing distribution. We
 demonstrate, through examples and simulations, that this approach covers a
 wide class of latent variables models, including some game‐theoretic
 models and models with limited dependent variables, interval‐valued data,
 errors‐in‐variables, or combinations thereof. Both point‐ and
 set‐identified models are transparently covered. In the latter case, the
 method also complements the recent literature on generic set‐inference
 methods by providing the moment conditions needed to construct a
 generalized method of moments‐type objective function for a wide class of
 models. Extensions of the method that cover conditional moments,
 independence restrictions, and some state‐space models are also given.

Title: Islamic Rule and the Empowerment of the Poor and Pious 
Author-Name: Erik Meyersson  
Abstract:
  Does Islamic political control affect women's empowerment? Several
 countries have recently experienced Islamic parties coming to power
 through democratic elections. Due to strong support among religious
 conservatives, constituencies with Islamic rule often tend to exhibit poor
 women's rights. Whether this reflects a causal relationship or a spurious
 one has so far gone unexplored. I provide the first piece of evidence
 using a new and unique data set of Turkish municipalities. In 1994, an
 Islamic party won multiple municipal mayor seats across the country. Using
 a regression discontinuity (RD) design, I compare municipalities where
 this Islamic party barely won or lost elections. Despite negative raw
 correlations, the RD results reveal that, over a period of six years,
 Islamic rule increased female secular high school education. Corresponding
 effects for men are systematically smaller and less precise. In the longer
 run, the effect on female education remained persistent up to 17 years
 after, and also reduced adolescent marriages. An analysis of long‐run
 political effects of Islamic rule shows increased female political
 participation and an overall decrease in Islamic political preferences.
 The results are consistent with an explanation that emphasizes the Islamic
 party's effectiveness in overcoming barriers to female entry for the poor
 and pious.
