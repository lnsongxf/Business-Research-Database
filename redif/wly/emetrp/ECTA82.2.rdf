Title: Dynamic Preference for Flexibility 
Author-Name: R. Vijay Krishna  
Author-Name: Philipp Sadowski  
Abstract:
  We consider a decision maker who faces dynamic decision situations that
 involve intertemporal trade‐offs, as in consumption–savings problems, and
 who experiences taste shocks that are transient contingent on the state of
 the world. We axiomatize a recursive representation of choice over state
 contingent infinite horizon consumption problems, where uncertainty about
 consumption utilities depends on the observable state and the state
 follows a subjective Markov process. The parameters of the representation
 are the subjective process that governs the evolution of beliefs over
 consumption utilities and the discount factor; they are uniquely
 identified from behavior. We characterize a natural notion of greater
 preference for flexibility in terms of a dilation of beliefs. An important
 special case of our representation is a recursive version of the
 Anscombe–Aumann model with parameters that include a subjective Markov
 process over states and state‐dependent utilities, all of which are
 uniquely identified.

Title: Hazardous Times for Monetary Policy: What Do Twenty‐Three Million Bank Loans Say About the Effects of Monetary Policy on Credit Risk‐Taking? 
Author-Name: Gabriel Jiménez  
Author-Name: Steven Ongena  
Author-Name: José‐Luis Peydró  
Author-Name: Jesús Saurina  
Abstract:
  We identify the effects of monetary policy on credit risk‐taking with an
 exhaustive credit register of loan applications and contracts. We separate
 the changes in the composition of the supply of credit from the concurrent
 changes in the volume of supply and quality, and the volume of demand. We
 employ a two‐stage model that analyzes the granting of loan applications
 in the first stage and loan outcomes for the applications granted in the
 second stage, and that controls for both observed and unobserved,
 time‐varying, firm and bank heterogeneity through time firm and time bank
 fixed effects. We find that a lower overnight interest rate induces lowly
 capitalized banks to grant more loan applications to ex ante risky firms
 and to commit larger loan volumes with fewer collateral requirements to
 these firms, yet with a higher ex post likelihood of default. A lower
 long‐term interest rate and other relevant macroeconomic variables have no
 such effects.

Title: Dynamic Mechanism Design: A Myersonian Approach 
Author-Name: Alessandro Pavan  
Author-Name: Ilya Segal  
Author-Name: Juuso Toikka  
Abstract:
  We study mechanism design in dynamic quasilinear environments where
 private information arrives over time and decisions are made over multiple
 periods. We make three contributions. First, we provide a necessary
 condition for incentive compatibility that takes the form of an envelope
 formula for the derivative of an agent's equilibrium expected payoff with
 respect to his current type. It combines the familiar marginal effect of
 types on payoffs with novel marginal effects of the current type on future
 ones that are captured by “impulse response functions.” The formula yields
 an expression for dynamic virtual surplus that is instrumental to the
 design of optimal mechanisms and to the study of distortions under such
 mechanisms. Second, we characterize the transfers that satisfy the
 envelope formula and establish a sense in which they are pinned down by
 the allocation rule (“revenue equivalence”). Third, we characterize
 perfect Bayesian equilibrium‐implementable allocation rules in Markov
 environments, which yields tractable sufficient conditions that facilitate
 novel applications. We illustrate the results by applying them to the
 design of optimal mechanisms for the sale of experience goods (“bandit
 auctions”).

Title: Identifying Treatment Effects Under Data Combination 
Author-Name: Yanqin Fan  
Author-Name: Robert Sherman  
Author-Name: Matthew Shum  
Abstract:
  We consider the identification of counterfactual distributions and
 treatment effects when the outcome variables and conditioning covariates
 are observed in separate data sets. Under the standard selection on
 observables assumption, the counterfactual distributions and treatment
 effect parameters are no longer point identified. However, applying the
 classical monotone rearrangement inequality, we derive sharp bounds on the
 counterfactual distributions and policy parameters of interest.

Title: Non‐Manipulable House Allocation With Rent Control 
Author-Name: Tommy Andersson  
Author-Name: Lars‐Gunnar Svensson  
Abstract:
  In many real‐life house allocation problems, rents are bounded from above
 by price ceilings imposed by a government or a local administration. This
 is known as rent control. Because some price equilibria may be
 disqualified given such restrictions, this paper proposes an alternative
 equilibrium concept, called rationing price equilibrium, tailored to
 capture the specific features of housing markets with rent control. An
 allocation rule that always selects a rationing price equilibrium is
 defined, and it is demonstrated to be constrained efficient and (group)
 non‐manipulable for “almost all” preference profiles. In its bounding
 cases, the rule reduces to a number of well‐known mechanisms from the
 matching literature. In this sense, the housing market with rent control
 investigated in this paper integrates several of the predominant matching
 models into a more general framework.

Title: Stable Matching With Incomplete Information 
Author-Name: Qingmin Liu  
Author-Name: George J. Mailath  
Author-Name: Andrew Postlewaite  
Author-Name: Larry Samuelson  
Abstract:
  We formulate a notion of stable outcomes in matching problems with
 one‐sided asymmetric information. The key conceptual problem is to
 formulate a notion of a blocking pair that takes account of the inferences
 that the uninformed agent might make. We show that the set of stable
 outcomes is nonempty in incomplete‐information environments, and is a
 superset of the set of complete‐information stable outcomes. We then
 provide sufficient conditions for incomplete‐information stable matchings
 to be efficient. Lastly, we define a notion of price‐sustainable
 allocations and show that the set of incomplete‐information stable
 matchings is a subset of the set of such allocations.

Title: Preference Aggregation With Incomplete Information 
Author-Name: Christopher P. Chambers  
Author-Name: Takashi Hayashi  
Abstract:
  We show in an environment of incomplete information that monotonicity and
 the Pareto property applied only when there is common knowledge of Pareto
 dominance imply (i) there must exist a common prior over the smallest
 common knowledge event, and (ii) aggregation must be ex ante and ex post
 utilitarian with respect to that common prior and individual von
 Neumann–Morgenstern utility indices.

Title: Optimal Test for Markov Switching Parameters 
Author-Name: Marine Carrasco  
Author-Name: Liang Hu  
Author-Name: Werner Ploberger  
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a class of optimal tests for the constancy of
 parameters in random coefficients models. Our testing procedure covers the
 class of Hamilton's models, where the parameters vary according to an
 unobservable Markov chain, but also applies to nonlinear models where the
 random coefficients need not be Markov. We show that the contiguous
 alternatives converge to the null hypothesis at a rate that is slower than
 the standard rate. Therefore, standard approaches do not apply. We use
 Bartlett‐type identities for the construction of the test statistics. This
 has several desirable properties. First, it only requires estimating the
 model under the null hypothesis where the parameters are constant. Second,
 the proposed test is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it maximizes
 a weighted power function. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our
 test under the null and local alternatives. Asymptotically valid bootstrap
 critical values are also proposed.

Title: Returns to Tenure or Seniority? 
Author-Name: I. Sebastian Buhai  
Author-Name: Miguel A. Portela  
Author-Name: Coen N. Teulings  
Author-Name: Aico van Vuuren  
Abstract:
  This study documents two empirical facts using matched employer–employee
 data for Denmark and Portugal. First, workers who are hired last, are the
 first to leave the firm. Second, workers' wages rise with seniority, where
 seniority is defined as a worker's tenure relative to the tenure of his
 colleagues. Controlling for tenure, the probability of a worker leaving
 the firm decreases with seniority. The increase in expected seniority with
 tenure explains a large part of the negative duration dependence of the
 separation hazard. Conditional on ten years of tenure, the wage
 differential between the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the seniority
 distribution is 1.1–1.4 percentage points in Denmark and 2.3–3.4 in
 Portugal.

Title: Macroeconomic Implications of Agglomeration 
Author-Name: Morris A. Davis  
Author-Name: Jonas D. M. Fisher  
Author-Name: Toni M. Whited  
Abstract:
  Cities exist because of the productivity gains that arise from clustering
 production and workers, a process called agglomeration. How important is
 agglomeration for aggregate growth? This paper constructs a dynamic
 stochastic general equilibrium model of cities and uses it to estimate the
 effect of local agglomeration on aggregate growth. We combine aggregate
 time‐series and city‐level panel data to estimate the model's parameters
 via generalized method of moments. The estimates imply a statistically and
 economically significant impact of local agglomeration on the growth rate
 of per capita consumption, raising it by about 10%.

Title: Local Identification of Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models 
Author-Name: Xiaohong Chen  
Author-Name: Victor Chernozhukov  
Author-Name: Sokbae Lee  
Author-Name: Whitney K. Newey  
Abstract:
  In parametric, nonlinear structural models, a classical sufficient
 condition for local identification, like Fisher (1966) and Rothenberg
 (1971), is that the vector of moment conditions is differentiable at the
 true parameter with full rank derivative matrix. We derive an analogous
 result for the nonparametric, nonlinear structural models, establishing
 conditions under which an infinite dimensional analog of the full rank
 condition is sufficient for local identification. Importantly, we show
 that additional conditions are often needed in nonlinear, nonparametric
 models to avoid nonlinearities overwhelming linear effects. We give
 restrictions on a neighborhood of the true value that are sufficient for
 local identification. We apply these results to obtain new, primitive
 identification conditions in several important models, including
 nonseparable quantile instrumental variable (IV) models and semiparametric
 consumption‐based asset pricing models.
