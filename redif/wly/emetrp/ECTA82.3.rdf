Title: Residential Location, Work Location, and Labor Market Outcomes of Immigrants in Israel 
Author-Name: Moshe Buchinsky  
Author-Name: Chemi Gotlibovski  
Author-Name: Osnat Lifshitz  
Abstract:
  We develop and estimate a comprehensive dynamic programming (DP) model
 for the joint decisions of residential location, employment location,
 occupational choices, and labor market outcomes. We use data on immigrants
 from the former Soviet Union (FSU). We provide an extensive empirical
 evaluation of policies that have been designed to affect the residential
 and employment location decisions of the migrant population. The results
 shed new, and important, light on several issues regarding this group of
 immigrants. We find large regional differences in wages for the
 white‐collar workers, but only little differences for the blue‐collar
 workers. A careful examination of a number of policy measures indicate
 that a direct subsidy, in the form of a lump‐sum transfer, is most
 effective in achieving the government stated goal of inducing people to
 reside in the northern region of the Galilee and southern region of the
 Negev. Other policies, such as rental and wage subsidies, can also be
 quite effective, but these are more difficult to administer.

Title: Trade Liberalization and Labor Market Dynamics 
Author-Name: Rafael Dix‐Carneiro  
Abstract:
  This paper estimates a structural dynamic equilibrium model of the
 Brazilian labor market in order to study trade‐induced transitional
 dynamics. The model features a multi‐sector economy with overlapping
 generations, heterogeneous workers, endogenous accumulation of
 sector‐specific experience, and costly switching of sectors. The model's
 estimates yield median costs of mobility ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 times
 annual average wages, but a high dispersion of these costs across the
 population. In addition, sector‐specific experience is imperfectly
 transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility.
 Using the estimated model for counterfactual trade liberalization
 experiments, the main findings are: (1) there is a large labor market
 response following trade liberalization but the transition may take
 several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are significantly
 reduced due to the delayed adjustment; (3) trade‐induced welfare effects
 depend on initial sector of employment and on worker demographics such as
 age and education. The experiments also highlight the sensitivity of the
 transitional dynamics with respect to assumptions regarding the mobility
 of capital.

Title: Stochastic Choice and Consideration Sets 
Author-Name: Paola Manzini  
Author-Name: Marco Mariotti  
Abstract:
  We model a boundedly rational agent who suffers from limited attention.
 The agent considers each feasible alternative with a given (unobservable)
 probability, the attention parameter, and then chooses the alternative
 that maximizes a preference relation within the set of considered
 alternatives. We show that this random choice rule is the only one for
 which the impact of removing an alternative on the choice probability of
 any other alternative is asymmetric and menu independent. Both the
 preference relation and the attention parameters are identified uniquely
 by stochastic choice data.

Title: Certifiable Pre‐Play Communication: Full Disclosure 
Author-Name: Jeanne Hagenbach  
Author-Name: Frédéric Koessler  
Author-Name: Eduardo Perez‐Richet  
Abstract:
  This article asks when communication with certifiable information leads
 to complete information revelation. We consider Bayesian games augmented
 by a pre‐play communication phase in which announcements are made
 publicly. We first characterize the augmented games in which there exists
 a fully revealing sequential equilibrium with extremal beliefs (i.e., any
 deviation is attributed to a single type of the deviator). Next, we define
 a class of games for which existence of a fully revealing equilibrium is
 equivalent to a richness property of the evidence structure. This
 characterization enables us to provide different sets of sufficient
 conditions for full information disclosure that encompass and extend all
 known results in the literature, and are easily applicable. We use these
 conditions to obtain new insights in games with strategic
 complementarities, voting with deliberation, and persuasion games with
 multidimensional types.

Title: On Confidence Intervals for Autoregressive Roots and Predictive Regression 
Author-Name: Peter C. B. Phillips  
Abstract:
  Local to unity limit theory is used in applications to construct
 confidence intervals (CIs) for autoregressive roots through inversion of a
 unit root test (Stock (1991)). Such CIs are asymptotically valid when the
 true model has an autoregressive root that is local to unity (ρ = 1 +
 c/n), but are shown here to be invalid at the limits of the domain of
 definition of the localizing coefficient c because of a failure in
 tightness and the escape of probability mass. Failure at the boundary
 implies that these CIs have zero asymptotic coverage probability in the
 stationary case and vicinities of unity that are wider than
 O(n-super-−1/3). The inversion methods of Hansen (1999) and Mikusheva
 (2007) are asymptotically valid in such cases. Implications of these
 results for predictive regression tests are explored. When the predictive
 regressor is stationary, the popular Campbell and Yogo (2006) CIs for the
 regression coefficient have zero coverage probability asymptotically, and
 their predictive test statistic Q erroneously indicates predictability
 with probability approaching unity when the null of no predictability
 holds. These results have obvious cautionary implications for the use of
 the procedures in empirical practice.

Title: How Portable Is Level‐0 Behavior? A Test of Level‐k Theory in Games With Non‐Neutral Frames 
Author-Name: Shaun Hargreaves Heap  
Author-Name: David Rojo Arjona  
Author-Name: Robert Sugden  
Abstract:
  We test the portability of level‐0 assumptions in level‐k theory in an
 experimental investigation of behavior in Coordination, Discoordination,
 and Hide and Seek games with common, non‐neutral frames. Assuming that
 level‐0 behavior depends only on the frame, we derive hypotheses that are
 independent of prior assumptions about salience. Those hypotheses are not
 confirmed. Our findings contrast with previous research which has fitted
 parameterized level‐k models to Hide and Seek data. We show that, as a
 criterion of successful explanation, the existence of a plausible model
 that replicates the main patterns in these data has a high probability of
 false positives.

Title: Decentralized Trading With Private Information 
Author-Name: Mikhail Golosov  
Author-Name: Guido Lorenzoni  
Author-Name: Aleh Tsyvinski  
Abstract:
  The paper studies how asset prices are determined in a decentralized
 market with asymmetric information about asset values. We consider an
 economy in which a large number of agents trade two assets in bilateral
 meetings. A fraction of the agents has private information about the asset
 values. We show that, over time, uninformed agents can elicit information
 from their trading partners by making small offers. This form of
 experimentation allows the uninformed agents to acquire information as
 long as there are potential gains from trade in the economy. As a
 consequence, the economy converges to a Pareto efficient allocation.

Title: Dynamic Financial Constraints: Distinguishing Mechanism Design From Exogenously Incomplete Regimes 
Author-Name: Alexander Karaivanov  
Author-Name: Robert M. Townsend  
Abstract:
  We formulate and solve a range of dynamic models of constrained
 credit/insurance that allow for moral hazard and limited commitment. We
 compare them to full insurance and exogenously incomplete financial
 regimes (autarky, saving only, borrowing and lending in a single asset).
 We develop computational methods based on mechanism design, linear
 programming, and maximum likelihood to estimate, compare, and
 statistically test these alternative dynamic models with
 financial/information constraints. Our methods can use both
 cross‐sectional and panel data and allow for measurement error and
 unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate the models using data on Thai
 households running small businesses from two separate samples. We find
 that in the rural sample, the exogenously incomplete saving only and
 borrowing regimes provide the best fit using data on consumption, business
 assets, investment, and income. Family and other networks help consumption
 smoothing there, as in a moral hazard constrained regime. In contrast, in
 urban areas, we find mechanism design financial/information regimes that
 are decidedly less constrained, with the moral hazard model fitting best
 combined business and consumption data. We perform numerous robustness
 checks in both the Thai data and in Monte Carlo simulations and compare
 our maximum likelihood criterion with results from other metrics and data
 not used in the estimation. A prototypical counterfactual policy
 evaluation exercise using the estimation results is also featured.

Title: Democracy, Redistribution, and Political Participation: Evidence From Sweden 1919–1938 
Author-Name: Björn Tyrefors Hinnerich  
Author-Name: Per Pettersson‐Lidbom  
Abstract:
  In this paper, we compare how two different types of political
 regimes—direct versus representative democracy—redistribute income toward
 the relatively poor segments of society after the introduction of
 universal and equal suffrage. Swedish local governments are used as a
 testing ground since this setting offers a number of attractive features
 for a credible impact evaluation. Most importantly, we exploit the
 existence of a population threshold, which partly determined a local
 government's choice of democracy to implement a regression‐discontinuity
 design. The results indicate that direct democracies spend 40–60 percent
 less on public welfare. Our interpretation is that direct democracy may be
 more prone to elite capture than representative democracy since the
 elite's potential to exercise de facto power is likely to be greater in
 direct democracy after democratization.
