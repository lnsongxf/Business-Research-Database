Title: A Model of the Consumption Response to Fiscal Stimulus Payments 
Author-Name: Greg Kaplan  
Author-Name: Giovanni L. Violante  
Abstract:
  A wide body of empirical evidence finds that approximately 25 percent of
 fiscal stimulus payments (e.g., tax rebates) are spent on nondurable
 household consumption in the quarter that they are received. To interpret
 this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can
 hold two assets: a low‐return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account)
 and a high‐return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g.,
 housing, retirement account). The optimal life‐cycle pattern of portfolio
 choice implies that many households in the model are “wealthy
 hand‐to‐mouth”: they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning
 sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large
 propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small
 propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the
 existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances.
 A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields
 consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with
 the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard
 “one‐asset” framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the
 rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have
 implications for policy design.

Title: Preemptive Policy Experimentation 
Author-Name: Steven Callander  
Author-Name: Patrick Hummel  
Abstract:
  We develop a model of experimentation and learning in policymaking when
 control of power is temporary. We demonstrate how an early office holder
 who would otherwise not experiment is nonetheless induced to experiment
 when his hold on power is temporary. This preemptive policy experiment is
 profitable for the early office holder as it reveals information about the
 policy mapping to his successor, information that shapes future policy
 choices. Thus policy choices today can cast a long shadow over future
 choices purely through information transmission and absent any formal
 institutional constraints or real state variables. The model we develop
 utilizes a recent innovation that represents the policy mapping as the
 realized path of a Brownian motion. We provide a precise characterization
 of when preemptive experimentation emerges in equilibrium and the form it
 takes. We apply the model to several well known episodes of policymaking,
 reinterpreting the policy choices as preemptive experiments.

Title: How Responsive Is Investment in Schooling to Changes in Redistributive Policies and in Returns? 
Author-Name: Ran Abramitzky  
Author-Name: Victor Lavy  
Abstract:
  This paper uses an unusual pay reform to test the responsiveness of
 investment in schooling to changes in redistribution schemes that increase
 the rate of return to education. We exploit an episode where different
 Israeli kibbutzim shifted from equal sharing to productivity‐based wages
 in different years and find that students in kibbutzim that reformed
 earlier invested more in high school education and, in the long run, also
 in post‐secondary schooling. We further show that the effect is mainly
 driven by students in kibbutzim that reformed to a larger degree. Our
 findings support the prediction that education is highly responsive to
 changes in the redistribution policy.

Title: Endogenous Liquidity and Defaultable Bonds 
Author-Name: Zhiguo He  
Author-Name: Konstantin Milbradt  
Abstract:
  This paper studies the interaction between default and liquidity for
 corporate bonds that are traded in an over‐the‐counter secondary market
 with search frictions. Bargaining with dealers determines a bond's
 endogenous liquidity, which depends on both the firm fundamental and the
 time‐to‐maturity of the bond. Corporate default decisions interact with
 the endogenous secondary market liquidity via the rollover channel. A
 default‐liquidity loop arises: Assuming a relative illiquid secondary bond
 market in default, earlier endogenous default worsens a bond's secondary
 market liquidity, which amplifies equity holders' rollover losses, which
 in turn leads to earlier endogenous default. Besides characterizing in
 closed form the full interdependence between liquidity and default for
 credit spreads, our calibrated model can jointly match empirically
 observed credit spreads and liquidity measures of bonds across different
 rating classes.

Title: Firms, Destinations, and Aggregate Fluctuations 
Author-Name: Julian di Giovanni  
Author-Name: Andrei A. Levchenko  
Author-Name: Isabelle Mejean  
Abstract:
  This paper uses a data base covering the universe of French firms for the
 period 1990–2007 to provide a forensic account of the role of individual
 firms in generating aggregate fluctuations. We set up a simple multisector
 model of heterogeneous firms selling to multiple markets to motivate a
 theoretically founded decomposition of firms' annual sales growth rate
 into different components. We find that the firm‐specific component
 contributes substantially to aggregate sales volatility, mattering about
 as much as the components capturing shocks that are common across firms
 within a sector or country. We then decompose the firm‐specific component
 to provide evidence on two mechanisms that generate aggregate fluctuations
 from microeconomic shocks highlighted in the recent literature: (i) when
 the firm size distribution is fat‐tailed, idiosyncratic shocks to large
 firms directly contribute to aggregate fluctuations, and (ii) aggregate
 fluctuations can arise from idiosyncratic shocks due to input–output
 linkages across the economy. Firm linkages are approximately three times
 as important as the direct effect of firm shocks in driving aggregate
 fluctuations.

Title: No‐Betting‐Pareto Dominance 
Author-Name: Itzhak Gilboa  
Author-Name: Larry Samuelson  
Author-Name: David Schmeidler  
Abstract:
  We argue that the notion of Pareto dominance is not as compelling in the
 presence of uncertainty as it is under certainty. In particular, voluntary
 trade based on differences in tastes is commonly accepted as desirable,
 because tastes cannot be wrong. By contrast, voluntary trade based on
 incompatible beliefs may indicate that at least one agent entertains
 mistaken beliefs. We propose and characterize a weaker, No‐Betting, notion
 of Pareto domination which requires, on top of unanimity of preference,
 the existence of shared beliefs that can rationalize such preference for
 each agent.

Title: Complex Questionnaires 
Author-Name: Jacob Glazer  
Author-Name: Ariel Rubinstein  
Abstract:
  We study a principal–agent model in which the agent is boundedly rational
 in his ability to understand the principal's decision rule. The principal
 wishes to elicit an agent's true profile so as to determine whether or not
 to grant him a certain request. The principal designs a questionnaire and
 commits himself to accepting certain responses. In designing such a
 questionnaire, the principal takes into account the bounded rationality of
 the agent and wishes to reduce the success probability of a dishonest
 agent who is trying to game the system. It is shown that the principal can
 construct a sufficiently complex questionnaire that will allow him to
 respond optimally to agents who tell the truth and at the same time to
 almost eliminate the probability that a dishonest agent will succeed in
 cheating.

Title: Understanding Mechanisms Underlying Peer Effects: Evidence From a Field Experiment on Financial Decisions 
Author-Name: Leonardo Bursztyn  
Author-Name: Florian Ederer  
Author-Name: Bruno Ferman  
Author-Name: Noam Yuchtman  
Abstract:
  Using a high‐stakes field experiment conducted with a financial
 brokerage, we implement a novel design to separately identify two channels
 of social influence in financial decisions, both widely studied
 theoretically. When someone purchases an asset, his peers may also want to
 purchase it, both because they learn from his choice (“social learning”)
 and because his possession of the asset directly affects others' utility
 of owning the same asset (“social utility”). We randomize whether one
 member of a peer pair who chose to purchase an asset has that choice
 implemented, thus randomizing his ability to possess the asset. Then, we
 randomize whether the second member of the pair: (i) receives no
 information about the first member, or (ii) is informed of the first
 member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization
 that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of
 learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no
 information) control group. We find that both social learning and social
 utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects
 on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow‐up survey reveals that
 social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is
 financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report
 updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their
 peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with
 “keeping up with the Joneses” when learning about their peer's possession
 of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms
 underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in
 consumption and investment decisions.

Title: Land Use Regulation and Welfare 
Author-Name: Matthew A. Turner  
Author-Name: Andrew Haughwout  
Author-Name: Wilbert van der Klaauw  
Abstract:
  We evaluate the effect of land use regulation on the value of land and on
 welfare. Our estimates are based on a decomposition of the effects of
 regulation into three components: an own‐lot effect, which reflects the
 cost of regulatory constraints to the owner of a parcel; an external
 effect, which reflects the value of regulatory constraints on one's
 neighbors; a supply effect, which reflects the effect of regulated
 scarcity of developable land. Using this decomposition, we arrive at a
 novel strategy for estimating a plausibly causal effect of land use
 regulation on land value and welfare. This strategy exploits cross‐border
 changes in development, prices, and regulation in regions near municipal
 borders. Our estimates suggest large negative effects of regulation on the
 value of land and welfare in these regions.
