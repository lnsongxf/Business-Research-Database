Title: Fiscal Rules and Discretion Under Persistent Shocks 
Author-Name: Marina Halac  
Author-Name: Pierre Yared  
Abstract:
  This paper studies the optimal level of discretion in policymaking. We
 consider a fiscal policy model where the government has time‐inconsistent
 preferences with a present bias toward public spending. The government
 chooses a fiscal rule to trade off its desire to commit to not overspend
 against its desire to have flexibility to react to privately observed
 shocks to the value of spending. We analyze the optimal fiscal rule when
 the shocks are persistent. Unlike under independent and identically
 distributed shocks, we show that the ex ante optimal rule is not
 sequentially optimal, as it provides dynamic incentives. The ex ante
 optimal rule exhibits history dependence, with high shocks leading to an
 erosion of future fiscal discipline compared to low shocks, which lead to
 the reinstatement of discipline. The implied policy distortions oscillate
 over time given a sequence of high shocks, and can force the government to
 accumulate maximal debt and become immiserated in the long run.

Title: Experimental Games on Networks: Underpinnings of Behavior and Equilibrium Selection 
Author-Name: Gary Charness  
Author-Name: Francesco Feri  
Author-Name: Miguel A. Meléndez‐Jiménez  
Author-Name: Matthias Sutter  
Abstract:
  In this paper, we describe a series of laboratory experiments that
 implement specific examples of a general network structure. Specifically,
 actions are either strategic substitutes or strategic complements, and
 participants have either complete or incomplete information about the
 structure of a random network. Since economic environments typically have
 a considerable degree of complementarity or substitutability, this
 framework applies to a wide variety of settings. We examine behavior and
 equilibrium selection. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, in
 particular with incomplete information. Behavior closely resembles the
 theoretical equilibrium whenever this is unique; when there are multiple
 equilibria, general features of networks, such as connectivity,
 clustering, and the degree of the players, help to predict informed
 behavior in the lab. People appear to be strongly attracted to maximizing
 aggregate payoffs (social efficiency), but there are forces that moderate
 this attraction: (1) people seem content with (in the aggregate) capturing
 only the lion's share of the efficient profits in exchange for reduced
 exposure to loss, and (2) uncertainty about the network structure makes it
 considerably more difficult to coordinate on a demanding, but efficient,
 equilibrium that is typically implemented with complete information.

Title: Underinvestment in a Profitable Technology: The Case of Seasonal Migration in Bangladesh 
Author-Name: Gharad Bryan  
Author-Name: Shyamal Chowdhury  
Author-Name: Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak  
Abstract:
  Hunger during pre‐harvest lean seasons is widespread in the agrarian
 areas of Asia and Sub‐Saharan Africa. We randomly assign an $8.50
 incentive to households in rural Bangladesh to temporarily out‐migrate
 during the lean season. The incentive induces 22% of households to send a
 seasonal migrant, their consumption at the origin increases significantly,
 and treated households are 8–10 percentage points more likely to
 re‐migrate 1 and 3 years after the incentive is removed. These facts can
 be explained qualitatively by a model in which migration is risky,
 mitigating risk requires individual‐specific learning, and some migrants
 are sufficiently close to subsistence that failed migration is very
 costly. We document evidence consistent with this model using
 heterogeneity analysis and additional experimental variation, but
 calibrations with forward‐looking households that can save up to migrate
 suggest that it is difficult for the model to quantitatively match the
 data. We conclude with extensions to the model that could provide a better
 quantitative accounting of the behavior.

Title: Identification in Differentiated Products Markets Using Market Level Data 
Author-Name: Steven T. Berry  
Author-Name: Philip A. Haile  
Abstract:
  We present new identification results for nonparametric models of
 differentiated products markets, using only market level observables. We
 specify a nonparametric random utility discrete choice model of demand
 allowing rich preference heterogeneity, product/market unobservables, and
 endogenous prices. Our supply model posits nonparametric cost functions,
 allows latent cost shocks, and nests a range of standard oligopoly models.
 We consider identification of demand, identification of changes in
 aggregate consumer welfare, identification of marginal costs,
 identification of firms' marginal cost functions, and discrimination
 between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary
 approaches. The first demonstrates identification under the same
 nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for
 identification of regression models. The second treats demand and supply
 in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading to
 constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and
 cost shifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first
 general formalization of Bresnahan's (1982) intuition for empirically
 distinguishing between alternative models of oligopoly competition. From a
 practical perspective, our results clarify the types of instrumental
 variables needed with market level data, including tradeoffs between
 functional form and exclusion restrictions.

Title: Identification Using Stability Restrictions 
Author-Name: Leandro M. Magnusson  
Author-Name: Sophocles Mavroeidis  
Abstract:
  This paper studies inference in models that are identified by moment
 restrictions. We show how instability of the moments can be used
 constructively to improve the identification of structural parameters that
 are stable over time. A leading example is macroeconomic models that are
 immune to the well‐known (Lucas (1976)) critique in the face of policy
 regime shifts. This insight is used to develop novel econometric methods
 that extend the widely used generalized method of moments (GMM). The
 proposed methods yield improved inference on the parameters of the new
 Keynesian Phillips curve.

Title: Mechanism Design With Ambiguous Communication Devices 
Author-Name: Subir Bose  
Author-Name: Ludovic Renou  
Abstract:
  This paper considers mechanism design problems in environments with
 ambiguity‐sensitive individuals. The novel idea is to introduce ambiguity
 in mechanisms so as to exploit the ambiguity sensitivity of individuals.
 Deliberate engineering of ambiguity, through ambiguous mediated
 communication, can allow (partial) implementation of social choice
 functions that are not incentive compatible with respect to prior beliefs.
 We provide a complete characterization of social choice functions
 partially implementable by ambiguous mechanisms.

Title: Random Choice as Behavioral Optimization 
Author-Name: Faruk Gul  
Author-Name: Paulo Natenzon  
Author-Name: Wolfgang Pesendorfer  
Abstract:
  We develop an extension of Luce's random choice model to study violations
 of the weak axiom of revealed preference. We introduce the notion of a
 stochastic preference and show that it implies the Luce model. Then, to
 address well‐known difficulties of the Luce model, we define the attribute
 rule and establish that the existence of a well‐defined stochastic
 preference over attributes characterizes it. We prove that the set of
 attribute rules and random utility maximizers are essentially the same.
 Finally, we show that both the Luce and attribute rules have a unique
 consistent extension to dynamic problems.vskip=‐17.5pt]Author: please

Title: Consistency of Higher Order Risk Preferences 
Author-Name: Cary Deck  
Author-Name: Harris Schlesinger  
Abstract:
  Risk aversion (a second‐order risk preference) is a time‐proven concept
 in economic models of choice under risk. More recently, the higher order
 risk preferences of prudence (third‐order) and temperance (fourth‐order)
 also have been shown to be quite important. While a majority of the
 population seems to exhibit both risk aversion and these higher order risk
 preferences, a significant minority does not. We show how both risk‐averse
 and risk‐loving behaviors might be generated by a simple type of basic
 lottery preference for either (1) combining “good” outcomes with “bad”
 ones, or (2) combining “good with good” and “bad with bad,” respectively.
 We further show that this dichotomy is fairly robust at explaining higher
 order risk attitudes in the laboratory. In addition to our own
 experimental evidence, we take a second look at the extant laboratory
 experiments that measure higher order risk preferences and we find a fair
 amount of support for this dichotomy. Our own experiment also is the first
 to look beyond fourth‐order risk preferences, and we examine risk
 attitudes at even higher orders.

Title: Perceived Ambiguity and Relevant Measures 
Author-Name: Peter Klibanoff  
Author-Name: Sujoy Mukerji  
Author-Name: Kyoungwon Seo  
Abstract:
  We axiomatize preferences that can be represented by a monotonic
 aggregation of subjective expected utilities generated by a utility
 function and some set of i.i.d. probability measures over a product state
 space, S-super-∞. For such preferences, we define relevant measures, show
 that they are treated as if they were the only marginals possibly
 governing the state space, and connect them with the measures appearing in
 the aforementioned representation. These results allow us to interpret
 relevant measures as reflecting part of perceived ambiguity, meaning
 subjective uncertainty about probabilities over states. Under mild
 conditions, we show that increases or decreases in ambiguity aversion
 cannot affect the relevant measures. This property, necessary for the
 conclusion that these measures reflect only perceived ambiguity,
 distinguishes the set of relevant measures from the leading alternative in
 the literature. We apply our findings to a number of well‐known models of
 ambiguity‐sensitive preferences. For each model, we identify the set of
 relevant measures and the implications of comparative ambiguity aversion.

Title: A Practical Two‐Step Method for Testing Moment Inequalities 
Author-Name: Joseph P. Romano  
Author-Name: Azeem M. Shaikh  
Author-Name: Michael Wolf  
Abstract:
  This paper considers the problem of testing a finite number of moment
 inequalities. We propose a two‐step approach. In the first step, a
 confidence region for the moments is constructed. In the second step, this
 set is used to provide information about which moments are “negative.” A
 Bonferonni‐type correction is used to account for the fact that, with some
 probability, the moments may not lie in the confidence region. It is shown
 that the test controls size uniformly over a large class of distributions
 for the observed data. An important feature of the proposal is that it
 remains computationally feasible, even when the number of moments is
 large. The finite‐sample properties of the procedure are examined via a
 simulation study, which demonstrates, among other things, that the
 proposal remains competitive with existing procedures while being
 computationally more attractive.
