Title: The Intrinsic Value of Decision Rights 
Author-Name: Björn Bartling  
Author-Name: Ernst Fehr  
Author-Name: Holger Herz  
Abstract:
  Philosophers, psychologists, and economists have long argued that certain
 decision rights carry not only instrumental value but may also be valuable
 for their own sake. The ideas of autonomy, freedom, and liberty derive
 their intuitive appeal—at least partly—from an assumed positive intrinsic
 value of decision rights. Providing clean evidence for the existence of
 this intrinsic value and measuring its size, however, is intricate. Here,
 we develop a method capable of achieving these goals. The data reveal that
 the large majority of our subjects intrinsically value decision rights
 beyond their instrumental benefit. The intrinsic valuation of decision
 rights has potentially important consequences for corporate governance,
 human resource management, and optimal job design: it may explain why
 managers value power, why employees appreciate jobs with task discretion,
 why individuals sort into self‐employment, and why the reallocation of
 decision rights is often very difficult and cumbersome. Our method and
 results may also prove useful in developing an empirical revealed
 preference foundation for concepts such as “freedom of choice” and
 “individual autonomy.”

Title: Information Frictions in Trade 
Author-Name: Treb Allen  
Abstract:
  It is costly to learn about market conditions elsewhere, especially in
 developing countries. This paper examines how such information frictions
 affect trade. Using data on regional agricultural trade in the
 Philippines, I first document a number of observed patterns in trade flows
 and prices that suggest the presence of information frictions. I then
 incorporate information frictions into a perfect competition trade model
 by embedding a process whereby heterogeneous producers engage in a costly
 sequential search process to determine where to sell their produce. I show
 that introducing information frictions reconciles the theory with the
 observed patterns in the data. Structural estimation of the model finds
 that information frictions are quantitatively important: roughly half the
 observed regional price dispersion is due to information frictions.
 Furthermore, incorporating information frictions improves the
 out‐of‐sample predictive power of the model.

Title: Inferring Labor Income Risk and Partial Insurance From Economic Choices 
Author-Name: Fatih Guvenen  
Author-Name: Anthony A. Smith  
Abstract:
  This paper uses the information contained in the joint dynamics of
 individuals' labor earnings and consumption‐choice decisions to quantify
 both the amount of income risk that individuals face and the extent to
 which they have access to informal insurance against this risk. We
 accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural
 consumption–savings model, in which individuals both learn about the
 nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal
 mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial
 insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth
 rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income
 growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of
 typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints,
 and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing
 indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary model that approximates the
 true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works
 very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive
 findings are that income shocks are moderately persistent, systematic
 differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial
 amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one‐half
 of income shocks are smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these
 findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that
 individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically
 assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.

Title: Forced Coexistence and Economic Development: Evidence From Native American Reservations 
Author-Name: Christian Dippel  
Abstract:
  Studying Native American reservations, and their historical formation, I
 find that their forced integration of autonomous polities into a system of
 shared governance had large negative long‐run consequences, even though
 the affected people were ethnically and linguistically homogenous.
 Reservations that combined multiple sub‐tribal bands when they were formed
 are 30% poorer today, even when conditioning on pre‐reservation political
 traditions. The results hold with tribe fixed effects, identifying only
 off within‐tribe variation across reservations. I also provide estimates
 from an instrumental variable strategy based on historical mining rushes
 that led to exogenously more centralized reservations. Data on the timing
 of economic divergence and on contemporary political conflict suggest that
 the primary mechanism runs from persistent social divisions through the
 quality of local governance to the local economic environment.

Title: Structural Change and the Kaldor Facts in a Growth Model With Relative Price Effects and Non‐Gorman Preferences 
Author-Name: Timo Boppart  
Abstract:
  U.S. data reveal three facts: (1) the share of goods in total expenditure
 declines at a constant rate over time, (2) the price of goods relative to
 services declines at a constant rate over time, and (3) poor households
 spend a larger fraction of their budget on goods than do rich households.
 I provide a macroeconomic model with non‐Gorman preferences that
 rationalizes these facts, along with the aggregate Kaldor facts. The model
 is parsimonious and admits an analytical solution. Its functional form
 allows a decomposition of U.S. structural change into an income and
 substitution effect. Estimates from micro data show each of these effects
 to be of roughly equal importance.

Title: What Explains the 2007–2009 Drop in Employment? 
Author-Name: Atif Mian  
Author-Name: Amir Sufi  
Abstract:
  We show that deterioration in household balance sheets, or the housing
 net worth channel, played a significant role in the sharp decline in U.S.
 employment between 2007 and 2009. Counties with a larger decline in
 housing net worth experience a larger decline in non‐tradable employment.
 This result is not driven by industry‐specific supply‐side shocks,
 exposure to the construction sector, policy‐induced business uncertainty,
 or contemporaneous credit supply tightening. We find little evidence of
 labor market adjustment in response to the housing net worth shock. There
 is no significant expansion of the tradable sector in counties with the
 largest decline in housing net worth. Further, there is little evidence of
 wage adjustment within or emigration out of the hardest hit counties.

Title: Survival versus Profit Maximization in a Dynamic Stochastic Experiment 
Author-Name: Ryan Oprea  
Abstract:
  Subjects in a laboratory experiment withdraw earnings from a cash reserve
 evolving according to an arithmetic Brownian motion in near‐continuous
 time. Aggressive withdrawal policies expose subjects to risk of
 bankruptcy, but the policy that maximizes expected earnings need not
 maximize the odds of survival. When profit maximization is consistent with
 high rates of survival (HS parameters), subjects adjust decisively towards
 the optimum. When survival and profit maximization are sharply at odds (LS
 parameters), subjects persistently (and sub‐optimally) hoard excess cash
 in an evident effort to improve survival rates. The design ensures that
 this hoarding is not due to standard risk aversion. Analysis of
 period‐to‐period adjustments in strategies suggests instead that hoarding
 is due to a widespread bias towards survival in the subject population.
 Robustness treatments varying feedback, parameters, and framing fail to
 eliminate the bias.

Title: Bounded Memory and Biases in Information Processing 
Author-Name: Andrea Wilson  
Abstract:
  Before choosing among two actions with state‐dependent payoffs, a
 Bayesian decision‐maker with a finite memory sees a sequence of
 informative signals, ending each period with fixed chance. He summarizes
 information observed with a finite‐state automaton. I characterize the
 optimal protocol as an equilibrium of a dynamic game of imperfect recall;
 a new player runs each memory state each period. Players act as if
 maximizing expected payoffs in a common finite action decision problem. I
 characterize equilibrium play with many multinomial signals. The optimal
 protocol rationalizes many behavioral phenomena, like “stickiness,”
 salience, confirmation bias, and belief polarization.

Title: Robust Nonparametric Confidence Intervals for Regression‐Discontinuity Designs 
Author-Name: Sebastian Calonico  
Author-Name: Matias D. Cattaneo  
Author-Name: Rocio Titiunik  
Abstract:
  In the regression‐discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to
 treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a
 known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now
 routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment
 effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications,
 however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific
 bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a
 “large” bandwidth, leading to data‐driven confidence intervals that may be
 biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We
 propose new theory‐based, more robust confidence interval estimators for
 average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy
 RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are
 constructed using a bias‐corrected RD estimator together with a novel
 standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean
 squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for
 conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach,
 and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance
 formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts
 to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More
 generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference
 procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator
 employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals
 exhibit close‐to‐correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval
 length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in
 the literature. All results are readily available in <span
 cssStyle="font-family:monospace">R</span> and <span
 cssStyle="font-family:monospace">STATA</span> using our companion software
 packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, 2014b).

Title: Fixed‐Smoothing Asymptotics in a Two‐Step Generalized Method of Moments Framework 
Author-Name: Yixiao Sun  
Abstract:
  This paper develops the fixed‐smoothing asymptotics in a two‐step
 generalized method of moments (GMM) framework. Under this type of
 asymptotics, the weighting matrix in the second‐step GMM criterion
 function converges weakly to a random matrix and the two‐step GMM
 estimator is asymptotically mixed normal. Nevertheless, the Wald
 statistic, the GMM criterion function statistic, and the Lagrange
 multiplier statistic remain asymptotically pivotal. It is shown that
 critical values from the fixed‐smoothing asymptotic distribution are high
 order correct under the conventional increasing‐smoothing asymptotics.
 When an orthonormal series covariance estimator is used, the critical
 values can be approximated very well by the quantiles of a noncentral F
 distribution. A simulation study shows that statistical tests based on the
 new fixed‐smoothing approximation are much more accurate in size than
 existing tests.

Title: Implementation With Contingent Contracts 
Author-Name: Rahul Deb  
Author-Name: Debasis Mishra  
Abstract:
  We study dominant strategy incentive compatibility in a mechanism design
 setting with contingent contracts where the payoff of each agent is
 observed by the principal and can be contracted upon. Our main focus is on
 the class of linear contracts (one of the most commonly used contingent
 contracts) which consist of a transfer and a flat rate of profit sharing.
 We characterize outcomes implementable by linear contracts and provide a
 foundation for them by showing that, in finite type spaces, every social
 choice function that can be implemented using a more general nonlinear
 contingent contract can also be implemented using a linear contract. We
 then qualitatively describe the set of implementable outcomes. We show
 that a general class of social welfare criteria can be implemented. This
 class contains social choice functions (such as the Rawlsian) which cannot
 be implemented using (uncontingent) transfers. Under additional
 conditions, we show that only social choice functions in this class are
 implementable.
