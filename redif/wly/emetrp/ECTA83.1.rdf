Title: Estimation of Nonparametric Models With Simultaneity 
Author-Name: Rosa L. Matzkin  
Abstract:
  We introduce methods for estimating nonparametric, nonadditive models
 with simultaneity. The methods are developed by directly connecting the
 elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the
 density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or
 averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are
 therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of the
 density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model where
 to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive regressor and a
 model with one equation of interest and one instrument that is included in
 a second equation. For both models, we provide new characterizations of
 observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the density of the
 observable variables and derivatives of the structural functions. Based on
 those characterizations, we develop two estimation methods. In the first
 method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated by a
 simple matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, analogous to a standard
 least squares estimator, but with the elements of the matrices being
 averages of products of derivatives of nonparametric density estimators.
 In the second method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are
 calculated in two steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are
 found at which the density of the observable variables satisfies some
 properties. In the second step, the estimators are calculated directly
 from the values of derivatives of the density of the observable variables
 evaluated at the found values of the instrument. We show that both
 pointwise estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal.

Title: Necessity Is the Mother of Invention: Input Supplies and Directed Technical Change 
Author-Name: W. Walker Hanlon  
Abstract:
  This study provides causal evidence that a shock to the relative supply
 of inputs to production can (1) affect the direction of technological
 progress and (2) lead to a rebound in the relative price of the input that
 became relatively more abundant (the strong induced‐bias hypothesis). I
 exploit the impact of the U.S. Civil War on the British cotton textile
 industry, which reduced supplies of cotton from the Southern United
 States, forcing British producers to shift to lower‐quality Indian cotton.
 Using detailed new data, I show that this shift induced the development of
 new technologies that augmented Indian cotton. As these new technologies
 became available, I show that the relative price of Indian/U.S. cotton
 rebounded to its pre‐war level, despite the increased relative supply of
 Indian cotton. This is the first paper to establish both of these patterns
 empirically, lending support to the two key predictions of leading
 directed technical change theories.

Title: Consumption Dynamics During Recessions 
Author-Name: David Berger  
Author-Name: Joseph Vavra  
Abstract:
  Are there times when durable spending is less responsive to economic
 stimulus? We argue that aggregate durable expenditures respond more
 sluggishly to economic shocks during recessions because microeconomic
 frictions lead to declines in the frequency of households' durable
 adjustment. We show this by first using indirect inference to estimate a
 heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model with fixed costs of durable
 adjustment to match consumption dynamics in PSID microdata. We then show
 that aggregating this model delivers an extremely procyclical Impulse
 Response Function (IRF) of durable spending to aggregate shocks. For
 example, the response of durable spending to an income shock in 1999 is
 estimated to be almost twice as large as if it occurred in 2009. This
 procyclical IRF holds in response to standard business cycle shocks as
 well as in response to various policy shocks, and it is robust to general
 equilibrium. After estimating this robust theoretical implication of micro
 frictions, we provide additional direct empirical evidence for its
 importance using both cross‐sectional and time‐series data.

Title: Consumer Heterogeneity and Paid Search Effectiveness: A Large‐Scale Field Experiment 
Author-Name: Thomas Blake  
Author-Name: Chris Nosko  
Author-Name: Steven Tadelis  
Abstract:
  Internet advertising has been the fastest growing advertising channel in
 recent years, with paid search ads comprising the bulk of this revenue. We
 present results from a series of large‐scale field experiments done at
 eBay that were designed to measure the causal effectiveness of paid search
 ads. Because search clicks and purchase intent are correlated, we show
 that returns from paid search are a fraction of non‐experimental
 estimates. As an extreme case, we show that brand keyword ads have no
 measurable short‐term benefits. For non‐brand keywords, we find that new
 and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more
 frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account
 for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that
 are negative.

Title: A Characterization of Rationalizable Consumer Behavior 
Author-Name: Philip J. Reny  
Abstract:
  For an arbitrary data set D = {(p, x)} ⊆ (ℝ<sub>+</sub>-super-m∖ {0}) ×
 ℝ<sub>+</sub>-super-m, finite or infinite, it is shown that the following
 three conditions are equivalent: (a) D satisfies GARP; (b) D can be
 rationalized by a utility function; (c) D can be rationalized by a utility
 function that is quasiconcave, nondecreasing, and that strictly increases
 when all its coordinates strictly increase. Examples of infinite data sets
 satisfying GARP are provided for which every utility rationalization fails
 to be lower semicontinuous, upper semicontinuous, or concave. Thus
 condition (c) cannot be substantively improved upon.

Title: Agency Models With Frequent Actions 
Author-Name: Tomasz Sadzik  
Author-Name: Ennio Stacchetti  
Abstract:
  The paper analyzes dynamic principal–agent models with short period
 lengths. The two main contributions are: (i) an analytic characterization
 of the values of optimal contracts in the limit as the period length goes
 to 0, and (ii) the construction of relatively simple (almost) optimal
 contracts for fixed period lengths. Our setting is flexible and includes
 the pure hidden action or pure hidden information models as special cases.
 We show how such details of the underlying information structure affect
 the optimal provision of incentives and the value of the contracts. The
 dependence is very tractable and we obtain sharp comparative statics
 results. The results are derived with a novel method that uses a quadratic
 approximation of the Pareto boundary of the equilibrium value set.

Title: Time and No Lotteries: An Axiomatization of Maxmin Expected Utility 
Author-Name: Asen Kochov  
Abstract:
  This paper axiomatizes an intertemporal version of the maxmin
 expected‐utility model. It employs two axioms specific to a dynamic
 setting. The first requires that smoothing consumption across states of
 the world is more beneficial to the individual than smoothing consumption
 across time. Such behavior is viewed as the intertemporal manifestation of
 ambiguity aversion. The second axiom extends Koopmans' notion of
 stationarity from deterministic to stochastic environments.

Title: Trade Dynamics in the Market for Federal Funds 
Author-Name: Gara Afonso  
Author-Name: Ricardo Lagos  
Abstract:
  We develop a model of the market for federal funds that explicitly
 accounts for its two distinctive features: banks have to search for a
 suitable counterparty, and once they meet, both parties negotiate the size
 of the loan and the repayment. The theory is used to answer a number of
 positive and normative questions: What are the determinants of the fed
 funds rate? How does the market reallocate funds? Is the market able to
 achieve an efficient reallocation of funds? We also use the model for
 theoretical and quantitative analyses of policy issues facing modern
 central banks.

Abstract:
  This paper provides conditions under which the inequality constraints
 generated by either single agent optimizing behavior or the best response
 condition of multiple agent problems can be used as a basis for estimation
 and inference. An application illustrates how the use of these inequality
 constraints can simplify the analysis of complex behavioral models.

Title: Time Consistency: Stationarity and Time Invariance 
Author-Name: Yoram Halevy  
Abstract:
  A sequence of experiments documents static and dynamic “preference
 reversals” between sooner‐smaller and later‐larger rewards, when the
 sooner reward could be immediate. The theoretically motivated design
 permits separate identification of time consistent, stationary, and time
 invariant choices. At least half of the subjects are time consistent, but
 only three‐quarters of them exhibit stationary choices. About half of
 subjects with time inconsistent choices have stationary preferences. These
 results challenge the view that present‐bias preferences are the main
 source of time inconsistent choices.

Title: Bayesian Learning, Smooth Approximate Optimal Behavior, and Convergence to ε‐Nash Equilibrium 
Author-Name: Yuichi Noguchi  
Abstract:
  In this paper, I construct players' prior beliefs and show that these
 prior beliefs lead the players to learn to play an approximate Nash
 equilibrium uniformly in any infinitely repeated slightly perturbed game
 with discounting and perfect monitoring. That is, given any ε > 0, there
 exists a (single) profile of players' prior beliefs that leads play to
 almost surely converge to an ε‐Nash equilibrium uniformly for any (finite
 normal form) stage game with slight payoff perturbation and any discount
 factor less than 1.

Title: A Comment on “Can Relaxation of Beliefs Rationalize the Winner's Curse?: An Experimental Study”

Author-Name: Makoto Shimoji  
Abstract:
  Ivanov, Levin, and Niederle (2010) use a common‐value second‐price
 auction experiment to reject beliefs‐based explanations for the winner's
 curse. ILN's conclusion, however, stems from the misuse of theoretical
 arguments. Beliefs‐based models are even compatible with some observations
 from ILN's experiment.
