Title: Voting Technology, Political Responsiveness, and Infant Health: Evidence From Brazil 
Author-Name: Thomas Fujiwara  
Abstract:
  This paper studies the introduction of electronic voting technology in
 Brazilian elections. Estimates exploiting a regression discontinuity
 design indicate that electronic voting reduced residual (error‐ridden and
 uncounted) votes and promoted a large de facto enfranchisement of mainly
 less educated citizens. Estimates exploiting the unique pattern of the
 technology's phase‐in across states over time suggest that, as predicted
 by political economy models, it shifted government spending toward health
 care, which is particularly beneficial to the poor. Positive effects on
 both the utilization of health services (prenatal visits) and newborn
 health (low‐weight births) are also found for less educated mothers, but
 not for the more educated.

Title: How Is Power Shared in Africa? 
Author-Name: Patrick Francois  
Author-Name: Ilia Rainer  
Author-Name: Francesco Trebbi  
Abstract:
  Is African politics characterized by concentrated power in the hands of a
 narrow group (ethnically determined) that then fluctuates from one extreme
 to another via frequent coups? Employing data on the ethnicity of cabinet
 ministers since independence, we show that African ruling coalitions are
 surprisingly large and that political power is allocated proportionally to
 population shares across ethnic groups. This holds true even restricting
 the analysis to the subsample of the most powerful ministerial posts. We
 argue that the likelihood of revolutions from outsiders and coup threats
 from insiders are major forces explaining allocations within these
 regimes. Alternative allocation mechanisms are explored. Counterfactual
 experiments that shed light on the role of Western policies in affecting
 African national coalitions and leadership group premia are performed.

Title: Democratization Under the Threat of Revolution: Evidence From the Great Reform Act of 1832 
Author-Name: Toke S. Aidt  
Author-Name: Raphaël Franck  
Abstract:
  We examine the link between the threat of violence and democratization in
 the context of the Great Reform Act passed by the British Parliament in
 1832. We geo‐reference the so‐called Swing riots, which occurred between
 the 1830 and 1831 parliamentary elections, and compute the number of these
 riots that happened within a 10 km radius of the 244 English
 constituencies. Our empirical analysis relates this constituency‐specific
 measure of the threat perceptions held by the 344,000 voters in the
 Unreformed Parliament to the share of seats won in each constituency by
 pro‐reform politicians in 1831. We find that the Swing riots induced
 voters to vote for pro‐reform politicians after experiencing first‐hand
 the violence of the riots.

Title: Sentiments and Aggregate Demand Fluctuations 
Author-Name: Jess Benhabib  
Author-Name: Pengfei Wang  
Author-Name: Yi Wen  
Abstract:
  We formalize the Keynesian insight that aggregate demand driven by
 sentiments can generate output fluctuations under rational expectations.
 When production decisions must be made under imperfect information about
 demand, optimal decisions based on sentiments can generate stochastic
 self‐fulfilling rational expectations equilibria in standard economies
 without persistent informational frictions, externalities, nonconvexities,
 or strategic complementarities in production. The models we consider are
 deliberately simple, but could serve as benchmarks for more complicated
 equilibrium models with additional features.

Title: Time Horizon and Cooperation in Continuous Time 
Author-Name: Maria Bigoni  
Author-Name: Marco Casari  
Author-Name: Andrzej Skrzypacz  
Author-Name: Giancarlo Spagnolo  
Abstract:
  We study social dilemmas in (quasi‐) continuous‐time experiments,
 comparing games with different durations and termination rules. We
 discover a stark qualitative contrast in behavior in continuous time as
 compared to previously studied behavior in discrete‐time games:
 cooperation is easier to achieve and sustain with deterministic horizons
 than with stochastic ones, and end‐game effects emerge, but subjects
 postpone them with experience. Analysis of individual strategies provides
 a basis for a simple reinforcement learning model that proves to be
 consistent with this evidence. An additional treatment lends further
 support to this explanation.

Title: Nonparametric Welfare Analysis for Discrete Choice 
Author-Name: Debopam Bhattacharya  
Abstract:
  We consider empirical measurement of equivalent variation (EV) and
 compensating variation (CV) resulting from price change of a discrete good
 using individual‐level data when there is unobserved heterogeneity in
 preferences. We show that for binary and unordered multinomial choice, the
 marginal distributions of EV and CV can be expressed as simple closed‐form
 functionals of conditional choice probabilities under essentially
 unrestricted preference distributions. These results hold even when the
 distribution and dimension of unobserved heterogeneity are neither known
 nor identified, and utilities are neither quasilinear nor parametrically
 specified. The welfare distributions take simple forms that are easy to
 compute in applications. In particular, average EV for a price rise equals
 the change in average Marshallian consumer surplus and is smaller than
 average CV for a normal good. These nonparametric point‐identification
 results fail for ordered choice if the unit price is identical for all
 alternatives, thereby providing a connection to Hausman–Newey's (2014)
 partial identification results for the limiting case of continuous choice.

Title: Dynamic Logit With Choice Aversion 
Author-Name: Drew Fudenberg  
Author-Name: Tomasz Strzalecki  
Abstract:
  We characterize a generalization of discounted logistic choice that
 incorporates a parameter to capture different views the agent might have
 about the costs and benefits of larger choice sets. The discounted logit
 model used in the empirical literature is the special case that displays a
 “preference for flexibility” in the sense that the agent always prefers to
 add additional items to a menu. Other cases display varying levels of
 “choice aversion,” where the agent prefers to remove items from a menu if
 their ex ante value is below a threshold. We show that higher choice
 aversion, as measured by dislike of bigger menus, also corresponds to an
 increased preference for putting off decisions as late as possible.

Title: Cautious Expected Utility and the Certainty Effect 
Author-Name: Simone Cerreia‐Vioglio  
Author-Name: David Dillenberger  
Author-Name: Pietro Ortoleva  
Abstract:
  Many violations of the independence axiom of expected utility can be
 traced to subjects' attraction to risk‐free prospects. The key axiom in
 this paper, negative certainty independence ([Dillenberger, 2010]),
 formalizes this tendency. Our main result is a utility representation of
 all preferences over monetary lotteries that satisfy negative certainty
 independence together with basic rationality postulates. Such preferences
 can be represented as if the agent were unsure of how to evaluate a given
 lottery p; instead, she has in mind a set of possible utility functions
 over outcomes and displays a cautious behavior: she computes the certainty
 equivalent of p with respect to each possible function in the set and
 picks the smallest one. The set of utilities is unique in a well defined
 sense. We show that our representation can also be derived from a
 “cautious” completion of an incomplete preference relation.

Title: A Polynomial Optimization Approach to Principal–Agent Problems 
Author-Name: Philipp Renner  
Author-Name: Karl Schmedders  
Abstract:
  This paper presents a new method for the analysis of moral hazard
 principal–agent problems. The new approach avoids the stringent
 assumptions on the distribution of outcomes made by the classical
 first‐order approach and instead only requires the agent's expected
 utility to be a rational function of the action. This assumption allows
 for a reformulation of the agent's utility maximization problem as an
 equivalent system of equations and inequalities. This reformulation in
 turn transforms the principal's utility maximization problem into a
 nonlinear program. Under the additional assumptions that the principal's
 expected utility is a polynomial and the agent's expected utility is
 rational in the wage, the final nonlinear program can be solved to global
 optimality. The paper also shows how to first approximate expected utility
 functions that are not rational by polynomials, so that the polynomial
 optimization approach can be applied to compute an approximate solution to
 nonpolynomial problems. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the
 polynomial optimization approach extends to principal–agent models with
 multidimensional action sets.

Title: Nearly Optimal Tests When a Nuisance Parameter Is Present Under the Null Hypothesis 
Author-Name: Graham Elliott  
Author-Name: Ulrich K. Müller  
Author-Name: Mark W. Watson  
Abstract:
  This paper considers nonstandard hypothesis testing problems that involve
 a nuisance parameter. We establish an upper bound on the weighted average
 power of all valid tests, and develop a numerical algorithm that
 determines a feasible test with power close to the bound. The approach is
 illustrated in six applications: inference about a linear regression
 coefficient when the sign of a control coefficient is known; small sample
 inference about the difference in means from two independent Gaussian
 samples from populations with potentially different variances; inference
 about the break date in structural break models with moderate break
 magnitude; predictability tests when the regressor is highly persistent;
 inference about an interval identified parameter; and inference about a
 linear regression coefficient when the necessity of a control is in doubt.

Title: Bootstrap Testing of Hypotheses on Co‐Integration Relations in Vector Autoregressive Models 
Author-Name: Giuseppe Cavaliere  
Author-Name: Heino Bohn Nielsen  
Author-Name: Anders Rahbek  
Abstract:
  It is well known that the finite‐sample properties of tests of hypotheses
 on the co‐integrating vectors in vector autoregressive models can be quite
 poor, and that current solutions based on Bartlett‐type corrections or
 bootstrap based on unrestricted parameter estimators are unsatisfactory,
 in particular in those cases where also asymptotic χ-super-2 tests fail
 most severely. In this paper, we solve this inference problem by showing
 the novel result that a bootstrap test where the null hypothesis is
 imposed on the bootstrap sample is asymptotically valid. That is, not only
 does it have asymptotically correct size, but, in contrast to what is
 claimed in existing literature, it is consistent under the alternative.
 Compared to the theory for bootstrap tests on the co‐integration rank
 (Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor, 2012), establishing the validity of the
 bootstrap in the framework of hypotheses on the co‐integrating vectors
 requires new theoretical developments, including the introduction of
 multivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes with random (reduced rank) drift
 parameters. Finally, as documented by Monte Carlo simulations, the
 bootstrap test outperforms existing methods.
