Title: Investment and Competitive Matching 
Author-Name: Georg Nöldeke  
Author-Name: Larry Samuelson  
Abstract:
  We study markets in which agents first make investments and are then
 matched into potentially productive partnerships. Equilibrium investments
 and the equilibrium matching will be efficient if agents can
 simultaneously negotiate investments and matches, but we focus on markets
 in which agents must first sink their investments before matching.
 Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk‐investment setting, even
 though our matching market is competitive. These equilibria exhibit
 inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination failures. All
 allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property are equilibria,
 and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a separability condition. We
 identify sufficient conditions (most notably, quasiconcave utilities) for
 the investments of matched agents to satisfy an exchange efficiency
 property as well as sufficient conditions (most notably, a single crossing
 property) for agents to be matched positive assortatively, with these
 conditions then forming the core of sufficient conditions for the
 efficiency of equilibrium allocations.

Title: Large Matching Markets as Two‐Sided Demand Systems 
Author-Name: Konrad Menzel  
Abstract:
  This paper studies two‐sided matching markets with non‐transferable
 utility when the number of market participants grows large. We consider a
 model in which each agent has a random preference ordering over individual
 potential matching partners, and agents' types are only partially observed
 by the econometrician. We show that in a large market, the inclusive value
 is a sufficient statistic for an agent's endogenous choice set with
 respect to the probability of being matched to a spouse of a given
 observable type. Furthermore, while the number of pairwise stable
 matchings for a typical realization of random utilities grows at a fast
 rate as the number of market participants increases, the inclusive values
 resulting from any stable matching converge to a unique deterministic
 limit. We can therefore characterize the limiting distribution of the
 matching market as the unique solution to a fixed‐point condition on the
 inclusive values. Finally we analyze identification and estimation of
 payoff parameters from the asymptotic distribution of observable
 characteristics at the level of pairs resulting from a stable matching.

Title: Tenable Strategy Blocks and Settled Equilibria 
Author-Name: Roger Myerson  
Author-Name: Jörgen Weibull  
Abstract:
  When people interact in familiar settings, social conventions usually
 develop so that people tend to disregard alternatives outside the
 convention. For rational players to usually restrict attention to a block
 of conventional strategies, no player should prefer to deviate from the
 block when others are likely to act conventionally and rationally inside
 the block. We explore two set‐valued concepts, coarsely and finely tenable
 blocks, that formalize this notion for finite normal‐form games. We then
 identify settled equilibria, which are Nash equilibria with support in
 minimal tenable blocks. For a generic class of normal‐form games, our
 coarse and fine concepts are equivalent, and yet they differ from standard
 solution concepts on open sets of games. We demonstrate the nature and
 power of the solutions by way of examples. Settled equilibria are closely
 related to persistent equilibria but are strictly more selective on an
 open set of games. With fine tenability, we obtain invariance under the
 insertion of a subgame with a unique totally mixed payoff‐equivalent
 equilibrium, a property that other related concepts have not satisfied.

Title: The Farsighted Stable Set 
Author-Name: Debraj Ray  
Author-Name: Rajiv Vohra  
Abstract:
  Harsanyi (1974) criticized the von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM) stable set
 for its presumption that coalitions are myopic about their prospects. He
 proposed a new dominance relation incorporating farsightedness, but
 retained another feature of the stable set: that a coalition S can impose
 any imputation as long as its restriction to S is feasible for it. This
 implicitly gives an objecting coalition complete power to arrange the
 payoffs of players elsewhere, which is clearly unsatisfactory. While this
 assumption is largely innocuous for myopic dominance, it is of crucial
 significance for its farsighted counterpart. Our modification of the
 Harsanyi set respects “coalitional sovereignty.” The resulting farsighted
 stable set is very different from both the Harsanyi and the vNM sets. We
 provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a
 farsighted stable set containing just a single‐payoff allocation. This
 condition roughly establishes an equivalence between core allocations and
 the union of allocations over all single‐payoff farsighted stable sets. We
 then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existence and structure of
 farsighted stable sets in simple games. This last exercise throws light on
 both single‐payoff and multi‐payoff stable sets, and suggests that they do
 not coexist.

Title: Sieve Wald and QLR Inferences on Semi/Nonparametric Conditional Moment Models 
Author-Name: Xiaohong Chen  
Author-Name: Demian Pouzo  
Abstract:
  This paper considers inference on functionals of semi/nonparametric
 conditional moment restrictions with possibly nonsmooth generalized
 residuals, which include all of the (nonlinear) nonparametric instrumental
 variables (IV) as special cases. These models are often ill‐posed and
 hence it is difficult to verify whether a (possibly nonlinear) functional
 is root‐n estimable or not. We provide computationally simple, unified
 inference procedures that are asymptotically valid regardless of whether a
 functional is root‐n estimable or not. We establish the following new
 useful results: (1) the asymptotic normality of a plug‐in penalized sieve
 minimum distance (PSMD) estimator of a (possibly nonlinear) functional;
 (2) the consistency of simple sieve variance estimators for the plug‐in
 PSMD estimator, and hence the asymptotic chi‐square distribution of the
 sieve Wald statistic; (3) the asymptotic chi‐square distribution of an
 optimally weighted sieve quasi likelihood ratio (QLR) test under the null
 hypothesis; (4) the asymptotic tight distribution of a non‐optimally
 weighted sieve QLR statistic under the null; (5) the consistency of
 generalized residual bootstrap sieve Wald and QLR tests; (6) local power
 properties of sieve Wald and QLR tests and of their bootstrap versions;
 (7) asymptotic properties of sieve Wald and SQLR for functionals of
 increasing dimension. Simulation studies and an empirical illustration of
 a nonparametric quantile IV regression are presented.

Title: Parametric Inference and Dynamic State Recovery From Option Panels 
Author-Name: Torben G. Andersen  
Author-Name: Nicola Fusari  
Author-Name: Viktor Todorov  
Abstract:
  We develop a new parametric estimation procedure for option panels
 observed with error. We exploit asymptotic approximations assuming an ever
 increasing set of option prices in the moneyness (cross‐sectional)
 dimension, but with a fixed time span. We develop consistent estimators
 for the parameters and the dynamic realization of the state vector
 governing the option price dynamics. The estimators converge stably to a
 mixed‐Gaussian law and we develop feasible estimators for the limiting
 variance. We also provide semiparametric tests for the option price
 dynamics based on the distance between the spot volatility extracted from
 the options and one constructed nonparametrically from high‐frequency data
 on the underlying asset. Furthermore, we develop new tests for the
 day‐by‐day model fit over specific regions of the volatility surface and
 for the stability of the risk‐neutral dynamics over time. A comprehensive
 Monte Carlo study indicates that the inference procedures work well in
 empirically realistic settings. In an empirical application to S&P 500
 index options, guided by the new diagnostic tests, we extend existing
 asset pricing models by allowing for a flexible dynamic relation between
 volatility and priced jump tail risk. Importantly, we document that the
 priced jump tail risk typically responds in a more pronounced and
 persistent manner than volatility to large negative market shocks.

Title: Grouped Patterns of Heterogeneity in Panel Data 
Author-Name: Stéphane Bonhomme  
Author-Name: Elena Manresa  
Abstract:
  This paper introduces time‐varying grouped patterns of heterogeneity in
 linear panel data models. A distinctive feature of our approach is that
 group membership is left unrestricted. We estimate the parameters of the
 model using a “grouped fixed‐effects” estimator that minimizes a least
 squares criterion with respect to all possible groupings of the
 cross‐sectional units. Recent advances in the clustering literature allow
 for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our
 estimator is consistent as both dimensions of the panel tend to infinity,
 and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns
 of unobserved heterogeneity in the study of the link between income and
 democracy across countries.

Title: Identification of Nonseparable Models Using Instruments With Small Support 
Author-Name: Alexander Torgovitsky  
Abstract:
  I consider nonparametric identification of nonseparable instrumental
 variables models with continuous endogenous variables. If both the outcome
 and first stage equations are strictly increasing in a scalar
 unobservable, then many kinds of continuous, discrete, and even binary
 instruments can be used to point‐identify the levels of the outcome
 equation. This contrasts sharply with related work by Imbens and Newey,
 2009 that requires continuous instruments with large support. One
 implication is that assumptions about the dimension of heterogeneity can
 provide nonparametric point‐identification of the distribution of
 treatment response for a continuous treatment in a randomized controlled
 experiment with partial compliance.

Title: Identification of Nonseparable Triangular Models With Discrete Instruments 
Author-Name: Xavier D'Haultfœuille  
Author-Name: Philippe Février  
Abstract:
  We study the identification through instruments of a nonseparable
 function that relates a continuous outcome to a continuous endogenous
 variable. Using group and dynamical systems theories, we show that full
 identification can be achieved under strong exogeneity of the instrument
 and a dual monotonicity condition, even if the instrument is discrete.
 When identified, the model is also testable. Our results therefore
 highlight the identifying power of strong exogeneity when combined with
 monotonicity restrictions.

Title: The Economics of Counterfeiting 
Author-Name: Elena Quercioli  
Author-Name: Lones Smith  
Abstract:
  We develop a strategic theory of counterfeiting as a multi‐market large
 game. Bad guys choose whether to counterfeit, and what quality to produce.
 Opposing them is a continuum of good guys who select a costly verification
 effort. In equilibrium, counterfeiters produce better quality at higher
 notes, but verifiers try sufficiently harder that verification still
 improves. We develop a graphical framework for deducing comparative
 statics. Passed and counterfeiting rates vanish for low and high notes.
 Our predictions are consistent with time series and cross‐sectional
 patterns in a unique data set assembled largely from the Secret Service.

Title: Corrigendum to “Discounted Stochastic Games With No Stationary Nash Equilibrium: Two Examples” 
Author-Name: Yehuda John Levy  
Author-Name: Andrew McLennan  
Abstract:
  Levy (2013) presented examples of discounted stochastic games that do not
 have stationary equilibria. The second named author has pointed out that
 one of these examples is incorrect. In addition to describing the details
 of this error, this note presents a new example by the first named author
 that succeeds in demonstrating that discounted stochastic games with
 absolutely continuous transitions can fail to have stationary equilibria.
