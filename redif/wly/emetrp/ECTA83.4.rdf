Title: Equilibria in Health Exchanges: Adverse Selection versus Reclassification Risk 
Author-Name: Ben Handel  
Author-Name: Igal Hendel  
Author-Name: Michael D. Whinston  
Abstract:
  This paper studies regulated health insurance markets known as exchanges,
 motivated by the increasingly important role they play in both public and
 private insurance provision. We develop a framework that combines data on
 health outcomes and insurance plan choices for a population of insured
 individuals with a model of a competitive insurance exchange to predict
 outcomes under different exchange designs. We apply this framework to
 examine the effects of regulations that govern insurers' ability to use
 health status information in pricing. We investigate the welfare
 implications of these regulations with an emphasis on two potential
 sources of inefficiency: (i) adverse selection and (ii) premium
 reclassification risk. We find substantial adverse selection leading to
 full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even when age can be priced.
 While the welfare cost of adverse selection is substantial when health
 status cannot be priced, that of reclassification risk is five times
 larger when insurers can price based on some health status information. We
 investigate several extensions including (i) contract design regulation,
 (ii) self‐insurance through saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk
 adjustment transfers.

Title: Trade Credit and the Propagation of Corporate Failure: An Empirical Analysis 
Author-Name: Tor Jacobson  
Author-Name: Erik Schedvin  
Abstract:
  Using an exhaustive data set on claims held by trade creditors
 (suppliers) on failed trade debtors (customers), we quantify the
 importance of trade credit chains for the propagation of corporate
 bankruptcy. We show that trade creditors experience significant trade
 credit losses due to trade debtor failures and that creditors' bankruptcy
 risks increase in the size of incurred losses. By exploring the roles of
 financial constraints and creditor‐debtor dependences, we infer that the
 trade credit failure propagation mechanism is driven by both credit losses
 and demand shrinkage. Finally, we show that the documented propagation
 mechanism constitutes a significant part of the overall bankruptcy
 frequency, suggesting that it has measurable implications for the
 aggregate level.

Title: Dynamic Marriage Matching: An Empirical Framework 
Author-Name: Eugene Choo  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a new model for empirically analyzing dynamic
 matching in the marriage market and then applies that model to recent
 changes in the U.S. marriage distribution. Its primary objective is to
 estimate gains by age from being married today (till death of at least one
 spouse) relative to remaining single for that same time period. An
 empirical methodology that relies on the model's equilibrium outcomes
 identifies the marriage gains using a single cross‐section of observed
 aggregate matches. This behavioral dynamic model rationalizes a new
 marriage matching function. The model also solves the inverse problem of
 computing the vector of aggregate marriages, given a new distribution of
 available single individuals and estimated preferences. Finally, this
 paper develops a simple test of the model's empirical validity. Using
 aggregate data of new marriages and available single men and women in the
 United States over two decades from 1970 to 1990, I investigate the
 changes in marriage gains over this period.

Title: Commitment, Flexibility, and Optimal Screening of Time Inconsistency 
Author-Name: Simone Galperti  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a theory of optimal provision of commitment devices
 to people who value both commitment and flexibility and whose preferences
 differ in the degree of time inconsistency. If time inconsistency is
 observable, both a planner and a monopolist provide devices that help each
 person commit to the efficient level of flexibility. However, the
 combination of unobservable time inconsistency and preference for
 flexibility causes an adverse‐selection problem. To solve this problem,
 the monopolist and (possibly) the planner curtail flexibility in the
 device for a more inconsistent person at both ends of the efficient choice
 range; moreover, they may have to add unused options to the device for a
 less inconsistent person and also distort his actual choices. This theory
 has normative and positive implications for private and public provision
 of commitment devices.

Title: Savage in the Market 
Author-Name: Federico Echenique  
Author-Name: Kota Saito  
Abstract:
  We develop a behavioral axiomatic characterization of subjective expected
 utility (SEU) under risk aversion. Given is an individual agent's behavior
 in the market: assume a finite collection of asset purchases with
 corresponding prices. We show that such behavior satisfies a “revealed
 preference axiom” if and only if there exists a SEU model (a subjective
 probability over states and a concave utility function over money) that
 accounts for the given asset purchases.

Title: Power Enhancement in High‐Dimensional Cross‐Sectional Tests 
Author-Name: Jianqing Fan  
Author-Name: Yuan Liao  
Author-Name: Jiawei Yao  
Abstract:
  We propose a novel technique to boost the power of testing a
 high‐dimensional vector H :<b>θ</b>=<b>0</b> against sparse alternatives
 where the null hypothesis is violated by only a few components. Existing
 tests based on quadratic forms such as the Wald statistic often suffer
 from low powers due to the accumulation of errors in estimating
 high‐dimensional parameters. More powerful tests for sparse alternatives
 such as thresholding and extreme value tests, on the other hand, require
 either stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the null distribution
 and often suffer from size distortions due to the slow convergence. Based
 on a screening technique, we introduce a “power enhancement component,”
 which is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but
 diverges quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic
 combines the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal
 statistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. The null
 distribution does not require stringent regularity conditions, and is
 completely determined by that of the pivotal statistic. The proposed
 methods are then applied to testing the factor pricing models and
 validating the cross‐sectional independence in panel data models.

Title: Linear Regression for Panel With Unknown Number of Factors as Interactive Fixed Effects 
Author-Name: Hyungsik Roger Moon  
Author-Name: Martin Weidner  
Abstract:
  In this paper, we study the least squares (LS) estimator in a linear
 panel regression model with unknown number of factors appearing as
 interactive fixed effects. Assuming that the number of factors used in
 estimation is larger than the true number of factors in the data, we
 establish the limiting distribution of the LS estimator for the regression
 coefficients as the number of time periods and the number of
 cross‐sectional units jointly go to infinity. The main result of the paper
 is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of the LS
 estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation
 as long as this number is not underestimated. The important practical
 implication of this result is that for inference on the regression
 coefficients, one does not necessarily need to estimate the number of
 interactive fixed effects consistently.

Title: A Test of Exogeneity Without Instrumental Variables in Models With Bunching 
Author-Name: Carolina Caetano  
Abstract:
  This paper presents a test of the exogeneity of a single explanatory
 variable in a multivariate model. It does not require the exogeneity of
 the other regressors or the existence of instrumental variables. The
 fundamental maintained assumption is that the model must be continuous in
 the explanatory variable of interest. This test has power when
 unobservable confounders are discontinuous with respect to the explanatory
 variable of interest, and it is particularly suitable for applications in
 which that variable has bunching points. An application of the test to the
 problem of estimating the effects of maternal smoking in birth weight
 shows evidence of remaining endogeneity, even after controlling for the
 most complete covariate specification in the literature.

Author-Name: John Y. Zhu  
Abstract:
  This paper studies the dynamics of long‐term contracts in repeated
 principal–agent relationships with an impatient agent. Despite the absence
 of exogenous uncertainty, Pareto‐optimal dynamic contracts generically
 oscillate between favoring the principal and favoring the agent.

Title: Tight Revenue Bounds With Possibilistic Beliefs and Level‐k Rationality 
Author-Name: Jing Chen  
Author-Name: Silvio Micali  
Author-Name: Rafael Pass  
Abstract:
  Mechanism design enables a social planner to obtain a desired outcome by
 leveraging the players' rationality and their beliefs. It is thus a
 fundamental, but yet unproven, intuition that the higher the level of
 rationality of the players, the better the set of obtainable outcomes. In
 this paper, we prove this fundamental intuition for players with
 possibilistic beliefs, a model long considered in epistemic game theory.
 Specifically, • We define a sequence of monotonically increasing revenue
 benchmarks for single‐good auctions, G-super-0≤G-super-1≤G-super-2≤⋯,
 where each G-super-i is defined over the players' beliefs and G-super-0 is
 the second‐highest valuation (i.e., the revenue benchmark achieved by the
 second‐price mechanism). • We (1) construct a single, interim individually
 rational, auction mechanism that, without any clue about the rationality
 level of the players, guarantees revenue G-super-k if all players have
 rationality levels ≥k+1, and (2) prove that no such mechanism can
 guarantee revenue even close to G-super-k when at least two players are at
 most level‐k rational.

Title: A Dynamic Reinterpretation of Nash Bargaining With Endogenous Threats 
Author-Name: Dilip Abreu  
Author-Name: David Pearce  
Abstract:
  This paper concerns the two‐stage game introduced in Nash (1953). It
 formalizes a suggestion made (but not pursued) by Nash regarding
 equilibrium selection in that game, and hence offers an arguably more
 solid foundation for the “Nash bargaining with endogenous threats”
 solution. Analogous reasoning is then applied to an infinite horizon game
 to provide equilibrium selection in two‐person repeated games with
 contracts. In this setting, issues about enforcement of threats are much
 less problematic than in Nash's static setting. The analysis can be
 extended to stochastic games with contracts.
