Title: A Theory of the Stakeholder Corporation 
Author-Name: Michael Magill  
Author-Name: Martine Quinzii  
Author-Name: Jean‐Charles Rochet  
Abstract:
  There is a widely held view within the general public that large
 corporations should act in the interests of a broader group of agents than
 just their shareholders (the stakeholder view). This paper presents a
 framework where this idea can be justified. The point of departure is the
 observation that a large firm typically faces endogenous risks that may
 have a significant impact on the workers it employs and the consumers it
 serves. These risks generate externalities on these stakeholders which are
 not internalized by shareholders. As a result, in the competitive
 equilibrium, there is under‐investment in the prevention of these risks.
 We suggest that this under‐investment problem can be alleviated if firms
 are instructed to maximize the total welfare of their stakeholders rather
 than shareholder value alone (stakeholder equilibrium). The stakeholder
 equilibrium can be implemented by introducing new property rights
 (employee rights and consumer rights) and instructing managers to maximize
 the total value of the firm (the value of these rights plus shareholder
 value). If there is only one firm, the stakeholder equilibrium is Pareto
 optimal. However, this is not true with more than one firm and/or
 heterogeneous agents, which illustrates some of the limits of the
 stakeholder model.

Title: Knightian Analysis of the Vickrey Mechanism 
Author-Name: Alessandro Chiesa  
Author-Name: Silvio Micali  
Author-Name: Zeyuan Allen Zhu  
Abstract:
  We analyze the Vickrey mechanism for auctions of multiple identical goods
 when the players have both Knightian uncertainty over their own valuations
 and incomplete preferences. In this model, the Vickrey mechanism is no
 longer dominant‐strategy, and we prove that all dominant‐strategy
 mechanisms are inadequate. However, we also prove that, in undominated
 strategies, the social welfare produced by the Vickrey mechanism in the
 worst case is not only very good, but also essentially optimal.

Title: Strategic Learning and the Topology of Social Networks 
Author-Name: Elchanan Mossel  
Author-Name: Allan Sly  
Author-Name: Omer Tamuz  
Abstract:
  We consider a group of strategic agents who must each repeatedly take one
 of two possible actions. They learn which of the two actions is preferable
 from initial private signals and by observing the actions of their
 neighbors in a social network. We show that the question of whether or not
 the agents learn efficiently depends on the topology of the social
 network. In particular, we identify a geometric “egalitarianism” condition
 on the social network that guarantees learning in infinite networks, or
 learning with high probability in large finite networks, in any
 equilibrium. We also give examples of nonegalitarian networks with
 equilibria in which learning fails.

Title: Truthful Equilibria in Dynamic Bayesian Games 
Author-Name: Johannes Hörner  
Author-Name: Satoru Takahashi  
Author-Name: Nicolas Vieille  
Abstract:
  This paper characterizes an equilibrium payoff subset for dynamic
 Bayesian games as discounting vanishes. Monitoring is imperfect,
 transitions may depend on actions, types may be correlated, and values may
 be interdependent. The focus is on equilibria in which players report
 truthfully. The characterization generalizes that for repeated games,
 reducing the analysis to static Bayesian games with transfers. With
 independent private values, the restriction to truthful equilibria is
 without loss, except for the punishment level: if players withhold their
 information during punishment‐like phases, a folk theorem obtains.

Title: Efficient Competition Through Cheap Talk: The Case of Competing Auctions 
Author-Name: Kyungmin Kim  
Author-Name: Philipp Kircher  
Abstract:
  We consider a large market where auctioneers with private reservation
 values compete for bidders by announcing cheap‐talk messages. If
 auctioneers run efficient first‐price auctions, then there always exists
 an equilibrium in which each auctioneer truthfully reveals her type. The
 equilibrium is constrained efficient, assigning more bidders to
 auctioneers with larger gains from trade. The choice of the trading
 mechanism is crucial for the result. Most notably, the use of second‐price
 auctions (equivalently, ex post bidding) leads to the nonexistence of any
 informative equilibrium. We examine the robustness of our finding in
 various dimensions, including finite markets and equilibrium selection.

Title: Poverty and Self‐Control 
Author-Name: B. Douglas Bernheim  
Author-Name: Debraj Ray  
Author-Name: Şevin Yeltekin  
Abstract:
  We argue that poverty can perpetuate itself by undermining the capacity
 for self‐control. In line with a distinguished psychological literature,
 we consider modes of self‐control that involve the self‐imposed use of
 contingent punishments and rewards. We study settings in which consumers
 with quasi‐hyperbolic preferences confront an otherwise standard
 intertemporal allocation problem with credit constraints. Our main result
 demonstrates that low initial assets can limit self‐control, trapping
 people in poverty, while individuals with high initial assets can
 accumulate indefinitely. Thus, even temporary policies that initiate
 accumulation among the poor may be effective. We examine implications
 concerning the effect of access to credit on saving, the demand for
 commitment devices, the design of financial accounts to promote
 accumulation, and the variation of the marginal propensity to consume
 across income from different sources. We also explore the nature of
 optimal self‐control, demonstrating that it has a simple and behaviorally
 plausible structure that is immune to self‐renegotiation.

Title: The Value of Free Water: Analyzing South Africa's Free Basic Water Policy 
Author-Name: Andrea Szabó  
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes South Africa's Free Basic Water Policy, under which
 households receive a free water allowance equal to the World Health
 Organization's recommended minimum. I estimate residential water demand,
 evaluate the welfare effects of free water, and provide optimal price
 schedules derived from a social planner's problem. I use a data set of
 monthly metered billing data for 60,000 households for 2002–2009 from a
 particularly disadvantaged suburb of Pretoria, with rich price variation
 across 20 different nonlinear tariff schedules. I find that the free
 allowance acts as a lump‐sum subsidy, without large effects on water
 consumption. However, it is possible to reallocate the current subsidy to
 form an optimal tariff without a free allowance, which would increase
 welfare while leaving the water provider's profit unchanged. This optimal
 tariff would also reduce the number of households consuming low quantities
 of water, a desirable policy goal according to the WHO.

Title: Sign Restrictions, Structural Vector Autoregressions, and Useful Prior Information 
Author-Name: Christiane Baumeister  
Author-Name: James D. Hamilton  
Abstract:
  This paper makes the following original contributions to the literature.
 (i) We develop a simpler analytical characterization and numerical
 algorithm for Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions
 (VARs) that can be used for models that are overidentified,
 just‐identified, or underidentified. (ii) We analyze the asymptotic
 properties of Bayesian inference and show that in the underidentified
 case, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous
 coefficients in an n‐variable VAR is confined to the set of values that
 orthogonalize the population variance–covariance matrix of ordinary least
 squares residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional to the
 height of the prior at any point within that set. For example, in a
 bivariate VAR for supply and demand identified solely by sign
 restrictions, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is
 positive, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any
 inference about the demand elasticity is coming exclusively from the prior
 distribution. (iii) We provide analytical characterizations of the
 informative prior distributions for impulse‐response functions that are
 implicit in the traditional sign‐restriction approach to VARs, and we
 note, as a special case of result (ii), that the influence of these priors
 does not vanish asymptotically. (iv) We illustrate how Bayesian inference
 with informative priors can be both a strict generalization and an
 unambiguous improvement over frequentist inference in just‐identified
 models. (v) We propose that researchers need to explicitly acknowledge and
 defend the role of prior beliefs in influencing structural conclusions and
 we illustrate how this could be done using a simple model of the U.S.
 labor market.

Title: Sharing Rule Identification for General Collective Consumption Models 
Author-Name: Laurens Cherchye  
Author-Name: Bram De Rock  
Author-Name: Arthur Lewbel  
Author-Name: Frederic Vermeulen  
Abstract:
  We propose a method to set identify bounds on the sharing rule for a
 general collective household consumption model. Unlike the effects of
 distribution factors, the level of the sharing rule cannot be uniquely
 identified without strong assumptions on preferences across households.
 Our new results show that, though not point identified without these
 assumptions, strong bounds on the sharing rule can be obtained. We get
 these bounds by applying revealed preference restrictions implied by the
 collective model to the household's continuous aggregate demand functions.
 We obtain informative bounds even if nothing is known about whether each
 good is public, private, or assignable within the household, though having
 such information tightens the bounds. We apply our method to US PSID data,
 obtaining narrow bounds that yield useful conclusions regarding the
 effects of income and wages on intrahousehold resource sharing, and on the
 prevalence of individual (as opposed to household level) poverty.

Title: A Test for Instrument Validity 
Author-Name: Toru Kitagawa  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a specification test for instrument validity in the
 heterogeneous treatment effect model with a binary treatment and a
 discrete instrument. The strongest testable implication for instrument
 validity is given by the condition for nonnegativity of point‐identifiable
 compliers' outcome densities. Our specification test infers this testable
 implication using a variance‐weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistic.
 The test can be applied to both discrete and continuous outcome cases, and
 an extension of the test to settings with conditioning covariates is
 provided.

Title: Identifying Higher‐Order Rationality 
Author-Name: Terri Kneeland  
Abstract:
  Strategic choice data from a carefully chosen set of ring‐network games
 are used to obtain individual‐level estimates of higher‐order rationality.
 The experimental design exploits a natural exclusion restriction that is
 considerably weaker than the assumptions underlying alternative designs in
 the literature. In our data set, 93 percent of subjects are rational, 71
 percent are rational and believe others are rational, 44 percent are
 rational and hold second‐order beliefs that others are rational, and 22
 percent are rational and hold at least third‐order beliefs that others are
 rational.
