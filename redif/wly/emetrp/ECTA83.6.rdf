Title: Moral Hazard in High Office and the Dynamics of Aristocracy 
Author-Name: Roger B. Myerson  
Abstract:
  Both aristocratic privileges and constitutional constraints in
 traditional monarchies can be derived from a ruler's incentive to minimize
 expected costs of moral‐hazard rents for high officials. We consider a
 dynamic moral‐hazard model of governors serving a sovereign prince, who
 must deter them from rebellion and hidden corruption which could cause
 costly crises. To minimize costs, a governor's rewards for good
 performance should be deferred up to the maximal credit that the prince
 can be trusted to pay. In the long run, we find that high officials can
 become an entrenched aristocracy with low turnover and large claims on the
 ruler. Dismissals for bad performance should be randomized to avoid
 inciting rebellions, but the prince can profit from reselling vacant
 offices, and so his decisions to dismiss high officials require
 institutionalized monitoring. A soft budget constraint that forgives
 losses for low‐credit governors can become efficient when costs of
 corruption are low.

Title: The Economics of Density: Evidence From the Berlin Wall 
Author-Name: Gabriel M. Ahlfeldt  
Author-Name: Stephen J. Redding  
Author-Name: Daniel M. Sturm  
Author-Name: Nikolaus Wolf  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a quantitative model of internal city structure that
 features agglomeration and dispersion forces and an arbitrary number of
 heterogeneous city blocks. The model remains tractable and amenable to
 empirical analysis because of stochastic shocks to commuting decisions,
 which yield a gravity equation for commuting flows. To structurally
 estimate agglomeration and dispersion forces, we use data on thousands of
 city blocks in Berlin for 1936, 1986, and 2006 and exogenous variation
 from the city's division and reunification. We estimate substantial and
 highly localized production and residential externalities. We show that
 the model with the estimated agglomeration parameters can account both
 qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city
 structure. We show how our quantitative framework can be used to undertake
 counterfactuals for changes in the organization of economic activity
 within cities in response, for example, to changes in the transport
 network.

Title: Leverage and Default in Binomial Economies: A Complete Characterization 
Author-Name: Ana Fostel  
Author-Name: John Geanakoplos  
Abstract:
  Our paper provides a complete characterization of leverage and default in
 binomial economies with financial assets serving as collateral. Our
 Binomial No‐Default Theorem states that any equilibrium is equivalent (in
 real allocations and prices) to another equilibrium in which there is no
 default. Thus actual default is irrelevant, though the potential for
 default drives the equilibrium and limits borrowing. This result is valid
 with arbitrary preferences and endowments, contingent or noncontingent
 promises, many assets and consumption goods, production, and multiple
 periods. We also show that only no‐default equilibria would be selected if
 there were the slightest cost of using collateral or handling default. Our
 Binomial Leverage Theorem shows that equilibrium Loan to Value (LTV) for
 noncontingent debt contracts is the ratio of the worst‐case return of the
 asset to the riskless gross rate of interest. In binomial economies,
 leverage is determined by down risk and not by volatility.

Title: Entry and Exit in OTC Derivatives Markets 
Author-Name: Andrew G. Atkeson  
Author-Name: Andrea L. Eisfeldt  
Author-Name: Pierre‐Olivier Weill  
Abstract:
  We develop a parsimonious model to study the equilibrium and socially
 optimal decisions of banks to enter, trade in, and possibly exit, an OTC
 market. Although we endow all banks with the same trading technology,
 banks' optimal entry and trading decisions endogenously lead to a
 realistic market structure composed of dealers and customers with distinct
 trading patterns. We decompose banks' entry incentives into incentives to
 hedge risk and incentives to make intermediation profits. We show that
 dealer banks enter more than is socially optimal. In the face of large
 negative shocks, they may also exit more than is socially optimal when
 markets are not perfectly resilient.

Title: Promotion, Turnover, and Compensation in the Executive Labor Market 
Author-Name: George‐Levi Gayle  
Author-Name: Limor Golan  
Author-Name: Robert A. Miller  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a generalized Roy model with human capital
 accumulation, moral hazard, and career concerns. We identify and estimate
 the model with a large panel that matches data on publicly listed firms to
 information on their executives. The structural estimates obtained are
 used to decompose the firm‐size pay gap. We find that although total
 compensation and incentive pay increase with firm size,
 certainty‐equivalent pay decreases with firm size. In larger firms, and
 for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality about effort
 results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts for roughly 80
 percent of the firm‐size gap in total compensation. Larger firms are also
 willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract executives. Finally, the
 estimated coefficients on human capital accumulation from formal education
 and experience gained from different firms are individually significant,
 but their collective effect on firm‐size pay differentials nets out.

Title: Stochastic Choice and Revealed Perturbed Utility 
Author-Name: Drew Fudenberg  
Author-Name: Ryota Iijima  
Author-Name: Tomasz Strzalecki  
Abstract:
  Perturbed utility functions—the sum of expected utility and a nonlinear
 perturbation function—provide a simple and tractable way to model various
 sorts of stochastic choice. We provide two easily understood conditions
 each of which characterizes this representation: One condition generalizes
 the acyclicity condition used in revealed preference theory, and the other
 generalizes Luce's IIA condition. We relate the discrimination or
 selectivity of choice rules to properties of their associated
 perturbations, both across different agents and across decision problems.
 We also show that these representations correspond to a form of
 ambiguity‐averse preferences for an agent who is uncertain about her true
 utility.

Title: Identification Properties of Recent Production Function Estimators 
Author-Name: Daniel A. Ackerberg  
Author-Name: Kevin Caves  
Author-Name: Garth Frazer  
Abstract:
  This paper examines some of the recent literature on the estimation of
 production functions. We focus on techniques suggested in two recent
 papers, Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003). While
 there are some solid and intuitive identification ideas in these papers,
 we argue that the techniques can suffer from functional dependence
 problems. We suggest an alternative approach that is based on the ideas in
 these papers, but does not suffer from the functional dependence problems
 and produces consistent estimates under alternative data generating
 processes for which the original procedures do not.

Title: Inference on Causal Effects in a Generalized Regression Kink Design 
Author-Name: David Card  
Author-Name: David S. Lee  
Author-Name: Zhuan Pei  
Author-Name: Andrea Weber  
Abstract:
  We consider nonparametric identification and estimation in a nonseparable
 model where a continuous regressor of interest is a known, deterministic,
 but kinked function of an observed assignment variable. We characterize a
 broad class of models in which a sharp “Regression Kink Design” (RKD or RK
 Design) identifies a readily interpretable treatment‐on‐the‐treated
 parameter (Florens, Heckman, Meghir, and Vytlacil (2008)). We also
 introduce a “fuzzy regression kink design” generalization that allows for
 omitted variables in the assignment rule, noncompliance, and certain types
 of measurement errors in the observed values of the assignment variable
 and the policy variable. Our identifying assumptions give rise to testable
 restrictions on the distributions of the assignment variable and
 predetermined covariates around the kink point, similar to the
 restrictions delivered by Lee (2008) for the regression discontinuity
 design. Using a kink in the unemployment benefit formula, we apply a fuzzy
 RKD to empirically estimate the effect of benefit rates on unemployment
 durations in Austria.

Title: Equivalence Between Out‐of‐Sample Forecast Comparisons and Wald Statistics 
Author-Name: Peter Reinhard Hansen  
Author-Name: Allan Timmermann  
Abstract:
  We demonstrate the asymptotic equivalence between commonly used test
 statistics for out‐of‐sample forecasting performance and conventional Wald
 statistics. This equivalence greatly simplifies the computational burden
 of calculating recursive out‐of‐sample test statistics and their critical
 values. For the case with nested models, we show that the limit
 distribution, which has previously been expressed through stochastic
 integrals, has a simple representation in terms of χ-super-2‐distributed
 random variables and we derive its density. We also generalize the limit
 theory to cover local alternatives and characterize the power properties
 of the test.
