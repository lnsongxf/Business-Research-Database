Title: Money and Credit Redux 
Author-Name: Chao Gu  
Author-Name: Fabrizio Mattesini  
Author-Name: Randall Wright  
Abstract:
  We analyze money and credit as competing payment instruments in
 decentralized exchange. In natural environments, we show the economy does
 not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is tight,
 money is essential, but credit becomes irrelevant. Changes in credit
 conditions are neutral because real balances respond endogenously to keep
 total liquidity constant. This is true for both exogenous and endogenous
 debt limits and policy limits, secured and unsecured lending, and general
 pricing mechanisms. While we show how to overturn some of these results,
 the benchmark model suggests credit might matter less than people think.

Title: Asset Markets With Heterogeneous Information 
Author-Name: Pablo Kurlat  
Abstract:
  This paper studies competitive equilibria of economies where assets are
 heterogeneous and traders have heterogeneous information about them.
 Markets are defined by a price and a procedure for clearing trades, and
 any asset can, in principle, be traded in any market. Buyers can use their
 information to impose acceptance rules which specify which assets they are
 willing to trade in each market. The set of markets where trade takes
 place is derived endogenously. The model can be applied to find conditions
 under which these economies feature fire sales, contagion, and flights to
 quality.

Title: Information in Tender Offers With a Large Shareholder 
Author-Name: Mehmet Ekmekci  
Author-Name: Nenad Kos  
Abstract:
  We study takeovers of firms whose ownership structure is a mixture of
 minority block‐holders and small shareholders. We show that the
 combination of dispersed private information on the side of small
 shareholders and the presence of a large shareholder can facilitate
 profitable takeovers. Furthermore, our analysis implies that even if some
 model of takeovers predicts a profit for the raider, for example, due to
 private benefits, the profit will be underestimated unless the large
 shareholder and the dispersion of information among the small shareholders
 are modeled.

Title: The Role of Automatic Stabilizers in the U.S. Business Cycle 
Author-Name: Alisdair McKay  
Author-Name: Ricardo Reis  
Abstract:
  Most countries have automatic rules in their tax‐and‐transfer systems
 that are partly intended to stabilize economic fluctuations. This paper
 measures their effect on the dynamics of the business cycle. We put
 forward a model that merges the standard incomplete‐markets model of
 consumption and inequality with the new Keynesian model of nominal
 rigidities and business cycles, and that includes most of the main
 potential stabilizers in the U.S. data and the theoretical channels by
 which they may work. We find that the conventional argument that
 stabilizing disposable income will stabilize aggregate demand plays a
 negligible role in the dynamics of the business cycle, whereas
 tax‐and‐transfer programs that affect inequality and social insurance can
 have a larger effect on aggregate volatility. However, as currently
 designed, the set of stabilizers in place in the United States has had
 little effect on the volatility of aggregate output fluctuations or on
 their welfare costs despite stabilizing aggregate consumption. The
 stabilizers have a more important role when monetary policy is constrained
 by the zero lower bound, and they affect welfare significantly through the
 provision of social insurance.

Title: Financial Health Economics 
Author-Name: Ralph S. J. Koijen  
Author-Name: Tomas J. Philipson  
Author-Name: Harald Uhlig  
Abstract:
  We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of the link between
 financial and real health care markets. This link is important as
 financial returns drive investment in medical research and development
 (R&D), which, in turn, affects real spending growth. We document a
 “medical innovation premium” of 4–6% annually for equity returns of firms
 in the health care sector. We interpret this premium as compensating
 investors for government‐induced profit risk, and we provide supportive
 evidence for this hypothesis through company filings and abnormal return
 patterns surrounding threats of government intervention. We quantify the
 implications of the premium for the growth in real health care spending by
 calibrating our model to match historical trends, predicting the share of
 gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to health care to be 32% in the long
 run. Policies that had removed government risk would have led to more than
 a doubling of medical R&D and would have increased the current share of
 health care spending by more than 3% of GDP.

Title: Search With Adverse Selection 
Author-Name: Stephan Lauermann  
Author-Name: Asher Wolinsky  
Abstract:
  This paper analyzes a sequential search model with adverse selection. We
 study information aggregation by the price—how close the equilibrium
 prices are to the full‐information prices—when search frictions are small.
 We identify circumstances under which prices fail to aggregate information
 well even when search frictions are small. We trace this to a strong form
 of the winner's curse that is present in the sequential search model. The
 failure of information aggregation may result in inefficient allocations.

Title: Relational Incentive Contracts With Persistent Private Information 
Author-Name: James M. Malcomson  
Abstract:
  This paper investigates relational incentive contracts with continuous,
 privately observed agent types that are persistent over time. With fixed
 agent types, full separation is not possible when continuation equilibrium
 payoffs following revelation are on the Pareto frontier of attainable
 payoffs. This result is related to the ratchet effect in that: (1) a type
 imitating a less productive type receives an information rent, and (2)
 with full separation, one imitating a more productive type receives the
 same future payoff as that more productive type. However, the reason for
 (2) is fundamentally different than with the ratchet effect. It arises
 from the dynamic enforcement requirement in relational contracts, not from
 the principal having all the bargaining power, and applies whatever the
 distribution between principal and agent of the future gains from the
 relationship (i.e., whatever the point on the Pareto frontier). This
 result extends to sufficiently persistent types under certain conditions.

Title: Equilibrium Labor Turnover, Firm Growth, and Unemployment 
Author-Name: Melvyn G. Coles  
Author-Name: Dale T. Mortensen  
Abstract:
  This paper considers equilibrium quit turnover in a frictional labor
 market with costly hiring by firms, where large firms employ many workers
 and face both aggregate and firm specific productivity shocks. There is
 exogenous firm turnover as new (small) startups enter the market over
 time, while some existing firms fail and exit. Individual firm growth
 rates are disperse and evolve stochastically. The paper highlights how
 dynamic monopsony, where firms trade off lower wages against higher
 (endogenous) employee quit rates, yields excessive job‐to‐job quits. Such
 quits directly crowd out the reemployment prospects of the unemployed.
 With finite firm productivity states, stochastic equilibrium is fully
 tractable and can be computed using standard numerical techniques.

Title: Comment on “Constrained Optimization Approaches to Estimation of Structural Models” 
Author-Name: Fedor Iskhakov  
Author-Name: Jinhyuk Lee  
Author-Name: John Rust  
Author-Name: Bertel Schjerning  
Author-Name: Kyoungwon Seo  
Abstract:
  We revisit the comparison of mathematical programming with equilibrium
 constraints (MPEC) and nested fixed point (NFXP) algorithms for estimating
 structural dynamic models by Su and Judd (2012). Their implementation of
 the nested fixed point algorithm used successive approximations to solve
 the inner fixed point problem (NFXP‐SA). We redo their comparison using
 the more efficient version of NFXP proposed by Rust (1987), which combines
 successive approximations and Newton–Kantorovich iterations to solve the
 fixed point problem (NFXP‐NK). We show that MPEC and NFXP are similar in
 speed and numerical performance when the more efficient NFXP‐NK variant is
 used.
