Title: Usage‐Based Pricing and Demand for Residential Broadband 
Author-Name: Aviv Nevo  
Author-Name: John L. Turner  
Author-Name: Jonathan W. Williams  
Abstract:
  We estimate demand for residential broadband using high‐frequency data
 from subscribers facing a three‐part tariff. The three‐part tariff makes
 data usage during the billing cycle a dynamic problem, thus generating
 variation in the (shadow) price of usage. We provide evidence that
 subscribers respond to this variation, and we use their dynamic decisions
 to estimate a flexible distribution of willingness to pay for different
 plan characteristics. Using the estimates, we simulate demand under
 alternative pricing and find that usage‐based pricing eliminates low‐value
 traffic. Furthermore, we show that the costs associated with investment in
 fiber‐optic networks are likely recoverable in some markets, but that
 there is a large gap between social and private incentives to invest.

Title: Prices, Markups, and Trade Reform 
Author-Name: Jan De Loecker

Abstract:
  This paper examines how prices, markups, and marginal costs respond to
 trade liberalization. We develop a framework to estimate markups from
 production data with multi‐product firms. This approach does not require
 assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor
 assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We exploit
 quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity‐based
 productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices
 by the estimated markups. We use India's trade liberalization episode to
 examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we
 find that trade liberalization lowers factory‐gate prices and that output
 tariff declines have the expected pro‐competitive effects. However, the
 price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which
 fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason
 for this incomplete cost pass‐through to prices is that firms offset their
 reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate
 substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time
 and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least
 immediately after the reforms.

Title: The Political Economy of Moral Conflict: An Empirical Study of Learning and Law Enforcement Under Prohibition 
Author-Name: Camilo García‐Jimeno  
Abstract:
  The U.S. Prohibition experience shows a remarkable policy reversal. In
 only 14 years, a drastic shift in public opinion required two
 constitutional amendments. I develop and estimate a model of endogenous
 law enforcement, determined by beliefs about the Prohibition‐crime nexus
 and alcohol‐related moral views. In turn, the policy outcomes shape
 subsequent learning about Prohibition enforcement costs. I estimate the
 model through maximum likelihood on Prohibition Era city‐level data on
 police enforcement, crime, and alcohol‐related legislation. The model can
 account for the variation in public opinion changes, and the heterogeneous
 responses of law enforcement and violence across cities. Results show that
 a 15% increase in the homicide rate can be attributed to Prohibition
 enforcement. The subsequent learning‐driven adjustment of local law
 enforcement allowed for the alcohol market to rebound to 60% of its
 pre‐Prohibition size. I conclude with counterfactual exercises exploring
 the welfare implications of policy learning, prior beliefs, preference
 polarization, and alternative political environments. Results illustrate
 the importance of incorporating the endogenous nature of law enforcement
 into our understanding of policy failure and policy success.

Title: A Rational Theory of Mutual Funds' Attention Allocation 
Author-Name: Marcin Kacperczyk  
Author-Name: Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh  
Author-Name: Laura Veldkamp  
Abstract:
  The question of whether and how mutual fund managers provide valuable
 services for their clients motivates one of the largest literatures in
 finance. One candidate explanation is that funds process information about
 future asset values and use that information to invest in high‐valued
 assets. But formal theories are scarce because information choice models
 with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This
 paper tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model
 that uses the state of the business cycle to predict information choices,
 which in turn, predict observable patterns of portfolio investments and
 returns. The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff
 shocks, cross‐fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess
 returns are all supported by the data. These findings offer new evidence
 that some investment managers have skill and that attention is allocated
 rationally.

Title: Stochastic Learning Dynamics and Speed of Convergence in Population Games 
Author-Name: Itai Arieli  
Author-Name: H. Peyton Young  
Abstract:
  We study how long it takes for large populations of interacting agents to
 come close to Nash equilibrium when they adapt their behavior using a
 stochastic better reply dynamic. Prior work considers this question mainly
 for 2 × 2 games and potential games; here we characterize convergence
 times for general weakly acyclic games, including coordination games,
 dominance solvable games, games with strategic complementarities,
 potential games, and many others with applications in economics, biology,
 and distributed control. If players' better replies are governed by
 idiosyncratic shocks, the convergence time can grow exponentially in the
 population size; moreover, this is true even in games with very simple
 payoff structures. However, if their responses are sufficiently correlated
 due to aggregate shocks, the convergence time is greatly accelerated; in
 fact, it is bounded for all sufficiently large populations. We provide
 explicit bounds on the speed of convergence as a function of key
 structural parameters including the number of strategies, the length of
 the better reply paths, the extent to which players can influence the
 payoffs of others, and the desired degree of approximation to Nash
 equilibrium.

Title: Elite Recruitment and Political Stability: The Impact of the Abolition of China's Civil Service Exam 
Author-Name: Ying Bai  
Author-Name: Ruixue Jia  
Abstract:
  This paper studies how the abolition of an elite recruitment
 system—China's civil exam system that lasted over 1,300 years—affects
 political stability. Employing a panel data set across 262 prefectures and
 exploring the variations in the quotas on the entry‐level exam candidates,
 we find that higher quotas per capita were associated with a higher
 probability of revolution participation after the abolition and a higher
 incidence of uprisings in 1911 that marked the end of the 2,000 years of
 imperial rule. This finding is robust to various checks including using
 the number of small rivers and short‐run exam performance before the quota
 system as instruments. The patterns in the data appear most consistent
 with the interpretation that in regions with higher quotas per capita
 under the exam system, more would‐be elites were negatively affected by
 the abolition. In addition, we document that modern human capital in the
 form of those studying in Japan also contributed to the revolution and
 that social capital strengthened the effect of quotas on revolution
 participation.

Title: Inefficient Investment Waves 
Author-Name: Zhiguo He  
Author-Name: Péter Kondor  
Abstract:
  We show that firms' individually optimal liquidity management results in
 socially inefficient boom‐and‐bust patterns. Financially constrained firms
 decide on the level of their liquid resources facing cash‐flow shocks and
 time‐varying investment opportunities. Firms' liquidity management
 decisions generate simultaneous waves in aggregate cash holdings and
 investment, even if technology remains constant. These investment waves
 are not constrained efficient in general, because the social and private
 value of liquidity differs. The resulting pecuniary externality affects
 incentives differentially depending on the state of the economy, and often
 overinvestment occurs during booms and underinvestment occurs during
 recessions. In general, policies intended to mitigate underinvestment
 raise prices during recessions, making overinvestment during booms worse.
 However, a well‐designed price‐support policy will increase welfare in
 both booms and recessions.

Title: Matching on the Estimated Propensity Score 
Author-Name: Alberto Abadie  
Author-Name: Guido W. Imbens  
Abstract:
  Propensity score matching estimators (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) are
 widely used in evaluation research to estimate average treatment effects.
 In this article, we derive the large sample distribution of propensity
 score matching estimators. Our derivations take into account that the
 propensity score is itself estimated in a first step, prior to matching.
 We prove that first step estimation of the propensity score affects the
 large sample distribution of propensity score matching estimators, and
 derive adjustments to the large sample variances of propensity score
 matching estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average
 treatment effect on the treated (ATET). The adjustment for the ATE
 estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that
 matching on the estimated propensity score is more efficient than matching
 on the true propensity score in large samples. However, for the ATET
 estimator, the sign of the adjustment term depends on the data generating
 process, and ignoring the estimation error in the propensity score may
 lead to confidence intervals that are either too large or too small.

Title: IV Quantile Regression for Group‐Level Treatments, With an Application to the Distributional Effects of Trade 
Author-Name: Denis Chetverikov  
Author-Name: Bradley Larsen  
Author-Name: Christopher Palmer  
Abstract:
  We present a methodology for estimating the distributional effects of an
 endogenous treatment that varies at the group level when there are
 group‐level unobservables, a quantile extension of Hausman and Taylor,
 1981. Because of the presence of group‐level unobservables, standard
 quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if the
 treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our estimation
 technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, consisting of
 group‐by‐group quantile regression followed by two‐stage least squares.
 Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak
 conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are
 sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero‐mean normality of our
 estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor, 1981, micro‐level covariates can be
 used as internal instruments for the endogenous group‐level treatment if
 they satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions. Our approach applies to
 a broad range of settings including labor, public finance, industrial
 organization, urban economics, and development; we illustrate its
 usefulness with several such examples. Finally, an empirical application
 of our estimator finds that low‐wage earners in the United States from
 1990 to 2007 were significantly more affected by increased Chinese import
 competition than high‐wage earners.

Title: Large Contests 
Author-Name: Wojciech Olszewski  
Author-Name: Ron Siegel  
Abstract:
  We consider contests with many, possibly heterogeneous, players and
 prizes, and show that the equilibrium outcomes of such contests are
 approximated by the outcomes of mechanisms that implement the assortative
 allocation in an environment with a single agent that has a continuum of
 possible types. This makes it possible to easily approximate the
 equilibria of contests whose exact equilibrium characterization is
 complicated, as well as the equilibria of contests for which there is no
 existing equilibrium characterization.

Title: Consumption Commitments and Habit Formation 
Author-Name: Raj Chetty  
Author-Name: Adam Szeidl  
Abstract:
  We analyze the implications of household‐level adjustment costs for the
 dynamics of aggregate consumption. We show that an economy in which agents
 have “consumption commitments” is approximately equivalent to a habit
 formation model in which the habit stock is a weighted average of past
 consumption if idiosyncratic risk is large relative to aggregate risk.
 Consumption commitments can thus explain the empirical regularity that
 consumption is excessively sensitive and excessively smooth, findings that
 are typically attributed to habit formation. Unlike habit formation and
 other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence, the consumption
 commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity and smoothness
 vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that behavior previously
 attributed to habit formation may be better explained by adjustment costs.
 We develop additional testable predictions to further distinguish the
 commitment and habit models and show that the two models have different
 welfare implications.
