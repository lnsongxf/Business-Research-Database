Title: A Dynamic Model of Demand for Houses and Neighborhoods 
Author-Name: Patrick Bayer  
Author-Name: Robert McMillan

Author-Name: Christopher Timmins  
Abstract:
  This paper develops a dynamic model of neighborhood choice along with a
 computationally light multi‐step estimator. The proposed empirical
 framework captures observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity across
 households and locations in a flexible way. We estimate the model using a
 newly assembled data set that matches demographic information from
 mortgage applications to the universe of housing transactions in the San
 Francisco Bay Area from 1994 to 2004. The results provide the first
 estimates of the marginal willingness to pay for several non‐marketed
 amenities—neighborhood air pollution, violent crime, and racial
 composition—in a dynamic framework. Comparing these estimates with those
 from a static version of the model highlights several important biases
 that arise when dynamic considerations are ignored.

Title: Buy, Keep, or Sell: Economic Growth and the Market for Ideas 
Author-Name: Ufuk Akcigit  
Author-Name: Murat Alp Celik  
Author-Name: Jeremy Greenwood  
Abstract:
  An endogenous growth model is developed where each period firms invest in
 researching and developing new ideas. An idea increases a firm's
 productivity. By how much depends on the technological propinquity between
 an idea and the firm's line of business. Ideas can be bought and sold on a
 market for patents. A firm can sell an idea that is not relevant to its
 business or buy one if it fails to innovate. The developed model is
 matched up with stylized facts about the market for patents in the United
 States. The analysis gauges how efficiency in the patent market affects
 growth.

Title: Time‐Varying Risk Premium in Large Cross‐Sectional Equity Data Sets 
Author-Name: Patrick Gagliardini  
Author-Name: Elisa Ossola  
Author-Name: Olivier Scaillet  
Abstract:
  We develop an econometric methodology to infer the path of risk premia
 from a large unbalanced panel of individual stock returns. We estimate the
 time‐varying risk premia implied by conditional linear asset pricing
 models where the conditioning includes both instruments common to all
 assets and asset‐specific instruments. The estimator uses simple weighted
 two‐pass cross‐sectional regressions, and we show its consistency and
 asymptotic normality under increasing cross‐sectional and time series
 dimensions. We address consistent estimation of the asymptotic variance by
 hard thresholding, and testing for asset pricing restrictions induced by
 the no‐arbitrage assumption. We derive the restrictions given by a
 continuum of assets in a multi‐period economy under an approximate factor
 structure robust to asset repackaging. The empirical analysis on returns
 for about ten thousand U.S. stocks from July 1964 to December 2009 shows
 that risk premia are large and volatile in crisis periods. They exhibit
 large positive and negative strays from time‐invariant estimates, follow
 the macroeconomic cycles, and do not match risk premia estimates on
 standard sets of portfolios. The asset pricing restrictions are rejected
 for a conditional four‐factor model capturing market, size, value, and
 momentum effects.

Title: No‐Bubble Condition: Model‐Free Tests in Housing Markets 
Author-Name: Stefano Giglio  
Author-Name: Matteo Maggiori  
Author-Name: Johannes Stroebel  
Abstract:
  We test for the existence of housing bubbles associated with a failure of
 the transversality condition that requires the present value of payments
 occurring infinitely far in the future to be zero. The most prominent such
 bubble is the classic rational bubble. We study housing markets in the
 United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes
 the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are
 finite‐maturity, pre‐paid, and tradeable ownership contracts with
 maturities often exceeding 700 years. Freeholds are infinite‐maturity
 ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds with
 extremely‐long maturities and freeholds reflects the present value of a
 claim to the freehold after leasehold expiry, and is thus a direct
 empirical measure of the transversality condition. We estimate this price
 difference, and find no evidence of failures of the transversality
 condition in housing markets in the U.K. and Singapore, even during
 periods when a sizable bubble was regularly thought to be present.

Title: Berk–Nash Equilibrium: A Framework for Modeling Agents With Misspecified Models 
Author-Name: Ignacio Esponda  
Author-Name: Demian Pouzo  
Abstract:
  We develop an equilibrium framework that relaxes the standard assumption
 that people have a correctly specified view of their environment. Each
 player is characterized by a (possibly misspecified) subjective model,
 which describes the set of feasible beliefs over payoff‐relevant
 consequences as a function of actions. We introduce the notion of a
 Berk–Nash equilibrium: Each player follows a strategy that is optimal
 given her belief, and her belief is restricted to be the best fit among
 the set of beliefs she considers possible. The notion of best fit is
 formalized in terms of minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence, which
 is endogenous and depends on the equilibrium strategy profile. Standard
 solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and self‐confirming equilibrium
 constitute special cases where players have correctly specified models. We
 provide a learning foundation for Berk–Nash equilibrium by extending and
 combining results from the statistics literature on misspecified learning
 and the economics literature on learning in games.

Title: Reputational Bargaining and Deadlines 
Author-Name: Jack Fanning  
Abstract:
  I highlight how reputational concerns provide a natural explanation for
 “deadline effects,” the high frequency of deals prior to a deadline in
 bargaining. Rational agents imitate the demands of obstinate behavioral
 types and engage in brinkmanship in the face of uncertainty about the
 deadline's arrival. I also identify how surplus is divided when the prior
 probability of behavioral types is vanishingly small. If behavioral types
 are committed to fixed demands, outcomes converge to the Nash bargaining
 solution regardless of agents' respective impatience. If behavioral types
 can adopt more complex demand strategies, outcomes converge to the
 solution of an alternating offers game without behavioral types for the
 deadline environment.

Title: Utilitarian Preferences With Multiple Priors 
Author-Name: Shiri Alon  
Author-Name: Gabi Gayer  
Abstract:
  This paper proposes a method for aggregating individual preferences in
 the context of uncertainty. Individuals are assumed to abide by Savage's
 model of Subjective Expected Utility, in which everyone has his/her own
 utility and subjective probability. Disagreement on probabilities among
 individuals gives rise to uncertainty at the societal level, and thus
 society may entertain a set of probabilities rather than only one. We
 assume that social preference admits a Maxmin Expected Utility
 representation. In this context, two Pareto‐type conditions are shown to
 be equivalent to social utility being a weighted average of individual
 utilities and the social set of priors containing only weighted averages
 of individual priors. Thus, society respects consensus among individuals'
 beliefs and does not add ambiguity beyond disagreement on beliefs. We also
 deal with the case in which society does not rule out any individual
 belief.

Title: Menu‐Dependent Stochastic Feasibility 
Author-Name: Richard L. Brady  
Author-Name: John Rehbeck  
Abstract:
  We examine the role of stochastic feasibility in consumer choice using a
 random conditional choice set rule (RCCSR) and uniquely characterize the
 model from conditions on stochastic choice data. Feasibility is modeled to
 permit correlation in availability of alternatives. This provides a
 natural way to examine substitutability/complementarity. We show that an
 RCCSR generalizes the random consideration set rule of [Manzini and
 Mariotti, 2014]. We then relate this model to existing literature. In
 particular, an RCCSR is not a random utility model.

Title: Individual Heterogeneity and Average Welfare 
Author-Name: Jerry A. Hausman  
Author-Name: Whitney K. Newey  
Abstract:
  Individual heterogeneity is an important source of variation in demand.
 Allowing for general heterogeneity is needed for correct welfare
 comparisons. We consider general heterogeneous demand where preferences
 and linear budget sets are statistically independent. Only the marginal
 distribution of demand for each price and income is identified from
 cross‐section data where only one price and income is observed for each
 individual. Thus, objects that depend on varying price and/or income for
 an individual are not generally identified, including average exact
 consumer surplus. We use bounds on income effects to derive relatively
 simple bounds on the average surplus, including for discrete/continuous
 choice. We also sketch an approach to bounding surplus that does not use
 income effect bounds. We apply the results to gasoline demand. We find
 tight bounds for average surplus in this application, but wider bounds for
 average deadweight loss.

Title: A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Econometric Models 
Author-Name: Isaiah Andrews  
Author-Name: Anna Mikusheva  
Abstract:
  Conventional tests for composite hypotheses in minimum distance models
 can be unreliable when the relationship between the structural and
 reduced‐form parameters is highly nonlinear. Such nonlinearity may arise
 for a variety of reasons, including weak identification. In this note, we
 begin by studying the problem of testing a “curved null” in a
 finite‐sample Gaussian model. Using the curvature of the model, we develop
 new finite‐sample bounds on the distribution of minimum‐distance
 statistics. These bounds allow us to construct tests for composite
 hypotheses which are uniformly asymptotically valid over a large class of
 data generating processes and structural models.

Title: Shadow Insurance 
Author-Name: Ralph S. J. Koijen  
Author-Name: Motohiro Yogo  
Abstract:
  Life insurers use reinsurance to move liabilities from regulated and
 rated companies that sell policies to shadow reinsurers, which are less
 regulated and unrated off‐balance‐sheet entities within the same insurance
 group. U.S. life insurance and annuity liabilities ceded to shadow
 reinsurers grew from $11 billion in 2002 to $364 billion in 2012. Life
 insurers using shadow insurance, which capture half of the market share,
 ceded 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in 2012, up
 from 2 cents in 2002. By relaxing capital requirements, shadow insurance
 could reduce the marginal cost of issuing policies and thereby improve
 retail market efficiency. However, shadow insurance could also reduce
 risk‐based capital and increase expected loss for the industry. We model
 and quantify these effects based on publicly available data and plausible
 assumptions.
