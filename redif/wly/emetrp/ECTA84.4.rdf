Title: From Bottom of the Barrel to Cream of the Crop: Sequential Screening With Positive Selection 
Author-Name: Jean Tirole  
Abstract:
  In a number of interesting environments, dynamic screening involves
 positive selection: in contrast with Coasian dynamics, only the most
 motivated remain over time. The paper provides conditions under which the
 principal's commitment optimum is time consistent and uses this result to
 derive testable predictions under permanent or transient shocks. It also
 identifies environments in which time consistency does not hold despite
 positive selection, and yet simple equilibrium characterizations can be
 obtained.

Title: Market Microstructure Invariance: Empirical Hypotheses 
Author-Name: Albert S. Kyle  
Author-Name: Anna A. Obizhaeva  
Abstract:
  Using the intuition that financial markets transfer risks in business
 time, “market microstructure invariance” is defined as the hypotheses that
 the distributions of risk transfers (“bets”) and transaction costs are
 constant across assets when measured per unit of business time. The
 invariance hypotheses imply that bet size and transaction costs have
 specific, empirically testable relationships to observable dollar volume
 and volatility. Portfolio transitions can be viewed as natural experiments
 for measuring transaction costs, and individual orders can be treated as
 proxies for bets. Empirical tests based on a data set of 400,000+
 portfolio transition orders support the invariance hypotheses. The
 constants calibrated from structural estimation imply specific predictions
 for the arrival rate of bets (“market velocity”), the distribution of bet
 sizes, and transaction costs.

Title: Robust Contracts in Continuous Time 
Author-Name: Jianjun Miao  
Author-Name: Alejandro Rivera  
Abstract:
  We study a continuous‐time contracting problem under hidden action, where
 the principal has ambiguous beliefs about the project cash flows. The
 principal designs a robust contract that maximizes his utility under the
 worst‐case scenario subject to the agent's incentive and participation
 constraints. Robustness generates endogenous belief heterogeneity and
 induces a tradeoff between incentives and ambiguity sharing so that the
 incentive constraint does not always bind. We implement the optimal
 contract by cash reserves, debt, and equity. In addition to receiving
 ordinary dividends when cash reserves reach a threshold, outside equity
 holders also receive special dividends or inject cash in the cash reserves
 to hedge against model uncertainty and smooth dividends. The equity
 premium and the credit yield spread generated by ambiguity aversion are
 state dependent and high for distressed firms with low cash reserves.

Title: Insider Trading, Stochastic Liquidity, and Equilibrium Prices 
Author-Name: Pierre Collin‐Dufresne  
Author-Name: Vyacheslav Fos  
Abstract:
  We extend Kyle's (1985) model of insider trading to the case where noise
 trading volatility follows a general stochastic process. We determine
 conditions under which, in equilibrium, price impact and price volatility
 are both stochastic, driven by shocks to uninformed volume even though the
 fundamental value is constant. The volatility of price volatility appears
 ‘excessive’ because insiders choose to trade more aggressively (and thus
 more information is revealed) when uninformed volume is higher and price
 impact is lower. This generates a positive relation between price
 volatility and trading volume, giving rise to an endogenous subordinate
 stochastic process for prices.

Title: Why Doesn't Technology Flow From Rich to Poor Countries? 
Author-Name: Harold L. Cole  
Author-Name: Jeremy Greenwood  
Author-Name: Juan M. Sanchez  
Abstract:
  What is the role of a country's financial system in determining
 technology adoption? To examine this, a dynamic contract model is embedded
 into a general equilibrium setting with competitive intermediation. The
 terms of finance are dictated by an intermediary's ability to monitor and
 control a firm's cash flow, in conjunction with the structure of the
 technology that the firm adopts. It is not always profitable to finance
 promising technologies. A quantitative illustration is presented where
 financial frictions induce entrepreneurs in India and Mexico to adopt
 less‐promising ventures than in the United States, despite lower input
 prices.

Title: Unemployment and Business Cycles 
Author-Name: Lawrence J. Christiano  
Author-Name: Martin S. Eichenbaum  
Author-Name: Mathias Trabandt  
Abstract:
  We develop and estimate a general equilibrium search and matching model
 that accounts for key business cycle properties of macroeconomic
 aggregates, including labor market variables. In sharp contrast to leading
 New Keynesian models, we do not impose wage inertia. Instead we derive
 wage inertia from our specification of how firms and workers negotiate
 wages. Our model outperforms a variant of the standard New Keynesian Calvo
 sticky wage model. According to our estimated model, there is a critical
 interaction between the degree of price stickiness, monetary policy, and
 the duration of an increase in unemployment benefits.

Title: Conditional Inference With a Functional Nuisance Parameter 
Author-Name: Isaiah Andrews  
Author-Name: Anna Mikusheva  
Abstract:
  This paper shows that the problem of testing hypotheses in moment
 condition models without any assumptions about identification may be
 considered as a problem of testing with an infinite‐dimensional nuisance
 parameter. We introduce a sufficient statistic for this nuisance parameter
 in a Gaussian problem and propose conditional tests. These conditional
 tests have uniformly correct asymptotic size for a large class of models
 and test statistics. We apply our approach to construct tests based on
 quasi‐likelihood ratio statistics, which we show are efficient in strongly
 identified models and perform well relative to existing alternatives in
 two examples.

Title: Generalized Method of Integrated Moments for High‐Frequency Data 
Author-Name: Jia Li  
Author-Name: Dacheng Xiu  
Abstract:
  We propose a semiparametric two‐step inference procedure for a
 finite‐dimensional parameter based on moment conditions constructed from
 high‐frequency data. The population moment conditions take the form of
 temporally integrated functionals of state‐variable processes that include
 the latent stochastic volatility process of an asset. In the first step,
 we nonparametrically recover the volatility path from high‐frequency asset
 returns. The nonparametric volatility estimator is then used to form
 sample moment functions in the second‐step GMM estimation, which requires
 the correction of a high‐order nonlinearity bias from the first step. We
 show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically mixed
 Gaussian and propose a consistent estimator for the conditional asymptotic
 variance. We also construct a Bierens‐type consistent specification test.
 These infill asymptotic results are based on a novel
 empirical‐process‐type theory for general integrated functionals of noisy
 semimartingale processes.
