Title: A Theory of Macroprudential Policies in the Presence of Nominal Rigidities 
Author-Name: Emmanuel Farhi  
Author-Name: Iván Werning  
Abstract:
  We propose a theory of monetary policy and macroprudential interventions
 in financial markets. We focus on economies with nominal rigidities in
 goods and labor markets and subject to constraints on monetary policy,
 such as the zero lower bound or fixed exchange rates. We identify an
 aggregate demand externality that can be corrected by macroprudential
 interventions in financial markets. Ex post, the distribution of wealth
 across agents affects aggregate demand and output. Ex ante, however, these
 effects are not internalized in private financial decisions. We provide a
 simple formula for the required financial interventions that depends on a
 small number of measurable sufficient statistics. We also characterize
 optimal monetary policy. We extend our framework to incorporate pecuniary
 externalities, providing a unified approach to both externalities.
 Finally, we provide a number of applications which illustrate the
 relevance of our theory.

Title: Female Labor Supply, Human Capital, and Welfare Reform 
Author-Name: Richard Blundell  
Author-Name: Monica Costa Dias  
Author-Name: Costas Meghir  
Author-Name: Jonathan Shaw  
Abstract:
  We estimate a dynamic model of employment, human capital
 accumulation—including education, and savings for women in the United
 Kingdom, exploiting tax and benefit reforms, and use it to analyze the
 effects of welfare policy. We find substantial elasticities for labor
 supply and particularly for lone mothers. Returns to experience, which are
 important in determining the longer‐term effects of policy, increase with
 education, but experience mainly accumulates when in full‐time employment.
 Tax credits are welfare improving in the U.K., increase lone‐mother labor
 supply and marginally reduce educational attainment, but the employment
 effects do not extend beyond the period of eligibility. Marginal increases
 in tax credits improve welfare more than equally costly increases in
 income support or tax cuts.

Title: An Empirical Equilibrium Model of a Decentralized Asset Market 
Author-Name: Alessandro Gavazza  
Abstract:
  I estimate a search‐and‐bargaining model of a decentralized market to
 quantify the effects of trading frictions on asset allocations, asset
 prices, and welfare, and to quantify the effects of intermediaries that
 facilitate trade. Using business‐aircraft data, I find that, relative to
 the Walrasian benchmark, 18.3 percent of the assets are misallocated;
 prices are 19.2 percent lower; and the aggregate welfare losses equal 23.9
 percent. Dealers play an important role in reducing trading frictions: In
 a market with no dealers, a larger fraction of assets would be
 misallocated, and prices would be higher. However, dealers reduce
 aggregate welfare because their operations are costly, and they impose a
 negative externality by decreasing the number of agents' direct
 transactions.

Title: Robust Confidence Regions for Incomplete Models 
Author-Name: Larry G. Epstein  
Author-Name: Hiroaki Kaido  
Author-Name: Kyoungwon Seo  
Abstract:
  Call an economic model incomplete if it does not generate a probabilistic
 prediction even given knowledge of all parameter values. We propose a
 method of inference about unknown parameters for such models that is
 robust to heterogeneity and dependence of unknown form. The key is a
 Central Limit Theorem for belief functions; robust confidence regions are
 then constructed in a fashion paralleling the classical approach. Monte
 Carlo simulations support tractability of the method and demonstrate its
 enhanced robustness relative to existing methods.

Title: Consistent Probabilistic Social Choice 
Author-Name: Florian Brandl  
Author-Name: Felix Brandt  
Author-Name: Hans Georg Seedig  
Abstract:
  Two fundamental axioms in social choice theory are consistency with
 respect to a variable electorate and consistency with respect to
 components of similar alternatives. In the context of traditional
 non‐probabilistic social choice, these axioms are incompatible with each
 other. We show that in the context of probabilistic social choice, these
 axioms uniquely characterize a function proposed by Fishburn (1984).
 Fishburn's function returns so‐called maximal lotteries, that is,
 lotteries that correspond to optimal mixed strategies in the symmetric
 zero‐sum game induced by the pairwise majority margins. Maximal lotteries
 are guaranteed to exist due to von Neumann's Minimax Theorem, are almost
 always unique, and can be efficiently computed using linear programming.

Title: The Effect of Changes in Risk Attitude on Strategic Behavior 
Author-Name: Jonathan Weinstein  
Abstract:
  We study families of normal‐form games with fixed preferences over pure
 action profiles but varied preferences over lotteries. That is, we subject
 players' utilities to monotone but nonlinear transformations and examine
 changes in the rationalizable set and set of equilibria. Among our
 results: The rationalizable set always grows under concave transformations
 (risk aversion) and shrinks under convex transformations (risk love). The
 rationalizable set reaches an upper bound under extreme risk aversion, and
 lower bound under risk love, and both of these bounds are characterized by
 elimination processes. For generic two‐player games, under extreme risk
 love or aversion, all Nash equilibria are close to pure and the limiting
 set of equilibria can be described using preferences over pure action
 profiles.

Title: A Note on Comparative Ambiguity Aversion and Justifiability 
Author-Name: P. Battigalli  
Author-Name: S. Cerreia‐Vioglio  
Author-Name: F. Maccheroni  
Author-Name: M. Marinacci  
Abstract:
  We consider a decision maker who ranks actions according to the smooth
 ambiguity criterion of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005). An action
 is justifiable if it is a best reply to some belief over probabilistic
 models. We show that higher ambiguity aversion expands the set of
 justifiable actions. A similar result holds for risk aversion. Our results
 follow from a generalization of the duality lemma of Wald (1949) and
 Pearce (1984).

Title: Farms, Families, and Markets: New Evidence on Completeness of Markets in Agricultural Settings 
Author-Name: Daniel LaFave  
Author-Name: Duncan Thomas  
Abstract:
  The farm household model has played a central role in improving the
 understanding of small‐scale agricultural households and non‐farm
 enterprises. Under the assumptions that all current and future markets
 exist and that farmers treat all prices as given, the model simplifies
 households' simultaneous production and consumption decisions into a
 recursive form in which production can be treated as independent of
 preferences of household members. These assumptions, which are the
 foundation of a large literature in labor and development, have been
 tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin
 (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central
 Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive model:
 demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition of the
 farm household. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The rejection
 cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved heterogeneity that
 is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or farm‐specific shocks
 that affect changes in household composition and farm labor demand. We
 conclude that the recursive form of the farm household model is not
 consistent with the data. Developing empirically tractable models of farm
 households when markets are incomplete remains an important challenge.

Title: Large Market Asymptotics for Differentiated Product Demand Estimators With Economic Models of Supply 
Author-Name: Timothy B. Armstrong  
Abstract:
  IO economists often estimate demand for differentiated products using
 data sets with a small number of large markets. This paper addresses the
 question of consistency and asymptotic distributions of instrumental
 variables estimates as the number of products increases in some commonly
 used models of demand under conditions on economic primitives. I show
 that, in a Bertrand–Nash equilibrium, product characteristics lose their
 identifying power as price instruments in the limit in certain cases,
 leading to inconsistent estimates. The reason is that product
 characteristic instruments achieve identification through correlation with
 markups, and, depending on the model of demand, the supply side can
 constrain markups to converge to a constant quickly relative to sampling
 error. I find that product characteristic instruments can yield consistent
 estimates in many of the cases I consider, but care must be taken in
 modeling demand and choosing instruments. A Monte Carlo study confirms
 that the asymptotic results are relevant in market sizes of practical
 importance.
