To do so, we provide a general framework to model the evolutions of forecasts generated by multiple decision makers who forecast demand for the same product. We also model the evolutions of forecasts when decision makers have asymmetric demand information and refer to it as the <i>Martingale Model of Asymmetric Forecast Evolutions</i>. This model helps us study mechanism design problems in a dynamic environment. In particular, we consider a supplier's (principal's) problem of eliciting credible forecast information from a manufacturer (agent) when both firms obtain asymmetric demand information for the end product over multiple periods. The supplier uses demand information to better plan for a capacity investment decision. When the supplier postpones building capacity and screening the manufacturer's private information, the supplier and the manufacturer can obtain more information and update their forecasts. This delay, however, may increase (respectively, decrease) the degree of information asymmetry between the two firms, resulting in a higher (respectively, lower) cost of screening. The capacity building cost may also increase because of a tighter deadline for building capacity. Considering all such trade-offs, the supplier has to determine (i) when to stop obtaining new demand information and build capacity, (ii) whether to offer a screening contract to credibly elicit private forecast information or to determine the capacity level without information sharing, (iii) how much capacity to build, and (iv) how to design the overall mechanism so that both firms benefit from this mechanism. This paper provides an answer to these questions. In doing so, we develop a new solution approach for a class of dynamic mechanism design problems.

We propose a new approach to deal with this problem. The proposed method clusters data such that the data points within a group are similar in the nonconfidential attribute values, whereas the confidential attribute values within a group are <i>well distributed</i>. To accomplish this, the clustering method, which is based on a minimum spanning tree (MST) technique, uses two risk-utility trade-off measures in the growing and pruning stages of the MST technique, respectively. As part of our approach we also propose a novel cluster-level microperturbation method for masking data that overcomes a common problem of traditional clustering-based methods for data masking, which is their inability to preserve important statistical properties such as the variance of attributes and the covariance across attributes. We show that the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the masked data generated using the microperturbation method are unbiased estimates of the original mean vector and covariance matrix.

If customers who have been in the system for a long time generate interruptions and thus additional work for the investigator, we show that it is asymptotically optimal for the investigator to keep the system occupancy low and prioritize discharging customers.

In particular, the results imply that the exploration--exploitation trade-off introduced by demand censoring is fundamentally different in the continuous and discrete demand cases, and that active exploration plays a much stronger role in the latter case. We further establish that in the discrete demand case, the need for active exploration almost disappears as soon as a lost sales indicator (that records whether demand was censored or not) becomes available, in addition to the censored demand samples.<i>This paper was accepted by G\u00e9rard P.

This setting has previously been considered analytically intractable. By deriving component good prices as exact algebraic functions of the optimal bundle price, I reduce the multiproduct pricing problem to a univariate nonlinear optimization problem in the bundle price. When the two component goods are sufficiently asymmetric in valuations, the optimal solution is partial mixed bundling (one component good is not sold separately), for which I derive exact conditions and optimal prices. An exact analytical solution is also given for mixed bundling of two information goods (component goods with zero marginal costs).

We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice.<i>This paper was accepted by Assaf Zeevi, stochastic models and simulation.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["dynamic programming", "partially and completely observable Markov decision process models", "medical decision making", "liver transplantation", "value of information"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Alleviating the Patient's Price of Privacy Through a Partially Observable Waiting List", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1671", "ex:pages": "1836-1854", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "59", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "burhan@chicagobooth.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Booth School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637", "ex:name": "Burhaneddin Sand\u0131k\u00e7\u0131"}, {"ex:email": "maillart@pitt.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261", "ex:name": "Lisa M.

Previous findings in the literature show that when participants are risk neutral, the ratio of forward sales to spot sales is a function of market concentration alone; also, the lower the concentration, the higher this ratio. These findings hold under the assumption that demand is either deterministic or, if demand is uncertain, all production takes place after uncertainty is fully resolved and production plans can be altered instantaneously and costlessly.

We also find that customers' sensitivity to waiting is heterogeneous and negatively correlated with price sensitivity, which has important implications for pricing in a multiproduct category subject to congestion effects.<i>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["queuing", "service operations", "retail", "choice modeling", "empirical operations management", "operations/marketing interface", "Bayesian estimation", "service quality"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Measuring the Effect of Queues on Customer Purchases", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1120.1686", "ex:pages": "1743-1763", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "59", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2013", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "yl2494@columbia.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Decision, Risk, and Operations Division, Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027", "ex:name": "Yina Lu"}, {"ex:email": "andres.musalem@duke.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708", "ex:name": "Andr\u00e9s Musalem"}, {"ex:email": "molivares@columbia.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Decision, Risk, and Operations Division, Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027; and Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile 8370439", "ex:name": "Marcelo Olivares"}, {"ex:email": "ariel.schilkrut@scopixsolutions.com", "ex:affiliation": "SCOPIX, Burlingame, California 94010", "ex:name": "Ariel Schilkrut"}]}, {"ex:issue": "8", "ex:abstract": "We analyze mixed bundling in two-sided markets where installed base effects are present and find that the pricing structure deviates from traditional bundling as well as the standard two-sided markets literature---we determine prices on both sides fall with bundling.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the strength of preference for such customized distributions and to draw conclusions about the demand for personalized investment products. In two experimental studies, 256 participants could adjust the return distribution of an initially chosen B&H investment by using an interactive software program. Our main finding is that most investors make extensive use of the customization option and many are willing to pay a substantial fee for this additional flexibility. We further find that the willingness to pay for customization is lower if the fee is integrated into the display of the return distribution, making its impact on final returns more obvious.

As a robustness check, we also survey real investors at an investors fair to compare their preferences with those of our main pool of student subjects. We find that the willingness to pay for customization is slightly lower for these real investors and the main effect of fee integration is also less pronounced.

Within economic geography, positive externalities such as increase in demand explain firms' desire to locate close to their rivals whereas negative externalities such as competition explain their desire to avoid them. Within the ecological tradition, density dependence theory explains this relationship in terms of legitimation of an organizational form in a particular market and subsequently increased competition for resources there. Within new institutional theory, the presence of rivals is seen as a signal that a particular market is suitable for entry.

In settings where prices are fixed, we characterize the optimal release time and demonstrate why in some cases it can actually be preferable to delay release when customer error reporting rates increase. The manner in which a firm's optimal release time responds to increases in software functionality critically hinges on whether the added functionality enhances or dilutes user error reporting; in both cases, the effect of added functionality on release timing can go in either direction, depending on both firm and product market characteristics. For example, when processing costs are relatively large compared with goodwill costs, firms with lower process maturity will release earlier when per-module error reporting contributions become diluted and release later when these contributions become enhanced.

The release of functionalities is influenced by reuse, i.e., the effort spent by the development team to write code that can be reused within the same project or in future projects. For example, the development team may choose to spend extra effort to make certain portions of the system reusable because doing so could reduce the effort needed to develop the entire system. However, the additional effort spent on reuse could delay the release of certain critical functionality, making such a strategy suboptimal for the users. Thus, optimal reuse decisions for developers and users could be different.

The volatility spread formula serves as the basis for using the generalized method of moments to estimate investors' risk aversion. We adopt the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model for the physical return process and estimate the model using the S&P 500 daily index returns and then deduce the forward-looking variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the corresponding cumulative return. The forward-looking risk premiums are estimated monthly over the sample period of 2001--2010, and all are found to be positive. Furthermore, two asset pricing tests are conducted.

A social planner can mitigate these effects in two ways: (i) by providing the full reference distribution of outputs instead of an aggregate reference point based on the average output and (ii) by assigning players into uniform rather than diverse reference groups. Social planners may thus need to tailor the reference structure to the predominant mode of social comparison and their objective. A performance-focused social planner may set the reference structure so as to maximize the output of either the top or the bottom player depending on whether she puts greater marginal weight to larger or smaller outputs. When the social planner also cares about utility, she faces a dilemma because performance optimization may not be aligned with utility maximization.

Focusing on problems with a relatively small number of constraints, but with a large number of variables, we develop a hybrid partitioning and enumeration solution scheme by combining the entropic approach with the recently developed improved surrogate constraint (ISC) method to produce the new method we call ISCENT.

A common allocation mechanism is based on a retailer's sales history: a retailer that has ordered larger quantities in the past should get a greater allocation than a retailer that has historically ordered smaller quantities. This mechanism, known as a turn-and-earn allocation rule, is commonly used in many industries such as automobiles, microprocessors, video game consoles, etc. The existing literature has considered the effect of turn-and-earn allocation rules when a manufacturer sells a single product. However, when we consider a product line, it is not clear whether the manufacturer is better off basing its allocation on the sales history of the entire product line or solely on the sales history of the product in short supply. In particular, a shortage of one product can lead retailers and consumers to move toward other products in the line. This, in turn, can have an effect on the manufacturer's optimal allocation mechanism. We examine this issue by developing a model of a supplier selling two substitutable goods through two retailers. Within this setup, we introduce a general turn-and-earn allocation rule that allows the entire sales history to influence allocation levels.

Before investing in capacity, the firm issues the optimal amount of debt, trading off the tax benefit and lower transaction cost of debt financing against the cost of financial distress and the agency cost associated with leverage. We show that in the presence of debt, resource flexibility has benefits in addition to reducing the mismatch between supply and demand. Namely, resource flexibility mitigates the shareholder--debtholder agency conflict as well as the risk of costly default. Most interestingly, we show that resource flexibility mitigates the underinvestment problem because it reduces the probability that a firm will go bankrupt with some of its capacity being fully utilized. When lenders anticipate that a firm will choose a relatively flexible capacity mix, they should provide more favorable credit terms, to which the firm should respond by issuing more debt.

This dilemma motivates us to investigate the value of coordinating decisions on prices and capacity allocation in a stylized setting. We propose two pairs of sequential policies for making static decisions---on pricing and revenue management---that differ in their degree of integration (hierarchical versus coordinated) and their pricing inputs (deterministic versus stochastic). For a large class of stochastic, price-dependent demand models, we prove that these four heuristics admit tractable solutions satisfying intuitive sensitivity properties. We further evaluate numerically the performance of these policies relative to a fully coordinated model, which is generally intractable. We find it interesting that near-optimal performance is usually achieved by a simple hierarchical policy that sets prices first, based on a nonnested stochastic model, and then uses these prices to optimize nested capacity allocation. This tractable policy largely outperforms its counterpart based on a deterministic pricing model. Jointly optimizing price and allocation decisions for the high-end segment improves performance, but the largest revenue benefits stem from adjusting prices to account for demand risk.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["revenue management", "pricing", "coordination", "price-sensitive stochastic demand", "hierarchical policies", "lost sales rate elasticity"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Pricing and Revenue Management: The Value of Coordination", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1782", "ex:pages": "730-752", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "aysekoca@bilkent.edu.tr", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Management, Bilkent University, Bilkent, Ankara 06800, Turkey", "ex:name": "Ay\u015fe Kocab\u0131y\u0131ko\u011flu"}, {"ex:email": "ioana.popescu@insead.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Decision Sciences Area, INSEAD, Singapore 138676", "ex:name": "Ioana Popescu"}, {"ex:email": "catalina.stefanescu-cuntze@esmt.org", "ex:affiliation": "European School of Management and Technology, 10178 Berlin, Germany", "ex:name": "Catalina Stefanescu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "In three experiments we show that the endowment effect---the tendency to demand more money for relinquishing owned goods than one is willing to pay for the same goods---fails to emerge when sellers are not fully depleted of their endowment.

The key idea of the policy is to enhance the certainty equivalent pricing policy with a taboo interval around the average of previously chosen prices. The width of the taboo interval shrinks at an appropriate rate as the amount of data gathered gets large; this guarantees sufficient price dispersion. For a large class of demand models, we show that this procedure is strongly consistent, which means that eventually the value of the optimal price will be learned, and derive upper bounds on the regret, which is the expected amount of money lost due to not using the optimal price.

Our results extend the literature by showing that target analysts' coverage decisions reveal valuable information about a merged firm's future performance.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["merger and acquisition", "analyst coverage", "forecast accuracy", "merger performance"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Can Analysts Analyze Mergers?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1796", "ex:pages": "959-979", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "tehranih@bc.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Finance Department, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02467", "ex:name": "Hassan Tehranian"}, {"ex:email": "mengxin.zhao@ualberta.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Alberta School of Business, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2R6, Canada", "ex:name": "Mengxing Zhao"}, {"ex:email": "juliezhu@bu.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Accounting Department, Boston University School of Management, Boston, Massachusetts 02215; and Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200030 Shanghai, China", "ex:name": "Julie L.

We compare the two mechanisms in a controlled laboratory environment, varying the entry cost, and find that, contrary to the theoretical predictions, average seller revenues tend to be higher under the sequential mechanism, whereas average bidder profits are approximately the same. We identify three systematic behavioral deviations from the theoretical model: (1) in the auction, bidders do not enter 100% of the time; (2) in the sequential mechanism, bidders do not set preemptive bids according to the predicted threshold strategy; and (3) subsequent bidders tend to overenter in response to preemptive bids by first bidders.

Solving these kinds of optimization problems exactly requires a method that can generate the whole set of nondominated points (the Pareto-optimal front). In this paper, we first give a survey of the newly developed branch and bound methods for solving MOMIP problems.

The proposed method is able to find the full set of nondominated points. It is tested on a large number of problem instances, from six different classes of MOMIP problems. The results reveal that the developed biobjective branch and bound method performs better on five of the six test problems, compared with a generic two-phase method.

However, in a unique symmetric experiment that isolates the effect of market origin, we find evidence for the opposite: Although solutions provided by problem solvers from analogous markets show lower potential for immediate use, they demonstrate substantially higher levels of novelty. Also, compared to established novelty drivers, this effect appears highly relevant from a managerial perspective: we find that including problem solvers from analogous markets versus the target market accounts for almost two-thirds of the well-known effect of involving lead users instead of average problem solvers.

Extant treatments using likelihood-based estimators impose parametric distributional assumptions, such as normality, on the source of endogeneity. These assumptions are restrictive because misspecified distributions have an impact on parameter estimates and associated elasticities. The normality assumption for endogeneity can be inconsistent with some marginal cost specifications given a price-setting process, although they are consistent with other specifications. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous Bayesian semiparametric approach for modeling choice endogeneity that offers a flexible and robust alternative to parametric methods. Specifically, we construct centered Dirichlet process mixtures (CDPM) to allow uncertainty over the distribution of endogeneity errors. In a similar vein, we also model consumer preference heterogeneity nonparametrically via a CDPM. Results on simulated data show that incorrect distributional assumptions can lead to poor recovery of model parameters and price elasticities, whereas the proposed semiparametric model is able to robustly recover the true parameters in an efficient fashion. In addition, the CDPM offers the benefits of automatically inferring the number of mixture components that are appropriate for a given data set and is able to reconstruct the shape of the underlying distributions for endogeneity and heterogeneity errors. We apply our approach to two scanner panel data sets. Model comparison statistics indicate the superiority of the semiparametric specification and the results show that parameter and elasticity estimates are sensitive to the choice of distributional forms. Moreover, the CDPM specification yields evidence of multimodality, skewness, and outlying observations in these real data sets.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1811\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1811</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

This effect is driven entirely by benefits accrued under SERPs, consistent with SERPs more closely resembling risky corporate debt; balances accrued under RAF and ODC plans do not provide similar effects. Furthermore, promised yields are lower when debt-like compensation claims can be withdrawn only after outside debt claims are expected to settle. Our findings persist after accounting for endogeneity using state personal income tax rates as an instrument for CEOs' willingness to defer compensation. Overall, the evidence suggests that executive debt-like compensation is only effective at resolving stockholder--debtholder conflicts when its payoffs are truly debt-like and that lenders' perceptions are affected not only by the magnitude of debt-like compensation but also by its seniority.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["executive compensation", "inside debt", "debt-like compensation", "debt contracting"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Inside Debt and the Design of Corporate Debt Contracts", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1813", "ex:pages": "1260-1280", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "divyaa@rutgers.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Rutgers Business School, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102", "ex:name": "Divya Anantharaman"}, {"ex:email": "fangw@umn.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455", "ex:name": "Vivian W.

However, bidders can also strategically take advantage of this flexibility, by discounting package bids and \u201cinflating\u201d bid prices for single items, even in the absence of cost synergies; the latter behavior can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a given setting. In this paper, we develop a structural estimation approach that estimates the firms' cost structure using bidding data and use these estimates to evaluate the performance of the auction. To overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of bidders' behavior based on pricing package characteristics. We apply our method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government procures half a billion dollars' worth of meal services every year and bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that bidders' cost synergies are economically significant in this application ((sim)5%), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative efficiency ((sim)98%) and reasonable margins for the bidders ((sim)5%).

Efficient sourcing usually provides a cost advantage, whereas responsive sourcing allows a firm to obtain more accurate demand information when making procurement decisions. By characterizing the equilibrium outcome, we find some interesting results driven by the strategic interaction between the firms. First, a firm may still use efficient sourcing in equilibrium even when the cost advantage associated with efficient sourcing does not exist. This is because the firm can dampen competition by reducing the correlation between its own demand information and the competitor's. Second, a cost hike in efficient sourcing (e.g., the rising labor cost in Asia) may benefit all the firms in the industry. The reason is that the cost hike may alleviate competition by inducing a new equilibrium sourcing structure. This paper also sheds some light on the recent backshoring trend. First, our analysis indicates that more firms will shift from efficient sourcing to responsive sourcing in equilibrium (i.e., backshore) if the market size shrinks, the demand becomes more volatile, or the sourcing costs rise simultaneously. Second, a firm's backshoring behavior reduces the competition on the cost dimension, but it also has an ambiguous informational impact on the other firms in the market. In particular, some firms may benefit from increased correlation of their demand information under Cournot competition with substitutable products.

We combine a hierarchical Bayesian model estimated on approximately one million online sessions from Travelocity, together with randomized experiments using a real-world hotel search engine application. Our archival data analysis and randomized experiments are consistent in demonstrating the following: (1) A consumer-utility-based ranking mechanism can lead to a significant increase in overall search engine revenue. (2) Significant interplay occurs between search engine ranking and product ratings. An inferior position on the search engine affects \u201chigher-class\u201d hotels more adversely. On the other hand, hotels with a lower customer rating are more likely to benefit from being placed on the top of the screen. These findings illustrate that product search engines could benefit from directly incorporating signals from social media into their ranking algorithms. (3) Our randomized experiments also reveal that an \u201cactive\u201d personalized ranking system (wherein users can interact with and customize the ranking algorithm) leads to higher clicks but lower purchase propensities and lower search engine revenue compared with a \u201cpassive\u201d personalized ranking system (wherein users cannot interact with the ranking algorithm). This result suggests that providing more information during the decision-making process may lead to fewer consumer purchases because of information overload. Therefore, product search engines should not adopt personalized ranking systems by default. Overall, our study unravels the economic impact of ranking and its interaction with social media on product search engines.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["travel search engine", "randomized experiments", "hierarchical Bayesian methods", "information systems", "IT policy and management", "electronic commerce"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Examining the Impact of Ranking on Consumer Behavior and Search Engine Revenue", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1828", "ex:pages": "1632-1654", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "aghose@stern.nyu.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Information, Operations and Management Sciences, Department of Marketing, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012", "ex:name": "Anindya Ghose"}, {"ex:email": "panos@stern.nyu.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Information, Operations and Management Sciences, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012", "ex:name": "Panagiotis G.

First, arguing that consumers' political tendencies have an unutilized predictive power for marketing models, we allow consumers' heterogeneity to depend on their voting tendencies. Second, instead of relying on the commonly used genre classifications to characterize movies, we estimate latent movie attributes.

Box-office data over five years from 25 counties in the U.S. Midwest provide support for this model. First, consumers' preferences are related to their political tendencies.

This study builds on a large-scale randomized experiment of short message service (SMS) texts sent to 12,265 mobile users. We draw on contextual marketing theory to hypothesize how different combinations of mobile targeting determine consumer responses to mobile promotions. We identify that temporal targeting and geographical targeting individually increase sales purchases. Surprisingly, the sales effects of employing these two strategies simultaneously are not straightforward. When targeting proximal mobile users, our findings reveal a negative sales--lead time relationship; sending same-day mobile promotions yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases compared with sending them two days prior to the promoted event. However, when targeting nonproximal mobile users, there is an inverted-U, curvilinear relationship. Sending one-day prior SMSs yields an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 9.5 times compared with same-day SMSs and an increase in the odds of consumer purchases by 71% compared with two-day prior SMSs. These results are robust to unobserved heterogeneity, alternative estimation models, bootstrapped resamples, randomization checks, consumer mobile usage behavior, and segmentation of consumer scenarios. In addition, we conducted follow-up surveys to delve into the psychological mechanisms explaining the findings in our field experiment. In line with consumer construal arguments, consumers who received SMSs close (far) in time and location formed a more (less) concrete mental construal, which in turn, increased their involvement and purchase intent.

This phenomenon leads the firm to utilize the same price in multiple periods, in effect limiting the number of different prices that the service firm utilizes in optimal price policies. Also, when customers become more strategic (patient for service), the firm offers higher prices. This may lead to the underutilization of capacity, lower revenues, and reduced customer welfare.

We present a dynamic programming model for how the firm balances investments in customer acquisition and retention, as well as retention across multiple customer types. We characterize the optimal policy and discuss how the policy changes depending on capacity limitations. We then contrast the modeling results with those of a behavioral experiment in which subjects acted as managers making acquisition and retention decisions. In the modeling part of the paper, we introduce a concept of the value of an incremental customer (VIC), and show that when capacity is unlimited, VIC equals customer lifetime value (CLV), but when capacity is limited, VIC is much smaller and changes dynamically depending on the number of customers and their mix. As a result, the optimal spending is constant and depends on CLV for the firms with unlimited capacity, but changes dynamically and is generally unrelated to CLV when capacity is limited. In the experimental part, we introduce a concept of conditional optimality for the analysis of state-dependent decisions. Applying this concept to our data, we document a number of decision biases, specifically the subjects' tendency to overspend on retaining high-value customers and underspend on lower-value customers retention and acquisition. We show that providing CLV information exacerbates these biases and leads to a loss of net revenue when capacity is limited, but providing information about the marginal costs of acquisition and retention eliminated these biases and increases net revenue.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1842\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1842</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["behavioral operations", "revenue management", "limited capacity", "customer relationship management", "customer lifetime value"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Balancing Acquisition and Retention Spending for Firms with Limited Capacity", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1842", "ex:pages": "2002-2019", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "aovchinnikov@darden.virginia.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Darden Graduate School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903", "ex:name": "Anton Ovchinnikov"}, {"ex:email": "boulu-reshefb@darden.virginia.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Darden Graduate School of Business and Department of Economics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903", "ex:name": "B\u00e9atrice Boulu-Reshef"}, {"ex:email": "pfeiferp@darden.virginia.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Darden Graduate School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903", "ex:name": "Phillip E.

Upon receiving the feedback, the client reports her happiness level, which in turn determines the agent's payoff. In eight studies involving 928 subjects, we vary the way the agent's cash earnings depend on the client's reported happiness. When we make the agent's earnings proportional to the client's reported happiness, the agent inflates his feedback, and the client reports a higher level of happiness (than that reported in a control condition where the agent always provides honest feedback). We show that neither the agent nor the client behaves altruistically in their reporting. The client reports being happier because she overestimates her performance and mistakenly believes that the agent's feedback is genuine. The agent stops inflating his feedback when doing so no longer benefits him. Finally, our main findings are shown to be robust with respect to several factors, including making the agent's feedback consequential in affecting the client's payoff.

Using a buyer--seller trust game with a unilateral feedback scheme, we find that the seller's rebate decision has a significant impact on the buyer's purchasing decision via <i>signaling</i> the seller's cooperative type.

By setting various model constraints, the proposed framework incorporates different forms of serial correlation and promotion-specific dynamic effects. Using information model-selection heuristics, we select an optimal model of attendance drivers for the Pittsburgh Pirates' 2010--2012 MLB seasons. We demonstrate that our newly proposed model with an unrestricted serial correlation structure performs best. We find that although kids promotions have the highest direct effect on attendance, giveaway and entertainment promotions have substantial carryover effects and the largest total effects.

Common wisdom suggests that ticket resale is harmful to event organizers' revenues, and event organizers have tried to prevent resale of tickets.

We consider a model that allows resale from both consumers and speculators with different transaction costs for each party. Surprisingly, we find that this wisdom is incorrect when event organizers use fixed pricing policies; in fact, event organizers benefit from reductions in consumers' (and speculators') transaction costs of resale. Even when multiperiod pricing policies are used, we find that an event organizer may still benefit from ticket resale if his capacity is small. Although paperless ticketing is suggested as a way to reduce ticket resale and prevent speculators from buying tickets, our results suggest that it may reduce the capacity providers' revenues in many situations. Instead, we propose ticket options as a novel ticket pricing mechanism. We show that ticket options (where consumers would initially buy an option to buy a ticket and then exercise at a later date) naturally reduce ticket resale significantly and result in significant increases in event organizers' revenues.

We develop a methodology to overcome this endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet content is also useful to effect social change across countries. Content has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation.

We find that individuals learn rather quickly about their abilities to come up with high-potential ideas, but the learning regarding the firm's cost structure is quite slow. Contributors of low-potential ideas eventually become inactive, whereas the high-potential idea contributors remain active. As a result, over time, the average potential of generated ideas increases while the number of ideas contributed decreases. Hence, the decrease in the number of ideas generated represents market efficiency through self-selection rather than its failure. Through counterfactuals, we show that providing more precise cost signals to individuals can accelerate the filtering process. Increasing the total number of ideas to respond to and improving the response speed will lead to more idea contributions.

We demonstrate that consumption is affected by contract structure (pay-per-use versus three-part tariffs) even if the optimal consumption plans are identical. We find that, although there is extensive individual heterogeneity, on average, consumers' choices follow a structure that is similar to a nearly optimal heuristic and correctly react to imbalances between the number of free calls and call opportunities remaining. However, consumers use the free units too quickly, leading to overconsumption and lost surplus. These errors are partially driven by mistaken beliefs about the value distribution. We also measure subjects' willingness to pay for a contract with free access units, and we find that nearly half of subjects are willing to pay at least the full per-unit price, with a substantial fraction willing to overpay. In response, the optimal firm strategy offers a three-part tariff at a very small discount, which increases revenue by 8%--14% compared to only offering a pay-per-use contract.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1889\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1889</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Teck-Hua Ho, behavioral economics</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["economics", "behavior and behavioral decision making", "marketing", "pricing", "microeconomics", "intertemporal choice", "decision analysis", "applications", "industrial organization", "market structure", "firm strategy", "market performance"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Contracts, Biases, and Consumption of Access Services", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2013.1889", "ex:pages": "2198-2222", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "leider@umich.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Stephen M.

A proposed Bayesian estimation approach, based on recent advances in reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, can estimate parameters for the attribute-based finite mixture model, assuming that the number of components for each finite mixture is a discrete random variable. An attribute specification has several advantages over traditional, vector-based, finite mixture specifications; specifically, the attribute mixture model offers a more appropriate aggregation of information than does the vector specification facilitating estimation.

It is important to examine the above given the significant investments and the high failure rates associated with the introduction of new product extensions. In this study, we develop an analytical framework that derives revenue outcome due to an extension introduction as a function of spillover and extension effects. We empirically estimate the above effects through a Bayesian endogenous switching model that jointly models market shares of the extension and its parent brand along with the strategic decision to introduce the extension and the endogeneity in prices. By using a data set that covers 155 extensions introduced across 20 U.S. geographic markets, we obtain several new generalizable empirical insights. Our results show that spillover effects are higher for brand extensions, whereas line extensions benefit through larger extension effects. We find that vertically differentiating a line extension in terms of increased quality mitigates its negative spillover effects. The addition of a new brand name (i.e., sub-branding) lowers spillover effects for line extensions, whereas it increases the market performance for brand extensions.

We experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of origin---China versus the United States---affect trust, trustworthiness, and strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain. We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and trustworthiness than their U.S. counterparts do. We quantify the differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U.S. partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in general. This positive perception toward U.S. people is indeed consistent with the U.S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U.S. one does, as the prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to encourage trust by Chinese partners. Finally, we also observe that both populations exhibit similar pull-to-center bias when solving a decision problem under uncertainty (i.e., the newsvendor problem).Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1905\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1905</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["trust", "trustworthiness", "collectivism", "individualism", "western stereotypes", "HASH(0x14a21c0)", "China", "forecast information", "behavioral economics", "experimental economics"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Trust, Trustworthiness, and Information Sharing in Supply Chains Bridging China and the United States", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1905", "ex:pages": "2435-2460", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "oozer@utdallas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Jindal School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080", "ex:name": "\u00d6zalp \u00d6zer"}, {"ex:email": "yanchong@mit.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142", "ex:name": "Yanchong Zheng"}, {"ex:email": "reny@union.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Economics, Union College, Schenectady, New York 12308", "ex:name": "Yufei Ren"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we study the properties of a recently proposed class of semiparametric discrete choice models (referred to as the marginal distribution model (MDM)), by optimizing over a family of joint error distributions with prescribed marginal distributions.

Video sharing sites, social networks, online games, etc. all rely heavily on user-generated content and have been growing significantly in the last decade. We model a Hotelling style market in which consumers have heterogeneous tastes along a circular city. In a first step, we consider two ex ante identical firms whose offerings entirely depend on user-generated content. Consumers contribute content to the firm they join and benefit from the content provided by the others, their valuation being higher the closer the content contributor is to the content consumer (i.e., there are local network effects). In such a setting, we show that ex ante identical firms can acquire differentiated market positions that spontaneously emerge from user-generated content. Moreover, such differentiation may take interesting patterns, wherein a firm simultaneously attracts multiple distinct consumer segments that are isolated from each other. Greater segregation, measured by the number of disjoint segments in each platform, reduces consumer valuation for content, but interestingly, it intensifies firm competition. We show that this insight can help us refine the set of possible equilibria. In a second step, we consider firms that explicitly differentiate their offerings by generating some content on their own. We show that user-generated content may strengthen or defeat firms' intended positioning (i.e., firms attract consumers located opposite to their chosen positions) and consumer surplus may be higher in the latter case. Finally, we allow multihoming by consumers and show that the previous equilibrium patterns remain valid, but in most equilibria, a subset of consumers (located between rival firms' core clienteles) are multihomers. More multihoming consumers imply reduced differentiation and higher degree of platform competition. We relate these findings to anecdotal evidence and explore their strategic implications for competing firms relying on user-generated content.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

Use of all-electric drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["sustainable operations", "transportation", "business model innovation", "public policy", "electric vehicles"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Electric Vehicles with a Battery Switching Station: Adoption and Environmental Impact", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1916", "ex:pages": "772-794", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "buketavci@smu.edu.sg", "ex:affiliation": "Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, Singapore 178899", "ex:name": "Buket Avci"}, {"ex:email": "karan.girotra@insead.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, 77305 Fontainebleau, France", "ex:name": "Karan Girotra"}, {"ex:email": "serguei.netessine@insead.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Technology and Operations Management, INSEAD, Singapore 138676", "ex:name": "Serguei Netessine"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "Do hospitals experience safety tipping points as utilization increases, and if so, what are the implications for hospital operations management? We argue that safety tipping points occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82,280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5%. Among the 17% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has important implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity, because it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point. In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40% of the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a hospital system, because it reduces the likelihood that a patient will experience occupancy levels beyond the tipping point. Pooling the capacity of nearby hospitals in our sample reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 34%.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["hospital occupancy", "hospital mortality", "safety tipping point", "capacity pooling", "flexible staffing"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Stress on the Ward: Evidence of Safety Tipping Points in Hospitals", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1917", "ex:pages": "754-771", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "kuntz@wiso.uni-koeln.de", "ex:affiliation": "Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences, University of Cologne, 50923 Cologne, Germany", "ex:name": "Ludwig Kuntz"}, {"ex:email": "roman.mennicken@rwi-essen.de", "ex:affiliation": "Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lisches Institut f\u00fcr Wirtschaftsforschung, 45128 Essen, Germany", "ex:name": "Roman Mennicken"}, {"ex:email": "s.scholtes@jbs.cam.ac.uk", "ex:affiliation": "Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1AG, United Kingdom", "ex:name": "Stefan Scholtes"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "We examine if and how incumbent firms respond to entry and entry threats using nonprice modes of competition.

The project addressed a major operational resource allocation challenge that is typical to the industry. We study the resource allocation problem in which some of the tasks are scheduled and known in advance, and some are unpredictable and have to be addressed as they appear. The utility has maintenance crews that perform both standard jobs (each must be done before a specified deadline) as well as respond to emergency gas leaks (that occur randomly throughout the day and could disrupt the schedule and lead to significant overtime). The goal is to perform all the standard jobs by their respective deadlines, to address all emergency jobs in a timely manner, and to minimize maintenance crew overtime. We employ a novel decomposition approach that solves the problem in two phases. The first is a job scheduling phase, where standard jobs are scheduled over a time horizon. The second is a crew assignment phase, which solves a stochastic mixed integer program to assign jobs to maintenance crews under a stochastic number of future emergencies. For the first phase, we propose a heuristic based on the rounding of a linear programming relaxation formulation and prove an analytical worst-case performance guarantee. For the second phase, we propose an algorithm for assigning crews that is motivated by the structure of an optimal solution. We used our models and heuristics to develop a decision support tool that is being piloted in one of the utility's sites. Using the utility's data, we project that the tool will result in a 55% reduction in overtime hours.<i>This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, special issue on business analytics</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["resource allocation", "stochastic emergencies", "scheduling", "gas pipeline maintenance", "utility", "optimization"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Business Analytics for Flexible Resource Allocation Under Random Emergencies", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1919", "ex:pages": "1552-1573", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "m3an@pge.com", "ex:affiliation": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company, San Ramon, California 94583", "ex:name": "Mallik Angalakudati"}, {"ex:email": "sid@bloomreach.com", "ex:affiliation": "BloomReach, Mountain View, California 94041; and Leaders for Global Operations, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139", "ex:name": "Siddharth Balwani"}, {"ex:email": "jorge.calzada@nationalgrid.com", "ex:affiliation": "National Grid, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451", "ex:name": "Jorge Calzada"}, {"ex:email": "b2cl@pge.com", "ex:affiliation": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company, San Ramon, California 94583", "ex:name": "Bikram Chatterjee"}, {"ex:email": "georgiap@mit.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139", "ex:name": "Georgia Perakis"}, {"ex:email": "nicolas.raad@nationalgrid.com", "ex:affiliation": "National Grid, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451", "ex:name": "Nicolas Raad"}, {"ex:email": "uichanco@alum.mit.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Operations Research Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139", "ex:name": "Joline Uichanco"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "This study examines the stock-price reactions to analyst forecast revisions around earnings announcements to test whether preannouncement forecasts reflect analysts' private information or piggybacking on confounding events and news.

To assess the star as well as movie characteristics effects, we utilize a switching model to account for endogenous assignment of stars and nonstars into respective movie samples. In addition to controlling for selection biases, the endogenous switching model generates managerially relevant insights into the factors that influence a star's assignment to a movie. Additionally, because the star and nonstar movie characteristics (e.g., movie budget, distribution, genre, etc.) are often systematically different, we counterfactually estimate the theater allocations and revenues that nonstars (stars) <i>would have</i> generated had they acted in movies endowed with the same characteristics as the star (nonstar) movies. The decomposition analysis, conducted at different quantiles of theater and revenue distributions, shows that the presence of a star has a much stronger effect on theater allocations than the movie characteristics have.

Moreover, we find that the informative risk types do not necessarily increase the risk perceptions of investors---the disclosure of three types of systematic and liquidity risks will increase the risk perceptions of investors, whereas the other five types of unsystematic risks will decrease them.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1930\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1930</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Alok Gupta, special issue on business analytics</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["topic modeling", "latent Dirichlet allocation", "text analysis", "econometric analysis", "risk disclosures"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Simultaneously Discovering and Quantifying Risk Types from Textual Risk Disclosures", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1930", "ex:pages": "1371-1391", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "baoyang9527@gmail.com", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Information Systems, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417", "ex:name": "Yang Bao"}, {"ex:email": "datta@comp.nus.edu.sg", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Information Systems, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417", "ex:name": "Anindya Datta"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "We study assortment optimization problems where customer choices are governed by the nested logit model and there are constraints on the set of products offered in each nest.

Our research builds on prior literature on physician productivity, IT productivity, and task--technology fit theory. We use a unique panel data set comprising 87 physicians specializing in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family practice, located in 12 primary care clinics of an academic healthcare system in the western United States. We employ the Arellano--Bond system generalized method of moments estimation technique on our data set, which contains 3,186 physician-month productivity observations collected over 39 months. We find that productivity drops sharply immediately after technology implementation and recovers partly over the next few months. The ultimate, longer-term impact depends on physician specialty. The net impact of the EMR system is more benign on internal medicine physicians than on pediatricians and family practitioners. We postulate that the fit provided by an EMR system to the task requirements of physicians of various specialties may be key to disentangling the productivity dynamics. Our research finds that on one hand, present-day EMR systems do not produce the kind of productivity gain that could lead to substantial savings in healthcare; at the same time, EMRs do not cause a major productivity loss on a sustained basis, as many physicians fear.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["Arellano--Bond GMM estimation", "dynamic panel model", "electronic medical records", "EMR", "EMR productivity", "health informatics", "IT productivity", "physician learning", "physician productivity", "task--technology fit", "work relative value units"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Electronic Medical Records and Physician Productivity: Evidence from Panel Data Analysis", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1934", "ex:pages": "2543-2562", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "hemantb@ucdavis.edu", "ex:affiliation": "UC Davis Graduate School of Management, University of California, Davis, Davis, California 15616", "ex:name": "Hemant K.

In the dynamic negotiation process, the seller can screen, whereas the buyer can signal information through their offers, and the buyer has an <i>endogenous</i> and <i>type-dependent</i> reservation profit. With rational assumptions on the seller's belief structure, we characterize the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the bargaining game. Interestingly, we find that both quantity distortion and information rent may be avoided depending on the firms' relative patience, and the seller may reach an agreement with either the high type or the low type first, or with both simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore our model to characterize the effect of demand forecasting accuracy on firm profitability. We find that improved demand forecast benefits the buyer but hurts the seller when the buyer's forecasting accuracy is low. However, once the buyer's forecasting accuracy exceeds a threshold, both firms will benefit from further improvement of the forecast. This observation makes an interesting contrast to previous findings based on the one-shot principal--agent model, in which improvement of forecasting accuracy mostly leads to a win--lose outcome for the two firms, and the buyer has an incentive to improve his forecasting accuracy only when it is extremely low.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["dynamic bargaining", "asymmetric information", "screening", "signaling", "forecasting accuracy"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Dynamic Bargaining in a Supply Chain with Asymmetric Demand Information", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1938", "ex:pages": "301-315", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "annabellefeng@purdue.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907", "ex:name": "Qi Feng"}, {"ex:email": "guoming.lai@mccombs.utexas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712", "ex:name": "Guoming Lai"}, {"ex:email": "lauren_lu@unc.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599", "ex:name": "Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "Motivated by the availability of real-time data on customer characteristics, we consider the problem of personalizing the assortment of products for each arriving customer.

We first evaluate two common wholesale price contracts that differ in which party incurs the risk associated with unsold inventory: a push contract in which the retailer incurs the risk and a pull contract in which the supplier incurs the risk. Our experimental results show that a pull contract achieves higher channel efficiency than that of a push contract, and that behavior systematically deviates from the standard theory in three ways: (1) stocking quantities are set too low, (2) wholesale prices are more favorable to the party stocking the inventory, and (3) some contracts are erroneously accepted or rejected. To account for these systematic regularities, we extend the existing theory and structurally estimate a number of behavioral models. The estimates suggest that a combination of loss aversion with errors organizes our data remarkably well. We apply our behavioral model to the advance purchase discount (APD) contract, which combines features of push and pull by allowing both parties to share the inventory risk, in a separate experiment as an out-of-sample test, and we find that it accurately predicts channel efficiency and qualitatively matches decisions. Two practical implications of our work are that (1) the push contract performs close to standard theoretical benchmarks, which implies that it is robust to behavioral biases, and (2) the APD contract weakly Pareto dominates the push contract; retailers are better off and suppliers are no worse off under the APD contract.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1940\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1940</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["behavioral operations management", "inventory risk allocation", "supply chain contracts"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Push, Pull, or Both?

In this paper, we build a structural econometric model to quantify the vibrant platform competition between mobile (smartphone and tablet) apps on the Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and estimate consumer preferences toward different mobile app characteristics. We find that app demand increases with the in-app purchase option wherein a user can complete transactions within the app. On the contrary, app demand decreases with the in-app advertisement option where consumers are shown ads while they are engaging with the app. The direct effects on app revenue from the inclusion of an in-app purchase option and an in-app advertisement option are equivalent to offering a 28% price discount and increasing the price by 8%, respectively. We also find that a price discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Google Play compared with Apple App Store, and app developers can maximize their revenue by providing a 50% discount on their paid apps. Using the estimated demand function, we find that mobile apps have enhanced consumer surplus by approximately $33.6 billion annually in the United States, and we discuss various implications for mobile marketing analytics, app pricing, and app design strategies.<i>This paper was accepted by Alok Gupta, special issue on business analytics</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["mobile apps", "demand estimation", "Apple", "Google", "app characteristics", "in-app purchases", "in-app advertising", "mobile analytics", "mobile marketing"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Estimating Demand for Mobile Applications in the New Economy", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1945", "ex:pages": "1470-1488", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "aghose@stern.nyu.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Leonard N.

We report on laboratory experiments that identify causal factors determining the willingness of buyers to pay voluntarily under PWYW. Furthermore, to see how competition affects the viability of PWYW, we implement markets in which a PWYW seller competes with a traditional seller. Finally, we endogenize the market structure and let sellers choose their pricing strategy. The experimental results show that outcome-based social preferences and strategic considerations to keep the seller in the market can explain why and how much buyers pay voluntarily to a PWYW seller. We find that PWYW can be viable on a monopolistic market, but it is less successful as a competitive strategy because it does not drive traditional posted-price sellers out of the market. Instead, the existence of a posted-price competitor reduces buyers' payments and prevents the PWYW seller from fully penetrating the market. When given the choice, most sellers opt for setting a posted price rather than a PWYW pricing strategy.

By deferring product assignments, a firm is able to obtain more information about demand for each specific product before deciding which product to assign to consumers. However, our analysis demonstrates that PS can be an effective inventory-management mechanism even if the firm allocates products before knowing which product will be more popular and, thus, scarcer. Interestingly, we show that it can be more profitable for the firm to allocate products to consumers before, rather than after, learning the true demand for a product because, although early allocation imposes higher inventory costs (as a result of larger required inventory levels), it also enables the firm to charge higher prices. Our results also reveal that, when introducing probabilistic goods, the firm should order less inventory (relative to the case where probabilistic goods are not offered) if costs are very low but more inventory otherwise.

We incorporate individual random effects to account for consumer heterogeneity and cast the model in the Bayesian hierarchical framework.

The costs of using a PSP are derived when both suppliers are of low reliability, from the loss of direct control over the supplier\u2019s production actions, which leads to reduced supply availability and increased informational costs, and from the PSP facilitating implicit supplier collusion.

We confirm these statements in two ways. First, we show the following analytical result: when demand is composed of a <i>base</i> demand random component plus a <i>surge</i> demand random component, which occurs with a certain small probability, the best TBS policy is close to optimal (over all policies) in a well-defined sense. Second, we also numerically investigate the cost effectiveness of the best TBS policy on a test bed of problem instances. The emphasis of this investigation is the study of the effect of the lead time difference between the two suppliers. Our study reveals that the cost difference between the best TBS policy and the optimal policy decreases dramatically as the lead time of the regular supplier increases. On our test bed, this cost difference decreases from an average (over the test bed) of 21% when the lead time from the regular supplier is two periods (the emergency supplier offers instant delivery) to 3.5% when that lead time is seven periods.<i>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["inventory/production systems", "dual sourcing", "multiple suppliers", "optimal policies"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Analysis of Tailored Base-Surge Policies in Dual Sourcing Inventory Systems", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1971", "ex:pages": "1547-1561", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "ganesh@utdallas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080", "ex:name": "Ganesh Janakiraman"}, {"ex:email": "sridhar_seshadri@isb.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Indian School of Business, Gachibowli, Hyderabad 500032, India", "ex:name": "Sridhar Seshadri"}, {"ex:email": "sheopuri@us.ibm.com", "ex:affiliation": "Business Insight Group, IBM Thomas J.

Yet controversies exist over the influence of copyright protection on firm profitability. The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative rationale for the growing anti-protection trend and to investigate optimal copyright enforcement and quality provision in a monopoly setting. The proposed economic mechanism centers on the influence of copyright protection on consumer search when consumers can get to know the firm\u2019s actions (e.g., price, quality) only after costly search. We show that more stringent copyright protection can induce the consumers to rationally expect lower ex post surplus, thus exerting a negative strategic effect on the consumers' willingness to search. This strategic effect may outweigh the positive main effect on the relative attractiveness of the authorized versus the pirated product, which can hence explain the optimality of incomplete and even zero copyright protection policies in markets where consumer prepurchase search is important (e.g., information goods, digital products). It is also because of this strategic effect that the firm may provide lower quality as copyright enforcement increases. Interestingly, quality unobservability can moderate this strategic effect and thus lead to an increasing incentive for copyright protection.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["copyright", "piracy", "quality", "search"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Digital Content Provision and Optimal Copyright Protection", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1972", "ex:pages": "1183-1196", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "liangguo@baf.cuhk.edu.hk", "ex:affiliation": "CUHK Business School, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China", "ex:name": "Liang Guo"}, {"ex:email": "xiangyi.meng@cufe.edu.cn", "ex:affiliation": "China Academy of Public Finance and Public Policy at the Central University of Finance and Economics, 100081 Beijing, China", "ex:name": "Xiangyi Meng"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "In a stochastic interdiction game a proliferator aims to minimize the expected duration of a nuclear weapons development project, and an interdictor endeavors to maximize the project duration by delaying some of the project tasks.

A key aspect of the problem is that each product is short-lived in the sense that, once introduced, its attractiveness lasts only a few periods and vanishes over time. The objective is to determine when to introduce each product to maximize the total profit over the selling season. Even for two periods, the corresponding optimization problem is shown to be NP-complete. As a result, we study a continuous relaxation of the problem that approximates the problem well, when the number of products is large. When margins are identical and product preferences decay exponentially, its solution can be characterized: it is optimal to introduce products with slower decays earlier.

It involves a series of complex processes that transform inputs with a wide range of quality characteristics into refined finished products sold to end markets. In this paper, we take the perspective of a profit-maximizing refiner that considers upgrading its existing simple refinery to include intermediate-conversion flexibility, i.e., the capability of converting heavy intermediate components to light ones. We present a stylized two-stage stochastic programming model of a petroleum refinery to investigate the value drivers of conversion flexibility and the impact of input and output market conditions on its economic potential. Conversion flexibility adds value to refineries by either transforming a nonprofitable situation into a profitable one (referred to as purchase benefit) or improving profitability of an already profitable situation (referred to as unit revenue benefit). In a real-data-calibrated numerical study, we find the value of conversion flexibility (VoC) to be significant, accounting for 40% of the expected profit with conversion, and the purchase benefit and unit revenue benefit are equally important. Contrary to the intuition that, as a recourse action, conversion offers higher value for greater input price volatility, we find that VoC may decrease in input price volatility as a result of the differential impacts of increasing price volatility on the purchase benefit and the unit revenue benefit. Refineries also vary in their range flexibility, i.e., the ability to accommodate a narrow or wide range of inputs of different quality levels. Whether the range flexibility increases or decreases the value of conversion flexibility is affected by the direction in which the refinery expands its processing range and the heaviness of crude oils.<i>This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["operational flexibility", "oil refining", "petroleum industry", "spot markets", "stochastic models"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "The Value of Operational Flexibility in the Presence of Input and Output Price Uncertainties with Oil Refining Applications", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1996", "ex:pages": "2908-2926", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "60", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2014", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "dong@wustl.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130", "ex:name": "Lingxiu Dong"}, {"ex:email": "kouvelis@wustl.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130", "ex:name": "Panos Kouvelis"}, {"ex:email": "wuxiaole@fudan.edu.cn", "ex:affiliation": "School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China", "ex:name": "Xiaole Wu"}]}, {"ex:issue": "4", "ex:abstract": "This paper investigates the mechanism through which short selling of a bank's stocks can trigger the failure of the bank.

In this paper we formalize this combined optimization problem as a multiobjective stochastic control problem and derive an efficient policy for online ad allocation in settings with general joint distribution over placement quality and exchange prices. We prove the asymptotic optimality of this policy in terms of any arbitrary trade-off between the quality of delivered reservation ads and revenue from the exchange, and we show that our policy approximates any Pareto-optimal point on the quality-versus-revenue curve.

Each agent in the market has an unknown independent private valuation that determines the distribution of the reward she obtains from the good; for example, in sponsored search settings, advertisers may initially be unsure of the value of a click. Though the induced dynamic game is complex, we simplify analysis of the market using an approximation methodology known as <i>mean field equilibrium</i> (MFE). The methodology assumes that agents optimize only with respect to long-run average estimates of the distribution of other players' bids. We show a remarkable fact: In a mean field equilibrium, the agent has an optimal strategy where she bids truthfully according to a <i>conjoint valuation</i>. The conjoint valuation is the sum of her current expected valuation, together with an overbid amount that is exactly the expected marginal benefit of one additional observation about her true private valuation. Under mild conditions on the model, we show that an MFE exists, and that it is a good approximation to a rational agent\u2019s behavior as the number of agents increases. Formally, if every agent except one follows the MFE strategy, then the remaining agent\u2019s loss on playing the MFE strategy converges to zero as the number of agents in the market increases. We conclude by discussing the implications of the auction format and design on the auctioneer\u2019s revenue.

In modern business and society, there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified, flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with results similar to those achieved by using the original databases. Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases. Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing data-masking methods.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\"  href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Sandra Slaughter, information systems</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["database", "digital economy", "innovation", "nonparametric", "perturbation", "privacy", "shuffling"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Drive More Effective Data-Based Innovations: Enhancing the Utility of Secure Databases", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2026", "ex:pages": "520-541", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "yi.qian@sauder.ubc.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Marketing and Behavioral Science, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z2, Canada", "ex:name": "Yi Qian"}, {"ex:email": "huixie@uic.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612", "ex:name": "Hui Xie"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "Adaptive estimation methods have become a popular tool for capturing and forecasting changing conditions in dynamic environments.

In particular, customers arrive over time, are strategic in timing their purchases, and are heterogeneous along two dimensions: their valuation for the firm\u2019s product and their willingness to wait before purchasing or leaving. The customers' patience and valuation may be correlated in an arbitrary fashion. For this general formulation, we prove that the firm may restrict attention to cyclic pricing policies, which have length, at most, twice the maximum willingness to wait of the customer population. To efficiently compute optimal policies, we develop a dynamic programming approach that uses a novel state space that is general, capable of handling arbitrary problem primitives, and that generalizes to finite horizon problems with nonstationary parameters. We analyze the class of monotone pricing policies and establish their suboptimality in general. Optimal policies are, in a typical scenario, characterized by nested sales, where the firm offers partial discounts throughout each cycle, offers a significant discount halfway through the cycle, and holds its largest discount at the end of the cycle.

I identify the critical role that demand correlation plays with the fixed proportions technology: in contrast to the capacity-pooling value, which <i>decreases</i> in demand correlation, the cost-pooling value <i>increases</i> in demand correlation. Second, focusing on the fixed proportions technology, I study supply management in the presence of contract and spot markets. I investigate how the optimal supply management strategy should respond to changing market uncertainties, and the differences in this response based on the contract type. I find that when the exercise price of the contract is high, a higher contract market dependence is the best response to the increasing demand correlation or spot price variability. However, a lower contract market dependence is the best response to the same when the exercise price is low. Managerially, these results are important because they imply that the supply management strategy adopted as a response to a change in the business environment should differ depending on the contract type.

The shift from immature to mature submarkets can lead to a shakeout in firm numbers, and it eventually leads to a reduction in total dynamic capabilities in an industry.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["economics", "microeconomic behavior", "industrial organization", "firm objectives", "organization and behavior dynamic programming", "applications"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "A Theory of Market Pioneers, Dynamic Capabilities, and Industry Evolution", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2064", "ex:pages": "1598-1614", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "matthew.mitchell@rotman.utoronto.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Graduate Department of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada", "ex:name": "Matthew Mitchell"}, {"ex:email": "skrz@stanford.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305", "ex:name": "Andrzej Skrzypacz"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of analyst recommendations issued after a merger announcement on deal completion.

These findings potentially have important implications for the application of field experiments.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for a specific, complex market, we introduce a compact bidding language for TV advertising markets and investigate the resulting winner-determination problem and the computation of core payments. For realistic instances of the respective winner-determination problems, very good solutions with a small integrality gap can be found quickly, although closing the integrality gap to find marginally better solutions or prove optimality can take a prohibitively large amount of time. Our subsequent adaptation of a constraint-generation technique for the computation of bidder-optimal core payments to this environment is a practically viable paradigm by which core-selecting auction designs can be applied to large markets with potentially hundreds of items. Such auction designs allow bidders to express their preferences with a low number of parameters, while at the same time providing incentives for truthful bidding.

This paper presents empirical tests of this policy using aggregate, firm-level data. First, we extend a single-item adaptive base stock policy in previous literature to a multi-item case. Second, we transform the policy derived for the multi-item case to a regression model that relates firm-level inventory purchases to firm-level sales and changes in sales forecasts. We focus on two research questions: Can the adaptive base stock policy explain cross-sectional ordering behaviors under sales growth? To the extent that the adaptive base stock policy fails to explain ordering behaviors under sales growth, are there frictions that explain such a finding? Our empirical results demonstrate disparities in ordering behaviors between firms experiencing high and moderate sales growth. Contrary to theoretical prediction, this implies that inventory purchases are a function of not only current sales and changes in sales forecast but also past sales growth.

In addition, we find that firms' inventory holding risks may also be affected by purchasing constraints imposed by supply chain contracts.

Prior research on branding and brand extension has primarily focused on how branding influences consumers\u2019 perceptions of product quality. However, consumers of conspicuous goods care not only about product quality but also about the profile of its users. For example, high-end consumers prefer an exclusive brand. On the other hand, low-end consumers may find a brand more attractive if high-end consumers use it. In this paper, we analyze how social effects and market structure can influence the branding of conspicuous goods. Consistent with intuition, our theoretical analysis shows that a monopolist would prefer not to use umbrella branding when consumers\u2019 desire for uniqueness is high. By contrast, in a competitive market, umbrella branding is more profitable than individual branding when consumers have a high level of desire for uniqueness. We also identify conditions in which it is optimal for marketers of conspicuous goods to adopt either an individual branding strategy or asymmetric branding strategies. Furthermore, competing firms may offer umbrella branding even when both firms may be better off if they could commit to using individual branding. Finally, we extend the model to consider a market where consumers\u2019 product preference is not related to social status. Again, if consumers are sufficiently snobbish, competing firms earn more profits by adopting an umbrella branding strategy instead of an individual branding strategy.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier\u2019s incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor\u2019s predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy. Together these effects stress that a firm\u2019s bankruptcy potential can hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers. They also provide guidelines for firms\u2019 operational decisions in such situations, a rationale for observed firm actions surrounding bankruptcies, and motivation for policies supporting reorganization and relaxing broad enforcement of nondiscriminatory pricing regulations.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["operations\u2013finance interface", "supply chain interaction", "operational competitiveness", "bankruptcy", "Chapter 11", "reorganization", "liquidation", "externality"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "The Supply Chain Effects of Bankruptcy", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2079", "ex:pages": "2320-2338", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2015", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "sayang@london.edu", "ex:affiliation": "London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom", "ex:name": "S.

There are multiple well-known rival mechanisms that compete to be the explanation for this observed clustering. These range from peer influence to homophily to other unobservable external stimuli. These multiple mechanisms lead to similar observational data, yet have vastly different policy implications. In this paper, we present a novel randomized experiment that tests the existence of causal peer influence in the general population\u2014one that did not involve subject recruitment for experimentation\u2014of a particular large-scale online social network. We utilize a unique social feature to exogenously induce adoption of a paid service among a group of randomly selected users, and in the process develop a clean exogenous randomization of treatment and control groups. A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference to ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival models, yield close to identical, statistically and economically significant estimates of peer influence in the general population of a freemium social network. Our estimates show that peer influence causes more than a 60% increase in odds of buying the service due to the influence coming from an adopting friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller number of friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the users with a larger number of friends. Our nonparametric resampling procedure-based estimates are helpful in situations of networked data that violate independence assumptions.

I argue that policy makers' dependencies, motivations, and decision-making processes lead them to evaluate firms by using sociopolitical reputation as a differentiating heuristic. I hypothesize that firms that construct stronger sociopolitical reputations will be granted greater access and that firms' existing political activity and policy makers' partisanship will moderate this relationship. I test these hypotheses using an 11-year panel on congressional testimony, reputation, and political and financial characteristics for the S&P 500 and find support for all three.

The firm operates under a capital budget for financing the capacity investment, and an operating budget, which is uncertain in the capacity investment stage, for financing the production. We investigate how the tightening of the capital budget and a lower financial flexibility in the production stage (the likelihood of having a sufficient operating budget) shape the optimal technology choice. We find that the dominant regime is one where dedicated technology should be adopted for a larger investment cost range, and thus, is the best response to the tighter capital budget, whereas flexible technology is the best response to lower financial flexibility. We identify the key roles that the capacity intensity (the ratio of unit capacity cost to total unit capacity and production cost) of each technology and the pooling value of operating budget with dedicated technology, which brings this technology closer to flexible technology in terms of the resource network\u2019s flexibility, play in a budget-constrained environment.

To gain insights into reducing this waiting time, we study operations in the inpatient wards and their interface with the ED. We focus on understanding the effect of inpatient discharge policies and other operational policies on the time-of-day waiting time performance, such as the fraction of patients waiting longer than six hours in the ED before being admitted. Based on an empirical study at a Singaporean hospital, we propose a novel stochastic processing network with the following characteristics to model inpatient operations: (1) A patient\u2019s service time in the inpatient wards depends on that patient\u2019s admission and discharge times and length of stay. The service times capture a two-time-scale phenomenon and are not independent and identically distributed. (2) Pre- and post-allocation delays model the extra amount of waiting caused by secondary bottlenecks other than bed unavailability, such as nurse shortage. (3) Patients waiting for a bed can overflow to a nonprimary ward when the waiting time reaches a threshold, where the threshold is time dependent. We show, via simulation studies, that our model is able to capture the inpatient flow dynamics at hourly resolution and can evaluate the impact of operational policies on both the daily and time-of-day waiting time performance. In particular, our model predicts that implementing a hypothetical policy can eliminate excessive waiting for those patients who request beds in mornings. This policy incorporates the following components: a discharge distribution with the first discharge peak between 8 <sc>a.m.</sc> and 9 <sc>a.m.</sc> and 26% of patients discharging before noon, and constant-mean allocation delays throughout the day.

Analogously, the model can also rationalize a seemingly ad hoc feature of the U.S. tax system, which subsidizes the conflict of interest between debt and equity regarding firm liquidation.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["war of attrition with asymmetric information", "externality", "endogenous types", "debt tax shield", "capital structure", "tax policy"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Debt and Creative Destruction: Why Could Subsidizing Corporate Debt Be Optimal?", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2120", "ex:pages": "303-325", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "zhiguo.he@chicagobooth.edu", "ex:affiliation": "University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois 60637; and National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138", "ex:name": "Zhiguo He"}, {"ex:email": "gregor.matvos@chicagobooth.edu", "ex:affiliation": "University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois 60637; and National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138", "ex:name": "Gregor Matvos"}]}, {"ex:issue": "2", "ex:abstract": "Extant theory claims a firm\u2019s information environment impacts the choice between debt and equity financing.

This loss takes place when suppliers commit to prices up front, before any possible forecast change, but not when they delay the price quotes after demand forecasts have been updated. Specifically, with up-front price commitment, dual sourcing leads to inflation of supplier prices because expensive suppliers will still receive part of the business if they are sufficiently quick. Thus, when supplier prices are endogenous, double marginalization may offset the additional buyer profit enabled by higher ordering flexibility.

Two salient behavioral motives that impact consumers\u2019 purchase decisions and the seller\u2019s optimal strategies are anticipated regret and misperception of product availability. Regret arises when a consumer initially chooses to wait but encounters stockout later, or when the consumer buys the product at the high price but realizes that the product is still available at the markdown price. In addition, consumers often perceive the product\u2019s future availability to be different than its actual availability. We determine and quantify that both regret and availability misperception have significant operational and profit implications for the seller. For example, ignoring these behavioral factors can result in up to 10% profit losses. We contrast the roles of consumers\u2019 strategic (pecuniary) motives with their behavioral (nonpecuniary) motives in affecting purchase, pricing, and inventory decisions.

The standard mathematical formulation for a bandit problem makes the strong assumption that the decision maker has a full characterization of the joint distribution of the rewards, and that \u201carms\u201d under this distribution are independent. These assumptions are not satisfied in many applications, and the out-of-sample performance of policies that optimize a misspecified model can be poor. Motivated by these concerns, we formulate a robust bandit problem in which a decision maker accounts for distrust in the nominal model by solving a worst-case problem against an adversary (\u201cnature\u201d) who has the ability to alter the underlying reward distribution and does so to minimize the decision maker\u2019s expected total profit. Structural properties of the optimal worst-case policy are characterized by using the robust Bellman (dynamic programming) equation, and arms are shown to be no longer independent under nature\u2019s worst-case response. One implication of this is that index policies are not optimal for the robust problem, and we propose, as an alternative, a robust version of the Gittins index. Performance bounds for the robust Gittins index are derived by using structural properties of the value function together with ideas from stochastic dynamic programming duality. We also investigate the performance of the robust Gittins index policy when applied to a Bayesian webpage design problem.

For fast storage (a storage facility that can both be fully emptied and filled up in one decision period), we show analytically that negative prices can substantially alter the optimal storage policy structure, e.g., all else being equal, it can be optimal to empty an almost empty storage facility and fill up an almost full one. For more typical slow grid-level electricity storage, we numerically establish that ignoring negative prices could result in a considerable loss of value when negative prices occur more than 5% of the time. Negative prices raise another possibility: rather than storing surpluses, a merchant might buy negatively priced electricity surpluses and dispose of them, e.g., using load banks. We find that the value of such a disposal strategy is substantial, e.g., about $118 per kilowatt-year when negative prices occur 10% of the time, but smaller than that of the storage strategy, e.g., about $391 per kilowatt-year using a typical battery.

This study contributes to the literature by identifying a key technological factor that affects government spending and showing that IT investments can be a means to restrain government growth.<i>This paper was accepted by Anandhi Bharadwaj, information systems.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["IT investments", "government growth", "U.S. state government", "CIO budgets"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Do CIO IT Budgets Explain Bigger or Smaller Governments?

Drawing on extensive quantitative data on approximately 450,000 microfinance loans made by a microfinance institution in Mexico from 2004 to 2008 that include random assignment of loan officers, this research proposes the concept of \u201drelational styles\u201d to help explain how repeated exchange is possible in the face of personnel change. We define relational styles as systematically reoccurring patterns of interaction employed by social actors within and across exchange relationships\u2014in this paper, between microfinance clients and loan officers.

We also demonstrate that consistency in the relational styles followed by successive loan officers mitigates the negative impact of a broken loan officer\u2013client tie.

First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games.

We observe their real-time responses to the two failures and whether they contribute an improvement idea.

A second experiment with a 2 \u00d7 2 design shows that participants in the difficult condition who have high access to the process owner are more likely to use policy-compliant workarounds than when they have low access. Our results suggest that hospitals can increase communication about operational failures by deliberately making it difficult to work around them while simultaneously providing a high level of access to process owners.

The goal of this study is to provide recommendations that address the quality problem with minimal testing. Interestingly, some intuitive interventions\u2014such as providing stations with better infrastructure (e.g., storage and refrigeration facilities) or subsidizing testing costs\u2014could hurt the quality of milk in the presence of competition. To save testing costs we utilize mixed testing, where the milk combined from multiple farmers is tested once. However, mixed testing makes the system vulnerable to free-riding among farmers. We counter free-riding by applying a credible threat of individual testing (although not its actual use in equilibrium). We then propose two interventions to combat the harmful competition among stations. The novelty of our proposals lies in utilizing the force of competition to solve a problem created by competition. The incentives in our proposals provide a new tool for the stations to compete and convert the harmful effect of competition (quality reduction) into a beneficial one (quality improvement), resulting in a socially desirable equilibrium outcome: all the farmers provide high-quality milk and each competing station conducts only one mixed test and no further testing.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["milk supply chain", "adulteration", "competition", "inspection", "moral hazard"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Milking the Quality Test: Improving the Milk Supply Chain Under Competing Collection Intermediaries", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2171", "ex:pages": "1259-1277", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "muliying@udel.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware 19716", "ex:name": "Liying Mu"}, {"ex:email": "milind@utdallas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080", "ex:name": "Milind Dawande"}, {"ex:email": "geng@utdallas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080", "ex:name": "Xianjun Geng"}, {"ex:email": "vijay@utdallas.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080", "ex:name": "Vijay Mookerjee"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "For many consumer-intensive (i.e., business-to-consumer) services, delivering memorable customer experiences is a source of competitive advantage.

We quantify how demand uncertainty impacts the various players (government, industry, and consumers) when designing policies. We further show that, for convex demand functions, an increase in demand uncertainty leads to higher production quantities and lower prices, resulting in lower profits for the supplier. With this in mind, one could expect consumer surplus to increase with uncertainty. In fact, we show that this is not always the case and that the uncertainty impact on consumer surplus depends on the trade-off between lower prices and the possibility of underserving customers with high valuations. We also show that when policy makers such as governments ignore demand uncertainty when designing consumer subsidies, they can significantly miss the desired adoption target level.

This is a common scheme not only in transportation. In close collaboration with the public transportation agency of the city of Bologna, Italy, we designed a methodology to optimize some aspects of the contractual relationship between that agency and the bus operator. We focus on the fines specified by the contract when the operator fails to comply with the service level it has agreed to provide, and on a procedure to measure that service level. Our approach has the advantage that it aligns the incentives of both parties to the benefit of bus riders. We model the agency\u2013operator relationship as a multistage game and find its equilibrium to establish the best operating regime. The game-theoretical approach provides expressions for the fines that the operator should be charged if it does not satisfy the contracted services, and for the optimal agency\u2019s budget to devote to control activities. Second, to check the compliance of the operator with the schedule specified by the contract in a resource-efficient way, we compute how to position the agency\u2019s employees to verify if buses are running according to the specifications of the contract.

We first analytically characterize the exact coalition-proof Nash-stable coalition structures that would arise for symmetric complementary or substitutable suppliers. Our analysis reveals that it is the appeal of default risk mitigation, rather than competition reduction, that motivates cooperation. In general, a riskier and/or less fragmented supply base favors larger alliances, whereas substitutable suppliers and customer demands with lower pass-through rates result in smaller ones. We then characterize the stable coalition structures for an asymmetric supplier base. We establish that grand coalition is more stable when the supplier base is more homogeneous in terms of their risk levels, rather than divided among a few highly risky suppliers and other low-risk ones. Going one step further, our investigation of endogenous recourse fund levels for the suppliers demonstrates how financing costs affect suppliers\u2019 investments in risk-reducing resources and, consequently, their coalition formation strategy.

Diversity, on the one hand, facilitates the access to and integration of a wide variety of information; on the other hand, it may cause conflict and hurt group performance. Although diversity\u2019s effects have been the subject of many studies in offline work groups (with the results remaining inconclusive), its effects in online self-organizing groups are underexplored. In this paper, we examine 648 WikiProjects to understand (1) how tenure disparity and interest variety affect group productivity and member withdrawal and (2) how the two types of diversity evolve over time. Our results show a curvilinear effect of tenure disparity, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal, up to a point. Beyond that point, productivity slightly decreases, and members are more likely to withdraw. In comparison, our results show a positive effect of interest variety on productivity and no significant effects on withdrawal. We also find that, over a project\u2019s life cycle, tenure disparity decreases and interest variety increases, with both converging toward the level that is optimal for group performance. Overall, our study highlights the importance of having diverse experiences and perspectives in online open collaboration and the power of self-organizing that helps groups evolve toward their high-performing zones. It also has practical implications on the design of collaboration tools and new forms of organizing work in traditional organizations.<i>This paper was accepted by Sandra Slaughter, information systems</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["online open collaboration", "self-organizing groups", "diversity", "group performance", "Wikipedia"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "The Impact and Evolution of Group Diversity in Online Open Collaboration", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2178", "ex:pages": "1668-1686", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "chingren@umn.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455", "ex:name": "Yuqing Ren"}, {"ex:email": "chenjilin@gmail.com", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455", "ex:name": "Jilin Chen"}, {"ex:name": "John Riedl", "ex:affiliation": "Formerly at Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota"}]}, {"ex:issue": "5", "ex:abstract": "Newly public companies tend to exhibit abnormally high accruals in the year of their initial public offering (IPO).

This suggests that a supplier should be indifferent between the two contracts. However, the sequence and magnitude of costs and revenues (i.e., losses and gains) vary significantly between the contracts, suggesting the supplier\u2019s preference of contract type, and associated contract parameter values, may vary with the level of loss aversion. We investigate this phenomenon through two studies. The first is a preliminary study investigating whether human suppliers are indeed indifferent between these two contracts. Using a controlled laboratory experiment, with human subjects taking on the role of the supplier having to choose between contracts, we find that contract preferences change with the ratio of overage and underage costs for the channel (i.e., the newsvendor critical ratio). In particular, a buyback contract is preferred for products with low critical ratio, whereas revenue sharing is preferred for products with high critical ratio. We show these results are consistent with the behavioral tendency of loss aversion and are more significant for subjects who exhibit higher loss aversion tendencies in an out of context task. In the second (main) study, we examine differences in the performance of buyback and revenue-sharing contracts when suppliers have the authority to set contract parameters. We find that the contract frame influences the way parameters are set and the critical ratio again plays an important role. More specifically, revenue-sharing contracts are more profitable for the supplier than buyback contracts in a high critical ratio environment when accounting for the supplier\u2019s parameter-specification behavior. Also, there is little difference in performance between the two contracts in a low critical ratio environment.

Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks.

Incentive alignment is critical to motivate both information-acquisition and sales efforts. Two popular contract forms are investigated. One is the forecast-based contract (FC) that requires the seller to submit a demand forecast: the seller obtains commissions from the realized sales but is also obliged to pay a penalty for any deviation of the sales from the forecast. The other is the classical menu of linear contracts (MLC), from which the seller can choose a contract that specifies a unique commission rate and a fixed payment. The conventional understanding suggests that the MLC is superior, but it is often assumed that information is exogenously endowed. In contrast, we find that, with an endogenous information-acquisition effort, the MLC may suffer from a conflicted moral hazard effect that creates friction between motivations for the two efforts. The FC can, however, decouple these two tasks and thus dominate the MLC. We further find that when ensuring interim participation is necessary (e.g., renegotiation cannot be prevented after information acquisition), the performance of the FC might be affected by the adverse selection effect because it is unable to effectively separate different types, at which the MLC excels. We show that when the demand and supply mismatch cost is substantial, the conflicted moral hazard effect dominates the adverse selection effect, and the FC is more efficient, and it is the converse otherwise.

These design shortcuts and other maintenance activities contribute to the accumulation of <i>technical debt</i>, that is, a buildup of software maintenance obligations that need to be addressed in the future. We model and empirically analyze the impact of technical debt on system reliability by utilizing a longitudinal data set spanning the 10-year life cycle of a commercial enterprise system deployed at 48 different client firms. We use a <i>competing risks analysis</i> approach to discern the interdependency between client and vendor maintenance activities. This allows us to assess the effect of both problematic client modifications (client errors) and software errors present in the vendor-supplied platform (vendor errors) on system failures. We also examine the relative effects of <i>modular</i> and <i>architectural</i> maintenance activities undertaken by clients in order to analyze the dynamics of technical debt reduction. The results of our analysis first establish that technical debt decreases the reliability of enterprise systems. Second, modular maintenance targeted to reduce technical debt was approximately 53% more effective than architectural maintenance in reducing the probability of a system failure due to client errors, but it had the side effect of increasing the chance of a system failure due to vendor errors by approximately 83% more than did architectural maintenance activities. Using our empirical results we illustrate how firms could evaluate their business risk exposure due to technical debt accumulation in their enterprise systems, and we assess the estimated net effects, both positive and negative, of a range of software maintenance practices.

Three features of online social communication are represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status- or image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model, agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the entry of senders.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["marketing", "advertising and media", "social media", "social networks"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Competing for Attention in Social Communication Markets", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2209", "ex:pages": "2304-2320", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "giyer@haas.berkeley.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720", "ex:name": "Ganesh Iyer"}, {"ex:email": "zskatona@haas.berkeley.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720", "ex:name": "Zsolt Katona"}]}, {"ex:issue": "6", "ex:abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of capacity provisioning for an online service supported by advertising.

Our models assume that each worker has a category-specific quality, which is latent and not directly observable; what is observable, though, is the set of feedback ratings of the worker and of other contractors with similar work histories. Based on this information, we provide a series of models of increasing complexity that successfully estimate the worker\u2019s quality. We start by building a binomial model and a multinomial model under the implicit assumption that the latent qualities of the workers are static. Next, we remove this assumption, and we build linear dynamic systems that capture the evolution of these latent qualities over time.

We find evidence for the positive impact of scientific publications on a firm\u2019s market value beyond the effects of research and development, patent stocks, and patent quality, and also document heterogeneity with respect to this impact between different industrial sectors.<i>This paper was accepted by David Hsu, entrepreneurship and innovation</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["R&D strategy", "industrial science", "scientific disclosure", "knowledge disclosure", "open science", "Tobin\u2019s Q"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Corporate Science, Innovation, and Firm Value", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2220", "ex:pages": "1970-1981", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "msimeth@emp.uc3m.es", "ex:affiliation": "Department of Business Administration, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, 28903 Getafe, Spain; and Department of Managerial Economics, Strategy and Innovation, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium", "ex:name": "Markus Simeth"}, {"ex:email": "mcincera@ulb.ac.be", "ex:affiliation": "iCite, Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, 1050 Brussels, Belgium", "ex:name": "Michele Cincera"}]}, {"ex:issue": "7", "ex:abstract": "Resource assignment problems occur in a vast variety of applications, from scheduling problems over image recognition to communication networks. Often these problems can be modeled by a maximum weight matching problem in (bipartite) graphs or generalizations thereof, and efficient and practical algorithms are known for these problems. Although in some of the applications an assignment of the resources may be needed only once, in many of these applications, the assignment has to be computed more often for different scenarios. In that case it is often essential that the assignments can be computed very fast. Moreover, implementing different assignments in different scenarios may come with a certain cost for the reconfiguration of the system. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining optimal assignments sequentially over a given time horizon, where consecutive assignments are coupled by constraints that control the cost of reconfiguration. We develop fast approximation and online algorithms for this problem with provable approximation guarantees and competitive ratios. Moreover, we present an extensive computational study about the applicability of our model and our algorithms in the context of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks, finding a significant performance improvement for the total bandwidth of the system using our algorithms. For this application (the downlink of an OFDMA wireless cell) , the run time of matching algorithms is extremely important, having an acceptable range of a few milliseconds only. For the considered realistic instances, our algorithms perform extremely well: the solution quality is, on average, within a factor of 0.8\u20130.9 of optimal off-line solutions, and the running times are at most 5 ms per phase even in the worst case.

The heuristic involves a myopic pricing policy that generates each period\u2019s price as a function of the initial inventory level and a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment. In each period, the firm monitors its so-called price-deflated inventory position and places an order to reach a target base-stock level. The price-deflated inventory position weights the on-hand and pipeline inventory according to a factor that reflects the sensitivity of price to the net inventory level. To assess the effectiveness of our heuristic, we construct an upper bound to the exact system. The upper bound is based on an information-relaxation approach and involves a penalty function derived from the proposed heuristic. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is near-optimal. The heuristic approach can be applied to a wide variety of inventory systems, such as systems with fixed ordering costs or fixed batch sizes. The heuristic enables us to explore the use of price as a lever to balance supply and demand.

Bursts of volatility are often incorrectly identified as jumps when the sampling is too sparse. At a higher frequency, methods robust to microstructure noise are required. We argue that whatever the jump detection test and the sampling frequency, a large number of spurious detections remain because of multiple testing issues. We propose a formal treatment based on an explicit thresholding on available test statistics. We prove that our method eliminates asymptotically all remaining spurious detections. In Dow Jones stocks between 2006 and 2008, spurious detections can represent up to 90% of the jumps detected initially. For the stocks considered, jumps are rare events, they do not cluster in time, and no cojump affects all stocks simultaneously, suggesting jump risk is diversifiable. We relate the remaining jumps to macroeconomic news, prescheduled company-specific announcements, and stories from news agencies that include a variety of unscheduled and uncategorized events.

For instance, in September 2013, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into full effect. The accompanying transparency requirements have prompted physician practices and hospitals to severely restrict pharmaceutical sales representatives\u2019 direct access to their physicians. Despite all the attention in the popular press, scant scholarly research has investigated how these restrictions on physician access impact physician prescription behavior and competitive detailing to physicians. To analyze the impact of these restrictions, we develop a structural model of how pharmaceutical firms compete dynamically to schedule detailing to physicians. Detailing activities are known to have significant carryover effects that are captured in a first-stage model of physicians\u2019 demand for prescription drugs. We also specify detailing policy functions that describe each firm\u2019s observed detailing actions. In a second stage, we estimate a model that describes costs of detailing, assuming that the observed detailing levels are consistent with a Markov perfect Nash equilibrium. The estimated structural model is used to examine the implications of restrictions on the amount of detailing via counterfactual simulations. We find that restriction policies would increase the market share of a nondrug-treatment-only option but impact firms asymmetrically; firms that are strong in detailing and/or rely more on detailing would be hurt more. Unexpectedly, a policy that imposes a ceiling on detailing frequency could significantly reduce detailing of all firms in the market, including those firms with average detailing levels below the ceiling, and effectively would soften competition between firms and enhance their profits.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

Competitively priced bank loans are available, and the failure of loan repayment leads to bankruptcy, where default costs may include variable (proportional to the firm\u2019s sales) and fixed costs. Without default costs, it is known that simple contracts (e.g., revenue-sharing, buyback, and quantity discount) can coordinate and allocate profits arbitrarily in the chain. With only variable default costs, buyback contracts remain coordinating and equivalent to revenue-sharing contracts but are Pareto dominated by revenue-sharing contracts when fixed default costs are present. Thus, for general bankruptcy costs, contracts without buyback terms are of most interest. Quantity discount contracts fail to coordinate the supply chain, since a necessary condition for coordination is to proportionally reallocate debt obligations within the channel. With only variable default costs and with high fixed default costs exhibiting substantial economies-of-scale, revenue-sharing contracts with working capital coordination continue to coordinate the chain. Unexpectedly, for fixed default costs with small economies-of-scale effects, the two-firm system under a revenue-sharing contract with working capital coordination might have higher expected profit than the one-firm system.

However, in spite of the increasing prevalence of this information, there are relatively few academic studies that analyze the impact of peer ratings on consumers transacting in \u201creal-world\u201d marketplaces. In this paper, we partner with a major telecommunications company to analyze the impact of peer ratings in a real-world video-on-demand market where consumer participation is organic and where movies are costly and well known to consumers. After experimentally changing the initial conditions of product information displayed to consumers, we find that, consistent with the prior literature, peer ratings influence consumer behavior independently from underlying product quality. However, we also find that, in contrast to the prior literature, there is little evidence of long-term bias as a result of herding effects, at least in our setting. Specifically, when movies are artificially promoted or demoted in peer rating lists, subsequent reviews cause them to return to their true quality position relatively quickly. One explanation for this difference is that consumers in our empirical setting likely had more outside information about the true quality of the products they were evaluating than did consumers in the studies reported in prior literature. Although tentative, this explanation suggests that in real-world marketplaces where consumers have sufficient access to outside information about true product quality, peer ratings may be more robust to herding effects and thus provide more reliable signals of true product quality than previously thought.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin M.

We model a market comprised of an incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a signal about the consumer\u2019s demand, which may be high or low. We first confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since, regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level. However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as well as consumers. In addition, we show that compared to the advance purchase contract, all the firms except the incumbent manufacturer can be better off using public information sharing under a simple wholesale price contract.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["forecasting", "manufacturing", "strategy", "information sharing"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Public Forecast Information Sharing in a Market with Competing Supply Chains", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2261", "ex:pages": "2994-3022", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "nshamir@tau.ac.il", "ex:affiliation": "School of Management, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 699780, Israel", "ex:name": "Noam Shamir"}, {"ex:email": "hdshin@ucsd.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Rady School of Management, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093", "ex:name": "Hyoduk Shin"}]}, {"ex:issue": "9", "ex:abstract": "We investigate how adoption of a retailer\u2019s factory outlet channel impacts customers\u2019 spending in the retailer\u2019s traditional retail store channel.

However, the impact of adoption of this lower-quality, lower-price alternative channel on spending at the retailer\u2019s higher-quality, higher-price retail store channel is not clear. Customers adopting the outlet channel might increase their spending in the retail store channel because of the opportunity to become familiar with the brand at a lower price point or transfer of positive associations formed through patronage of the outlet channel to the store channel. Customers adopting the lower-quality channel might also decrease their spending in the retail store channel because of brand dilution or cannibalization. To investigate this issue, we use a unique individual-level panel data set from a specialty apparel retailer from a period during which the retailer opened many factory outlet stores. This allows us to study how purchase behavior changes after customers adopt the outlet channel while carefully controlling for alternative explanations including customer heterogeneity and selection effects. We find that although customers who adopt the outlet channel spend less with the retailer compared to store-only customers, the difference cannot be attributed to the impact of adoption of the outlet channel. After controlling for heterogeneity and selection effects, we uncover a positive spillover to the retail store channel from adoption of the outlet channel. Customers who adopt the outlet channel not only make incremental purchases at the outlet channel, but also increase their spending in the retail store channel after adoption. The increase in spending is due to more frequent retail store purchases and not to larger per-purchase expenditure.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

We discuss implications for policy, managerial intervention, and allocation of resources in the ongoing accumulation of scientific knowledge.<i>This paper was accepted by Lee Fleming, entrepreneurship and innovation</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["innovation", "project selection", "bounded rationality", "knowledge frontier", "novelty", "intellectual distance"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Looking Across and Looking Beyond the Knowledge Frontier: Intellectual Distance, Novelty, and Resource Allocation in Science", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2285", "ex:pages": "2765-2783", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "kboudreau@hbs.edu", "ex:affiliation": "London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom; and Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163", "ex:name": "Kevin J.

We posit that managers know before analysts when extremely good earnings news is developing, but can have incentives to allow the earnings news to surprise the market at the earnings announcement. In particular, managers can use an extreme positive earnings surprise to attract investor attention when they believe their stock is neglected and future performance is expected to be strong. Analysts, who must allocate scarce resources across many firms, can also be inattentive and miss signals that suggest good performance is going to be announced. Using various proxies for extreme positive earnings surprises, management expectations for future performance and desire for attention, and analyst neglect, we find evidence that an extreme positive earnings surprise is a predictable event. These findings are incremental to controlling for a firm\u2019s information environment, earnings volatility, and operating leverage. Finally, we show that extreme positive earnings surprises are a successful method for attracting attention, with significant increases in the number of institutional owners, the number of analysts, and trading volume during the subsequent three years.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting.</i>", "ex:keywords": ["accounting", "economics", "behavior", "behavioral decision making", "financial institutions", "markets"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Attracting Attention in a Limited Attention World: Exploring the Causes and Consequences of Extreme Positive Earnings Surprises", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2286", "ex:pages": "2871-2896", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "allison.koester@georgetown.edu", "ex:affiliation": "McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057", "ex:name": "Allison Koester"}, {"ex:email": "russell.lundholm@sauder.ubc.ca", "ex:affiliation": "Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z2, Canada", "ex:name": "Russell Lundholm"}, {"ex:email": "msoliman@marshall.usc.edu", "ex:affiliation": "Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089", "ex:name": "Mark Soliman"}]}, {"ex:issue": "10", "ex:abstract": "Sellers are often more interested in inducing buyers to make a choice\u2014any choice\u2014than in influencing which option they choose.

This empirical finding is usually invoked to suggest that preferences are constructive and susceptible to decision environment. Yet preference construction can be systematic and endogenous. This paper develops the theory of contextual deliberation as a potential explanation for behavioral phenomena of preference construction. When preference ordering in a choice set is ex ante unknown and state dependent, decision makers can engage in information acquisition activities (i.e., deliberation) before choice to improve knowledge about the state-dependent preference ordering. Choice context can thus influence ex post preference ordering through affecting the incentive to deliberate. Consequently, contextual deliberation may lead to preference construction and give rise to seemingly irrational behavioral phenomena such as the compromise effect and the choice overload effect. The theory of contextual deliberation also yields predictions that can be empirically tested to identify from other alternative explanations.<i>This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing</i>.", "ex:keywords": ["choice overload", "compromise effect", "context-dependent preference", "context effect", "deliberation", "preference construction"], "ex:source": "Management Science", "ex:title": "Contextual Deliberation and Preference Construction", "ex:url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2290", "ex:pages": "2977-2993", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "62", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "2016", "ex:creator": [{"ex:email": "liangguo@baf.cuhk.edu.hk", "ex:affiliation": "CUHK Business School, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong", "ex:name": "Liang Guo"}]}]
