Using optimal control techniques, we show that in the optimal hierarchy the wage scales and effort levels decrease as one moves down the hierarchy. As the hierarchy expands with no technological progress, workers exert less effort and are paid less, top managers work harder and are paid more and the wage distribution becomes increasingly skewed.", "ex:keywords": [], "ex:source": "Review of Economic Studies", "ex:title": "Incentives and Loss of Control in an Optimal Hierarchy", "ex:url": "http://hdl.handle.net/10.2307/2297902", "ex:pages": "527-544", "@context": {"dc": "http://schema.org/"}, "ex:volume": "61", "ex:template": "Template-Type: ReDIF-Article 1.0", "ex:date": "1994", "ex:creator": [{"ex:name": "Yingyi Qian"}]}, {"ex:issue": "3", "ex:abstract": "An experiment was conducted to test whether discounted repeated play leads to greater cooperation and coordination than one-shot play in a public good environment with incomplete information.

The design varied a number of environmental parameters, including the size of the group, and the statistical distribution of marginal rates of substitution between the public and private good. Marginal rates of substitution were private information but the statistical distribution was common knowledge.
