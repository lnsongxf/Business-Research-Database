Title: Does Capital Structure Affect the Behavior of Nonfinancial Stakeholders? An Empirical Investigation into Leverage and Union Strikes
Abstract: We use contract negotiation data to study how leverage affects the interaction between firms and an important nonfinancial stakeholder, labor unions. Consistent with the idea that leverage diminishes the bargaining position of labor, we find that unions are less likely to strike when a firm has high leverage or increases leverage prior to a contract negotiation. We also find large leverage increases after a strike, consistent with the idea that firms intentionally use leverage to improve their bargaining position. This poststrike increase in leverage is particularly pronounced when the union wins the strike. Moreover, we do not find any clear indication that such increases in leverage are linked to changes in investments. In addition, firms that experience a strike subsequently invest more internationally and in right-to-work states where union are afforded fewer legal protections, and they increase their disposal of production units that are located in states where strikes have occurred.<i>This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, finance</i>.

Title: Speculative Investors and Transactions Tax: Evidence from the Housing Market
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of a policy change in transaction tax on speculators. The policy intervention took place in Singapore’s housing market; it effectively raised the transaction cost in a segment favored by short-term speculators. Relative to the unaffected control sample, we find that the rise in transaction cost, equivalent to a two- to three-percentage-point increase in transaction tax, reduced speculative trading in the treatment segment by 75% and raised its price volatility by 18%. It also significantly reduced price informativeness. We further show that the results are likely due to a relatively greater withdrawal by informed speculators than by destabilizing speculators following the transaction cost increase.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance.</i>

Title: Why Do Borrowers Make Mortgage Refinancing Mistakes?
Abstract: Refinancing a mortgage is often one of the most important financial decisions people make. Borrowers choose the interest rate differential at which to refinance, and when that differential is reached, they need to take the steps to refinance before rates change again. Using a simple closed-form solution approximation of the optimal refinancing rule and a unique panel data set including information from a large secondary market participant on refinancing, we find that approximately 57% of borrowers refinance suboptimally—50% choose the wrong rate, 17% wait too long to refinance, and 10% do both. Financially sophisticated borrowers make smaller mistakes, refinancing at rates closer to optimal and waiting less after mortgage rates reach their trigger rates. Evidence suggests borrowers learn from their refinancing experiences.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance</i>.

Title: Make-Take Structure and Market Quality: Evidence from the U.S. Options Markets
Abstract: We examine the make-take structure, which compensates liquidity suppliers and charges liquidity demanders, in the options markets where it competes with a traditional structure that uses payments for order flow. Using the introduction of the make-take structure as an event, we find that execution costs (including fees) for liquidity demanders decline after the event for the affected options, that the make-take structure encourages market makers to improve quoted prices, and that brokers change their routing behavior to include fees in the routing decision. The decline in execution costs is consistent with the benefits of the increased quote competition from the make-take structure prevailing over the fees the structure charges to liquidity demanders.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance</i>.

Title: On the Nonexclusivity of Loan Contracts: An Empirical Investigation
Abstract: We study how a bank’s willingness to lend to a previously exclusive firm changes once the firm obtains a loan from another bank (“outside loan”) and breaks an exclusive relationship. Using a difference-in-difference analysis and a setting where outside loans are observable, we document that an outside loan triggers a decrease in the initial bank’s willingness to lend to the firm, i.e., outside loans are strategic substitutes. Consistent with concerns about coordination problems and higher indebtedness, we find that this reaction is more pronounced the larger the outside loan and it is muted if the initial bank’s existing and future loans retain seniority and are protected with valuable collateral. Our results give a benevolent role to transparency enabling banks to mitigate adverse effects from outside loans. The resulting substitute behavior may also act as a stabilizing force in credit markets limiting positive comovements between lenders, decreasing the possibility of credit freezes and financial crises.<i>This paper was accepted by Itay Goldstein, finance</i>.

Title: The Determinants and Impact of Executive-Firm Matches
Abstract: I estimate a model of executive-firm matching, in which both components of the executive labor market outcome—the assignment of managers to firms and the cross-sectional distribution of executive pay—are endogenously determined. Results in this paper reveal the importance of match specificity in productivity, driven by complementarities between firm and manager attributes. Therefore, one reason that larger, more diversified, research-intensive firms pay their executives more is because they are assortatively matched with managers that are talented, have more cross-industry experience, and are prone to innovation. More important, they outbid competing firms for these managers because they enjoy higher marginal productivity from given managerial skills. Announcement abnormal returns and executive tenure duration are both higher for matches with higher estimated productivity, suggesting mutual benefits for both the firms and the managers from assortative matching.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance</i>.

Title: Consumer Social Responsibility
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of socially responsible (SR) production through consumer decisions. Our experimental treatments vary market competitiveness and consumers’ information on social responsibility in production. We show that—irrespective of consumers’ information—SR production reduces monopolistic supplier’s profit and is therefore unlikely to emerge. With supplier competition, SR production positively influences consumers’ buying decisions and suppliers offering SR products achieve significantly higher profits, as long as their price is not too high. Our results yield valuable insights into the possibilities and limitations of promoting SR production through consumer behavior, and they provide evidence for positive effects of competition on moral behavior.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2279">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2279</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program: An Economic and Operational Analysis
Abstract: The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), a part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to penalize hospitals with excess readmissions. We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP’s benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in <i>any</i> equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4%–13% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy’s outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process—comparing hospitals against similar peers—improves the performance of the policy.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.

Title: Reading the Fine Print: Information Disclosure in the Brazilian Credit Card Market
Abstract: Consumer credit regulations usually require that lenders disclose interest rates. However, in the absence of specific prominence requirements, lenders can conceal the interest rate in the fine print while still complying with the law. I examine the effect of such a strategy using a field experiment in Brazil in which a credit card company offered their clients payment plans to pay off their balances. Using randomized contract interest rates and the degree of rate disclosure, I show that most clients are rate sensitive, whether or not rates are prominently disclosed. The elasticity of payment plan enrollment with respect to the interest rate ranges from −0.711 to −0.880. High-risk clients are an exception; these clients are rate sensitive only when disclosure is prominent. I also show that clients are influenced by nudges that favor longer-term contracts. Conditional on enrollment, the proportion of clients who choose a longer-term contract is 40 percentage points higher when a longer-term contract is featured in the advertisement layout. This effect, however, is weaker when stakes are higher.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2281">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2281</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance.</i>

Title: A Characterization of the SSD-Efficient Frontier of Portfolio Weights by Means of a Set of Mixed-Integer Linear Constraints
Abstract: In this paper, the set of all second-order stochastic dominance (SSD)-efficient portfolios is characterized by using a series of mixed-integer linear constraints. Our derivation employs a combination of the first-order conditions of the utility maximization problem together with a judicious use of binary variables. This result opens the door to the formulation of optimizations whose objective function is free to select a particular portfolio out of the entire SSD-efficient set.<i>This paper was accepted by Jerome Detemple, finance</i>.

Title: Do Brokers of Insiders Tip Other Clients?
Abstract: We examine trading activity around insider transactions on the Toronto Stock Exchange and find evidence that some traders mimic insider positions. Our unique data set allows us to establish a direct connection between insiders, their brokerages, and the brokerages’ other clients. The findings are consistent with the possibility that some brokerages tip their clients about insider trades. Insiders in our sample have good timing; returns are usually positive (negative) after insider purchases (sales). Insiders’ good timing translates to the mimicking transactions, which appear to be profitable net of trading costs. Evidence consistent with tipping is observed mainly for smaller independent brokerages.<i>This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, finance</i>.

Title: Employee Recognition and Performance: A Field Experiment
Abstract: This paper reports the results from a controlled field experiment designed to investigate the causal effect of unannounced, public recognition on employee performance. We hired more than 300 employees to work on a three-hour data-entry task. In a random sample of work groups, workers unexpectedly received recognition after two hours of work. We find that recognition increases subsequent performance substantially, and particularly when recognition is exclusively provided to the best performers. Remarkably, workers who did not receive recognition are mainly responsible for this performance increase. Our results are consistent with workers having a preference for conformity and being reciprocal at the same time.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2291">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2291</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Fire Sales and House Prices: Evidence from Estate Sales Due to Sudden Death
Abstract: This study investigates when forced sales of real estate turn into fire sales by using a natural experiment that allows us to separate supply and demand effects: Forced sales result from sudden death of house owners and are thus unrelated to current market conditions. We find that forced sales result in fire sale discounts. Discounts increase when the sale is urgent, market conditions are poor, and the seller is financially constrained. Overall, our study identifies when forced sales lead to fire sale discounts, and highlights that fire sales occur even in the absence of temporary demand shocks.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance</i>.

Title: Old Age and the Decline in Financial Literacy
Abstract: Households age 60 and older bear increasing responsibility for managing retirement portfolios, and they hold the majority of financial assets in the United States. Cognitive aging studies find evidence of a decline in fluid and crystallized intelligence in old age that may impact the ability to manage money effectively. Using a large sample of older respondents, we test whether knowledge of basic concepts essential to effective financial choice declines after age 60. We find a consistent linear decline in financial literacy score after age 60. A nearly identical rate of decline among men, stockowners, older, and college-educated respondents indicates that cohort effects are not driving the results. Confidence in financial decision-making abilities does not decline with age. A separate analysis using data that include measures of cognitive ability suggests that a natural decline in both fluid and crystallized intelligence in old age contributes to falling financial literacy scores.<i>This paper was accepted by Brad Barber, finance.</i>

Title: A Reconsideration of Gender Differences in Risk Attitudes
Abstract: This paper reconsiders the wide agreement that females are more risk averse than males. We survey the existing experimental literature, finding that significance and magnitude of gender differences are task specific. We gather data from 54 replications of the Holt and Laury risk elicitation method, involving about 7,000 subjects. Gender differences appear in less than 10% of the studies and are significant but negligible in magnitude once all the data are pooled. Results are confirmed by structural estimations, which also support a constant relative risk aversion representation of preferences. Gender differences correlate with the presence of a safe option and fixed probabilities in the elicitation method.<i>This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: When Does Competition Foster Commitment?
Abstract: Consider a firm that would like to commit to a focused business strategy because focus improves efficiency and thus increases profit. We identify two general conditions under which tougher competition strengthens the firm’s ability to commit to a focused strategy. Under these conditions, competition fosters commitment for two reasons: (i) competition reduces the value of the option to diversify (<i>the contestability effect</i>), and (ii) competition increases the importance of being efficient (<i>the efficiency effect</i>). We use a number of different models of imperfect competition to illustrate the applicability of our results. Our examples suggest that the contestability effect is very general. In contrast, the efficiency effect often requires further conditions, which are specific to the nature of competition in each model. In both cases, our analysis helps us predict when these effects are more likely to be observed.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy</i>.

Title: Getting to the Top of Mind: How Reminders Increase Saving
Abstract: We provide evidence from field experiments with three different banks that reminder messages increase commitment attainment for clients who recently opened commitment savings accounts. Messages that mention both savings goals and financial incentives are particularly effective, whereas other content variations such as gain versus loss framing do not have significantly different effects. Nor do we find evidence that receiving additional late reminders has an additive effect. These empirical results do not map neatly into existing models, so we provide a simple model where limited attention to exceptional expenses can generate undersaving that is in turn mitigated by reminders.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2296">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2296</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Teck-Hua Ho, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Competing Under Asymmetric Information: The Case of Dynamic Random Access Memory Manufacturing
Abstract: Much like in other semiconductor environments, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturers face significant demand uncertainty before production and capacity decisions can be implemented. This paper investigates the role of market information in DRAM manufacturing and the consequences of allowing information sharing in the industry. An oligopoly model of competition with correlated private information is developed in which firms make decisions about production and capacity. In this setting, firms consider the information their competitors are likely to hold, conditional on their own. We find that both firms and customers benefit when firms share information with their competitors. In particular, sharing information is profitable because market price decreases slowly with overproduction. When combined with the results from the information sharing literature, this paper highlights the need to assess information sharing policies on a case-by-case basis.<i>This paper was accepted by Matthew Shum, marketing</i>.

Title: Leveraging Experienced Consumers to Attract New Consumers: An Equilibrium Analysis of Displaying Deal Sales by Daily Deal Websites
Abstract: Daily deal websites help small local merchants to attract new consumers. A strategy adopted by some websites is to continually track and display the number of deals sold by a merchant. We investigate the strategic implications of displaying deal sales and the website’s incentive to implement this feature. We analyze a market in which a merchant offering an experience good is privately informed of its type. Whereas daily deals cannibalize a merchant’s revenue from experienced consumers, we show that, by displaying deal sales, the website can transform this cannibalization into an advantage. Displaying deal sales can leverage discounted sales to experienced consumers to help a high-quality merchant signal its type and acquire new consumers at a higher margin. Signaling is supported through observational learning from displayed deal sales since it reveals how experienced consumers respond to the deal. Nevertheless, the website may not implement this feature if signaling entails too much distortion in the merchant’s deal price. We also find that it can be optimal for the website to offer the merchant an up-front subsidy, but only if the website displays deal sales. Our analysis leads to managerial insights for daily deal websites.<i>This paper was accepted by J. Miguel Villas-Boas, marketing</i>.

Title: The Effect of Board Directors from Countries with Different Genetic Diversity Levels on Corporate Performance
Abstract: We link genetic diversity in the country of origin of the firms’ board members with corporate performance via board members’ nationality. We hypothesize that our approach captures deep-rooted differences in cultural, institutional, social, psychological, physiological, and other traits that cannot be captured by other recently measured indices of diversity. Using a panel of firms listed in the North American and UK stock markets, we find that adding board directors from countries with different levels of genetic diversity (either higher or lower) increases firm performance. This effect prevails when we control for a number of cultural, institutional, firm-level, and board member characteristics, as well as for the nationality of the board of directors. To identify the relationship, we use—as instrumental variables for our diversity indices—the migratory distance from East Africa and the level of ultraviolet exposure in the directors’ country of nationality.<i>This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance</i>.

Title: Deadlines in Product Development
Abstract: Deadlines are common in product development and are often felt to be too harsh—many development efforts are still worth continuing at the time of mandated termination. We examine the value of deadlines from the agency-theoretic perspective. We consider a firm that pays an agent to lead product development activities. The chance of success depends on the viability of the project and the effort of the agent. As the project proceeds without success, doubts grow as to whether the project is viable. To motivate continued effort, the firm must promise the agent a generous reward if success is achieved during the late stage of development. However, rewarding late success undermines effort incentives in the early stage. The firm may find it more profitable to impose a hard, early deadline to eliminate the agent’s dynamic incentive to procrastinate. We derive conditions under which the firm should impose such deadlines.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing</i>.

Title: One-Way Mirrors in Online Dating: A Randomized Field Experiment
Abstract: The growing popularity of online dating websites is altering one of the most fundamental human activities: finding a date or a marriage partner. Online dating platforms offer new capabilities, such as extensive search, big data–based mate recommendations, and varying levels of anonymity, whose parallels do not exist in the physical world. Yet little is known about the causal effects of these new features. In this study we examine the impact of a particular anonymity feature, which is unique to online environments, on matching outcomes. This feature allows users to browse profiles of other users anonymously, by being able to check out a potential mate’s profile while not leaving any visible online record of the visit. Although this feature may decrease search costs and allow users to search without inhibition, it also eliminates “weak signals” of interest for their potential mates that may play an important role in establishing successful communication. We run a randomized field experiment on a major North American online dating website, where 50,000 of 100,000 randomly selected new users are gifted the ability to anonymously view profiles of other users. Compared with the control group, the users treated with anonymity become disinhibited, in that they view more profiles and are more likely to view same-sex and interracial mates. However, based on our analysis, we demonstrate causally that weak signaling is a key mechanism in achieving higher levels of matching outcomes. Anonymous users, who lose the ability to leave a weak signal, end up having fewer matches compared with their nonanonymous counterparts. This effect of anonymity is particularly strong for women, who tend not to make the first move and instead rely on the counterparty to initiate the communication. Further, the reduction in quantity of matches by anonymous users is not compensated by a corresponding increase in quality of matches.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems</i>.

Title: Robust Scheduling Practices in the U.S. Airline Industry: Costs, Returns, and Inefficiencies
Abstract: Airlines use robust scheduling to mitigate the impact of unforeseeable disruptions on profits. We examine how effectively three common practices—flexibility to swap aircraft, flexibility to reassign gates, and scheduled aircraft downtime—accomplish this goal. We first estimate a multiple-input, multiple-outcome production frontier, which defines the attainable set of outcomes from given inputs. We then recover unobserved input costs and calculate how expenditure on inputs affects outcomes and revenues. We find that the per-dollar return from expenditure on gates, or more effective management of existing gate capacity, is three times larger than the per-dollar returns from other inputs. Next, we use the estimated trade-offs faced by carriers along the frontier to measure the value to carriers of reducing delays. Finally, we calculate the improvement in carriers’ outcomes and profits if their operational inefficiencies are eliminated. On average, we estimate that operational inefficiencies cost carriers about $1.7 billion in revenue annually. <i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.

Title: The Role of Brand Image and Product Characteristics on Firms’ Entry and OEM Decisions
Abstract: We investigate the optimal market entry and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) decisions of a firm facing a market in which firms’ brands can be horizontally differentiated and products can be vertically differentiated. The entrant might sell under its own brand and compete with an incumbent, become a supplier to the incumbent, or both. Findings reveal that when consumers perceive the firms are horizontally and vertically differentiated, the entrant profits by simultaneously entering the market and establishing an OEM arrangement with the incumbent. In such competitive scenarios, both buyer and seller increase profits by agreeing on wholesale prices that are not too low, which softens both horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms. Findings also show that the incumbent may prefer to pay high wholesale prices to the entrant even if the incumbent had the option to source the product independently at a lower marginal cost. When firms have the capability of producing each other’s product lines, supply relationships between them can still happen in equilibrium. In this case, an interesting result is that firms may optimally select to differentiate production and, because of the OEM relationship, sell the same product qualities to consumers. The reason for this outcome is that the OEM arrangement with differentiated production causes a strategic effect that reduces the firms’ aggressiveness when competing for consumers. Under certain conditions, the OEM arrangement can completely nullify the horizontal and vertical conflict between the firms.<i>This paper was accepted by J. Miguel Villas-Boas, marketing</i>.

Title: Fake It Till You Make It: Reputation, Competition, and Yelp Review Fraud
Abstract: Consumer reviews are now part of everyday decision making. Yet the credibility of these reviews is fundamentally undermined when businesses commit review fraud, creating fake reviews for themselves or their competitors. We investigate the economic incentives to commit review fraud on the popular review platform Yelp, using two complementary approaches and data sets. We begin by analyzing restaurant reviews that are identified by Yelp’s filtering algorithm as suspicious, or fake—and treat these as a proxy for review fraud (an assumption we provide evidence for). We present four main findings. First, roughly 16% of restaurant reviews on Yelp are filtered. These reviews tend to be more extreme (favorable or unfavorable) than other reviews, and the prevalence of suspicious reviews has grown significantly over time. Second, a restaurant is more likely to commit review fraud when its reputation is weak, i.e., when it has few reviews or it has recently received bad reviews. Third, chain restaurants—which benefit less from Yelp—are also less likely to commit review fraud. Fourth, when restaurants face increased competition, they become more likely to receive unfavorable fake reviews. Using a separate data set, we analyze businesses that were caught soliciting fake reviews through a sting conducted by Yelp. These data support our main results and shed further light on the economic incentives behind a business’s decision to leave fake reviews.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems</i>.

Title: Quantitative Easing and Volatility Spillovers Across Countries and Asset Classes
Abstract: We identify networks of volatility spillovers and examine time-varying spillover intensities with daily implied volatilities of U.S. Treasury bonds, global stock indices, and commodities. The U.S. stock market is the center of the international volatility spillover network, and its volatility spillover to other markets has intensified since 2008. Moreover, U.S. quantitative easing alone explains 40%–55% of intensifying spillover from the United States. The addition of interest rate and currency factors does not diminish the dominant role of quantitative easing. Our findings highlight the primary contribution of U.S. unconventional monetary policy to volatility spillovers and potential global systemic risk.<i>This paper was accepted by Neng Wang, finance</i>.

Title: Large Market Declines and Securities Litigation: Implications for Disclosing Adverse Earnings News
Abstract: This study finds that large marketwide declines in stock prices are associated with higher litigation incidence and settlements even though marketwide events are legally irrelevant. The probability of litigation nearly doubles (from 0.29% to 0.55%) and the amount of settlements also doubles (from $5.0 million to $10.1 million) when earnings disclosures occur during a large market decline, even after controlling for the firm’s market-adjusted return. Furthermore, judges with (without) specialized experience in securities litigation are more (less) likely to dismiss cases triggered by disclosures during large market declines. This pattern is consistent with experienced judges recognizing and dismissing weaker cases. Finally, managers are less likely to disclose adverse news at the end of trading days with large market declines. Although we cannot definitively identify the motive behind this pattern, it is consistent with managers recognizing increased litigation risk during large market declines.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting</i>.

Title: Corporate Postretirement Benefit Plans and Real Investment
Abstract: This paper shows that the real investment by nonfinancial firms is systematically related to the size of their defined-benefit plan. In particular, these plans allow research and development (R&D)-intensive firms to retain and borrow from their employees, which is attractive since they have high adjustment costs, require a stable cash flow, have less collateral, have assets that are harder to value, and have high asymmetric information and agency costs. By contrast, capital expenditures benefit from credit multiplier effects with regard to regular debt, which substitutes for postretirement obligations. As a result, firms with defined-benefit plans have 12% more R&D and 5% less capital expenditure compared with otherwise similar firms, and they vary contributions as a function of cash flow and real investment. The role of postretirement plans is attenuated in countries with available alternative funding sources. The results are robust to controlling for other dimensions of financial policy—cash holdings, debt maturity, dividends, preferred stock, convertible debt, and leverage—that also affect real investment.<i>This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance</i>.

Title: Spatial Organization of Firms and Location Choices Through the Value Chain
Abstract: We explore the impact of geographically bounded, intrafirm linkages (internal agglomerations) and geographically bounded, interfirm linkages (external agglomerations) on firms’ location strategies. Using data from the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Business Database, we analyze the locations of new establishments of biopharmaceutical firms in the United States from 1993 to 2005. We consider all activities in the value chain and allow location choices to vary by research and development, manufacturing, and sales. Our findings suggest that internal agglomerations have a positive impact on location. The effects of internal agglomerations vary by activity, and they arise both within an activity (e.g., among plants) and across activities (e.g., between sales and manufacturing). Our results also suggest that previous estimates of the effect of external agglomerations may be overestimated because the existing literature abstracted from internal agglomerations.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy</i>.

Title: Economic and Policy Implications of Restricted Patch Distribution
Abstract: In this paper, we study how restricting the availability of patches to legal users impacts the vendor’s profits, market share, software maintenance decisions, and welfare outcomes. Prior work on this topic assumes that the hacker’s effort is independent of the vendor’s decision to release the patch freely or not. Clearly, if the patch is not available to everyone, the hacker finds it easier to exploit the vulnerability in the product and, as a result, is likely to alter his effort. To understand the role of a strategic hacker, we build a game-theoretic model, where the hacker’s decision is endogenous. With this model, we find that the hacker’s effort may, on the one hand, decrease the utility that the vendor can extract from the consumers but, on the other hand, may help differentiate the legal version of the product from the pirated version. A vendor can strategically exploit the hacker’s behavior in its pricing and software maintenance decisions. The endogeneity of the hacker’s actions drives several of our findings that have interesting policy implications. For example, the vendor may increase the price and reduce market share to exploit the differentiation. In such a case, there may be more pirates in the restricted-patch case than when the patch is freely available, a result that runs counter to typical arguments provided for restricting patches.<i>This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems</i>.

Title: Optimizing the Deployment of Public Access Defibrillators
Abstract: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a significant public health issue, and treatment, namely, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, is very time sensitive. Public access defibrillation programs, which deploy automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for bystander use in an emergency, reduce the time to defibrillation and improve survival rates. In this paper, we develop models to guide the deployment of public AEDs. Our models generalize existing location models and incorporate differences in bystander behavior. We formulate three mixed integer nonlinear models and derive equivalent integer linear reformulations or easily computable bounds. We use kernel density estimation to derive a spatial probability distribution of cardiac arrests that is used for optimization and model evaluation. Using data from Toronto, Canada, we show that optimizing AED deployment outperforms the existing approach by 40% in coverage, and substantial gains can be achieved through relocating existing AEDs. Our results suggest that improvements in survival and cost-effectiveness are possible with optimization.<i>This paper was accepted by Dimitris Bertsimas, optimization</i>.

Title: Cheating and Loss Aversion: Do People Cheat More to Avoid a Loss?
Abstract: Does the extent of cheating depend on a proper reference point? We use a real-effort matrix task that implements a two (gain versus loss frame) times two (monitored performance versus unmonitored performance) between-subjects design with 600 experimental participants to examine whether the extent of cheating is reference dependent. Self-reported performance in the unmonitored condition is significantly higher than actual performance in the monitored condition—a clear indication of cheating. However, the level of cheating is by far higher in the loss frame than in the gain frame under no monitoring. The fear of a loss seems to lead to more dishonest behavior than the lure of a gain.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2313">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2313</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Bending the Pipeline? Executive Search and Gender Inequality in Hiring for Top Management Jobs
Abstract: We study the sources of women’s underrepresentation in hiring for top management jobs by focusing on the context of executive search. Using data that include proprietary information on 10,970 individuals considered by a search firm, we examine the sources of the low proportion of women placed in senior roles. Contrary to received wisdom, we find limited evidence that demand-side screeners strongly contribute to gender disadvantage in this setting. What gender differences exist tend to play out at the start of the hiring process and are driven both by supply-side and demand-side actors. Once considered for a position, women are no less likely than men to be hired—though they are slightly less likely to be interviewed by the search firm. Our findings highlight the theoretical importance of disentangling candidates’ “self-steering” behavior from the “pipeline bending” of hiring agents. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding gender inequality at upper echelons of the labor market.<i>This paper was accepted by Olav Sorenson, organizations</i>.

Title: Search for Information on Multiple Products
Abstract: We develop a framework for continuous search for information on a choice set of multiple alternatives and apply it to consumer search in a product market. When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase. Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering complete information on all the products and need to make decisions under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in the consumer’s consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for information and purchases a product if the difference between the expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision. We also find that it is optimal for a monopolistic seller of multiple products to facilitate information search for low-valuation consumers and obfuscate information for those with high valuations.<i>This paper was accepted by Eric Anderson, marketing</i>.

Title: Risk Aversion and Wealth: Evidence from Person-to-Person Lending Portfolios
Abstract: We estimate risk aversion from investors’ financial decisions in a person-to-person lending platform. We develop a method that obtains a risk-aversion parameter from each portfolio choice. Since the same individuals invest repeatedly, we construct a panel data set that we use to disentangle heterogeneity in attitudes toward risk across investors, from the elasticity of risk aversion to changes in wealth. We find that wealthier investors are more risk averse in the cross section and that investors become more risk averse after a negative housing wealth shock. Thus, investors exhibit preferences consistent with decreasing relative risk aversion and habit formation.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2317">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2317</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Amit Seru, finance</i>.

Title: Testing the Transparency Implications of Mandatory IFRS Adoption: The Spread/Maturity Relation of Credit Default Swaps
Abstract: This study tests whether international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adoption increased accounting transparency based on model-driven hypotheses. Duffie and Lando [Duffie D, Lando D (2001) Term structures of credit spreads with incomplete accounting information. <i>Econometrica</i> 69(3):633–644] show that changes to accounting transparency affect the spread/maturity relation of credit default swap (CDS) instruments in very specific ways. Consistent with their model, we find that CDS spreads are lower across maturities following the adoption of IFRS, and the slope and concavity of the CDS spread/maturity relation are higher. These changes did not occur to the spread/maturity relation of a control sample of CDS instruments. Predicted changes apply more intensely to firms with low pre-IFRS transparency. Overall, this study provides strong evidence that IFRS adoption increased accounting transparency.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting</i>.

Title: Blind Queues: The Impact of Consumer Beliefs on Revenues and Congestion
Abstract: In many service settings, customers have to join the queue without being fully aware of the parameters of the service provider (e.g., customers at checkout counters may not know the true service rate before joining). In such “blind queues,” customers make their joining/balking decisions based on limited information about the service provider’s operational parameters (from past service experiences, reviews, etc.) and queue lengths. We analyze a firm serving customers making decisions under arbitrary beliefs about the service parameters in an observable queue for a service with a known price. By proposing an ordering for the balking threshold distributions in the customer population, we are able to compare the effects of customer beliefs on the queue. We show that, although revealing the service information to customers improves revenues under certain conditions, it may destroy consumer welfare or social welfare. Given a market size, consumer welfare can be significantly reduced when a fast server announces its true service parameter. When revenue is higher under some beliefs, one would expect the congestion to also be higher because more customers join, but we show that congestion may not necessarily increase.<i>This paper was accepted by Teck-Hua Ho, stochastic models and simulation</i>.

Title: The Impact of Losing in a Competition on the Willingness to Seek Further Challenges
Abstract: How do people react to setbacks and successes? I use a laboratory experiment to determine the effect of winning and losing in a competition on the willingness to seek further challenges. Participants compete in two-person tournaments in an arithmetic task and are then informed of their score and the outcome of the competition. Participants then have to decide on a performance target for a second round: the higher the target, the higher the potential reward, but participants who do not reach the target earn nothing. Conditional on the score, winning or losing is exogenous. I find that, conditional on first-round scores, losers go for a more challenging target. Losers also perform worse, leading to lower earnings and a higher probability of failure. These results are driven by gender-specific reactions to winning and losing: men react to losing by picking a more challenging target while women lower their performance. These findings could have important implications for our understanding of individual career paths. Early outcomes could alter the probability of success and failure in the long term.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2321">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2321</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Gain Without Pain: The Extended Effects of a Behavioral Health Intervention
Abstract: We examine the extended effects of an incentive-based behavioral health intervention designed to improve nutrition behavior. Although the intervention successfully improved the target behavior, less is known about any spillovers, positive or negative, that impacted the program’s net benefit. This novel examination presents an opportunity to advance our knowledge of this important question, particularly because many theories predict that balancing behaviors in other domains (e.g., reduced exercise) can occur. Our results show a positive and long-lasting persistence effect for the treatment group, even after the incentive was removed. Moreover, we observe no negative spillover effects into related domains such as exercise, and no negative impact on customer loyalty. These results support the use of incentive-based interventions and highlight the importance, for both theory and practice, of examining their extended effects.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Reputation and Regulations: Evidence from eBay
Abstract: To mitigate inefficiencies arising from asymmetric information, some markets rely on government interventions, whereas others rely on reputation systems, warranties, or guarantees. This paper explores the impact of two mechanisms, namely, reputation badges and buyer protection programs, and their interaction on eBay’s marketplace. Adding buyer protection reduces the premium for the reputation badge and increases efficiency in the marketplace. These efficiency gains are achieved by reducing moral hazard through an increase in sellers´ quality and by reducing adverse selection through a higher exit rate for low-quality sellers. Our estimates suggest buyer protection increases the total welfare by 2.9%.<i>This paper was accepted by Matt Shum, marketing</i>.

Title: Spillovers from Wiring Schools with Broadband: The Critical Role of Children
Abstract: Providing broadband to schools can be an effective way to foster household Internet adoption in neighboring areas. On the one hand, the infrastructure put into place to meet schools’ needs can also serve households. On the other hand, students get acquainted with the Internet at school and signal its usefulness to adults at home who, consequently, can be more likely to adopt it. In this paper, we model the roles that broadband use at school and Internet adoption in neighboring households play in the decision to adopt the Internet at home and measure their effects empirically. We use data from Portugal between 2006 and 2009 on household Internet penetration and on how much schools use broadband. We use two different sets of instruments for the schools’ broadband use to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Both approaches yield similar results. We find that broadband use at school leads to higher levels of Internet penetration in neighboring households. Broadband use in schools was responsible for a year-over-year increase of 3.5 percentage points on Internet penetration in households with children. Across our data set this effect accounts for about 17% of the increase in home Internet adoption. We also find evidence of regional spillovers in Internet adoption across households. These were roughly responsible for an increase of 2.1 percentage points in Internet penetration or 38% of the total increase in household Internet penetration between 2006 and 2009. These results show that wiring schools with broadband is an effective policy to lower the barriers for Internet adoption at home and as such contributes to accelerating the pace of broadband diffusion.<i>This paper was accepted by Lorin Hitt, information systems</i>.

Title: Portfolio Analysis Using Stochastic Dominance, Relative Entropy, and Empirical Likelihood
Abstract: This study formulates portfolio analysis in terms of stochastic dominance, relative entropy, and empirical likelihood. We define a portfolio inefficiency measure based on the divergence between given probabilities and the nearest probabilities that rationalize a given portfolio for some admissible utility function. When applied to a sample of time-series observations in a blockwise fashion, the inefficiency measure becomes a likelihood ratio statistic for testing inequality moment conditions. The limiting distribution of the test statistic is bounded by a chi-squared distribution under general sampling schemes, allowing for conservative large-sample testing. We develop a tight numerical approximation for the test statistic based on a two-stage optimization procedure and piecewise linearization techniques. A Monte Carlo simulation study of the empirical likelihood ratio test shows superior small-sample properties compared with various generalized method of moments tests. An application analyzes the efficiency of a passive stock market index in data sets from the empirical asset pricing literature.<i>This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, decision analysis</i>.

Title: Evidence on the Presence of Representativeness Bias in Investor Interpretation of Consistency in Sales Growth
Abstract: We document that consistent patterns of high or low sales growth that are incongruent with underlying fundamentals are followed by significant stock price reversals. In contrast, no stock return reversals are found for firms that achieve the same level of sales growth in an inconsistent manner. Furthermore, future earnings announcement returns mimic the pattern of abnormal stock returns documented for the Consistent- and Inconsistent-Growth portfolios, respectively, corroborating our main findings. Our results are robust to controls for the magnitude of sales growth, fundamental strength, business cycle risk exposures, and standard risk factors. Our evidence is consistent with representativeness bias affecting investor interpretation of consistency in sales growth patterns.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting</i>.

Title: The Role of Sales Agents in Information Disclosure: Evidence from a Field Experiment
Abstract: With a large nationwide retailer, we run a natural field experiment to measure the effects of energy use information disclosure, customer rebates, and sales agent incentives on demand for energy-efficient durable goods. Although a combination of large rebates plus sales incentives substantially increases market share, information and sales incentives alone each have zero statistical effect and explain at most a small fraction of the low baseline market share. Sales agents strategically comply only partially with the experiment, targeting information to more interested consumers but not discussing energy efficiency with the disinterested majority. These results suggest that seller-provided information is not a major barrier to energy-efficiency investments at current prices in this context.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2327">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2327</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: When Retailing and Las Vegas Meet: Probabilistic Free Price Promotions
Abstract: A number of retailers offer gambling- or lottery-type price promotions with a chance to receive one’s entire purchase for free. Although these retailers seem to share the intuition that probabilistic free price promotions are attractive to consumers, it is unclear how they compare to traditional sure price promotions of equal expected monetary value. We compared these two risky and sure price promotions for planned purchases across six experiments in the field and in the laboratory. Together, we found that consumers are not only more likely to purchase a product promoted with a probabilistic free discount over the same product promoted with a sure discount but that they are also likely to purchase more of it. This preference seems to be primarily due to a diminishing sensitivity to the prices. In addition, we find that the zero price effect, transaction cost, and novelty considerations are likely not implicated.<i>This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, judgment and decision making</i>.

Title: On the Effectiveness of Uniform Subsidies in Increasing Market Consumption
Abstract: We study the problem faced by a central planner trying to increase the consumption of a good, such as new malaria drugs in Africa. The central planner allocates subsidies to its producers, subject to a budget constraint and endogenous market response. The policy most commonly implemented in practical applications of this problem is <i>uniform</i>, in the sense that it allocates the same per-unit subsidy to every firm, primarily because of its simplicity and perceived fairness. Surprisingly, we identify sufficient conditions of the firms’ marginal costs such that uniform subsidies are optimal, even if the firms’ efficiency levels are arbitrarily different. Moreover, this insight is usually preserved even if the central planner is uncertain about the specific market conditions. Further in many cases, uniform subsidies simultaneously attain the best social welfare solution. Additionally, simulation results in relevant settings where uniform subsidies are not optimal suggest that they induce a nearly optimal market consumption. On the other hand, if the firms face a fixed cost of entry to the market, then the performance of uniform subsidies can be significantly worse, suggesting the need for an alternative policy in this setup.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.

Title: Product Policy in Markets with Word-of-Mouth Communication
Abstract: We investigate the equilibrium relationship between product quality and word-of-mouth (WOM) communication. Specifically, we ask whether firms should optimally produce “better” products when consumers are more likely to exchange information. The critical moderating factor in our model is the nature of the communication and what its primary impact is. We first look at WOM that expands awareness of a product. We show that quality may either increase or decrease as WOM expands. The answer depends, in part, on the extent to which the expansion of WOM is one of scale alone or whether it also fundamentally changes the structure of communications. Next, we examine a model in which the primary impact of WOM is to help people to evaluate the utility provided by products with which they are already familiar. Our model suggests that more WOM in this context should always lead to higher-quality products. We demonstrate that the underlying driver of this result is that the elasticity of demand with respect to quality is increasing in the proportion of consumers who are informed about the product’s quality. Taken together, the two models therefore suggest that the firm’s optimal product-policy response to the growth in social interactions depends on both the content and the structure of the underlying conversations. Finally, we compare both WOM models to analogous models of advertising and demonstrate that the firm’s optimal response to a decrease in advertising costs is quite different from that to an increase in WOM. The reason for these differences can be traced back to a fundamental distinction between advertising and WOM: although the former is optimized, the latter is far more random.<i>This paper was accepted by J.

Title: Person–Organization Fit and Incentives: A Causal Test
Abstract: We investigate the effects of organizational culture and personal values on performance under individual and team contest incentives. We develop a model of regard for others and in-group favoritism that predicts interaction effects between organizational values and personal values in contest games. These predictions are tested in a computerized lab experiment with exogenous control of both organizational values and incentives. In line with our theoretical model, we find that prosocial (proself)-orientated subjects exert more (less) effort in team contests in the primed prosocial organizational values condition, relative to the neutrally primed baseline condition. Further, when the prosocial organizational values are combined with individual contest incentives, prosocial subjects no longer outperform their proself counterparts. These findings provide, to our knowledge, a first, affirmative, causal test of person–organization fit theory. They also suggest the importance of a “triple-fit” between personal preferences, organizational values, and incentive mechanisms for prosocially orientated individuals.<i>This paper was accepted by John List, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: Determinants and Trading Performance of Equity Deferrals by Corporate Outside Directors
Abstract: This study investigates the determinants and trading performance of outside directors’ equity deferrals, which represent the choice to convert part or all of their annual cash compensation into deferred company stock. Using a large sample of S&P 1500 firms that allowed directors to defer their cash fees into equity between 1999 and 2009, we find significant associations between equity deferral choices and specific features of the director compensation plans, proxies for directors’ outside wealth diversification, and future firm stock market performance. Trading performance analyses indicate that outside directors earn substantial abnormal returns from their deferrals, with a significant proportion of the deferral transactions occurring during blackout periods. These results are consistent with companies structuring director equity deferral plans to circumvent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5’s trading restrictions.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary E.

Title: Do Preference Reversals Disappear When We Allow for Probabilistic Choice?
Abstract: The “preference reversal phenomenon,” a systematic disparity between people’s valuations and choices, poses challenges for theory and policy. Using a very general formulation of probabilistic preferences, we show that the phenomenon is not mainly due to intransitive choice. We find a high degree of regularity <i>within</i> choice tasks and also <i>within</i> valuation tasks, but the two types of tasks appear to evoke very different cognitive processes, even when the experimental environment tries to minimise differences. We discuss possible implications for modelling and eliciting preferences.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2333">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2333</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Manel Baucells, decision analysis</i>.

Title: Pricing Variation Within Dual-Distribution Chains: The Different Implications of Externalities and Signaling for High- and Low-Quality Brands
Abstract: Within many of the multioutlet branded chains that dominate the retail and services landscape, the organizational form (e.g., company management, franchising) used to manage an outlet varies from site to site, as do the prices charged at those sites. I propose that organizational form and prices may be systematically related as a result of brand externalities. In particular, I develop logic that the relevant form of externality should differ for upper quality tier brands and lower tier brands. Using panel data on price and organizational form from more than 6,700 branded U.S. hotels affiliated with 40 “dual-distribution” brands—those brands that simultaneously company manage and franchise individual outlets—I find that, consistent with the brand externality arguments, company-managed locations have higher prices within high-quality chains, whereas franchisees price higher in the lower tiers.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy</i>.

Title: How Do Delay Announcements Shape Customer Behavior? An Empirical Study
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of delay announcements using an empirical approach by analyzing the data from a medium-sized call center. We first explore the question of whether delay announcements impact customers’ behavior using a nonparametric approach. The answer to this question appears to be ambiguous. We thus turn to investigate the fundamental mechanism by which delay announcements impact customer behavior, by constructing a dynamic structural model. In contrast to the implicit assumption made in the literature that announcements do not directly impact customers’ waiting costs, our key insights show that delay announcements not only impact customers’ beliefs about the system but also directly impact customers’ waiting costs. In particular, customers’ per-unit waiting cost decreases with the offered waiting times associated with the announcements. The results of our counterfactual analysis show that it may not be necessary to provide announcements with very fine granularity.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.

Title: Can Contracts Signal Social Norms? Experimental Evidence
Abstract: We investigate whether incentive schemes signal social norms and thus affect behavior beyond their direct economic consequences. A one-shot principal–agent experiment is studied where prior to contract choice principals are informed about the past actions of other agents and thus have more information about norms of behavior. Compared with a setting in which principals are uninformed, agents exert substantially higher effort under a fixed wage contract when they are aware that an informed principal chose this contract. The informed principal’s choice apparently signals a norm not to exploit trust, which leads to more trustworthy behavior. This mechanism’s robustness is explored in further experiments.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2336">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2336</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Uri Gneezy, behavioral economics</i>.

Title: How Much Is a Win Worth? An Application to Intercollegiate Athletics
Abstract: Intercollegiate athletics in the United States have become a multibillion-dollar industry over the past several decades. In this study, we investigate the short- and long-term direct monetary effects of operating a winning athletics program for an academic institution of higher education. We construct a unique panel data set from multiple sources and utilize the latest dynamic panel data estimation methods to account for heterogeneity while also addressing endogeneity concerns. We find that success in men’s football and basketball has a significant impact on a school’s respective football and basketball revenues; however, the effect is different based on the type of school. We find that regular season wins in football account for most of the increase in revenue for established schools, whereas invitations to prestigious postseason bowl games play a big part for less-established schools. Furthermore, we find that student population and education quality dissipate the effect of athletic success on monetary payoffs. We find that success in basketball carries over more from the past than in football with additional contemporaneous marginal effects for established schools. We do find, however, that past athletic success carries over significantly to the present in both football and basketball, suggesting the significance of the long-term monetary effect of athletic success to many academic institutions in the United States.<i>This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing</i>.

Title: Newsvendor Mergers
Abstract: This paper studies a merger between price-setting newsvendors in an oligopolistic market. It is well known that inventory pooling can greatly reduce inventory costs in a centralized distribution system because it helps reduce aggregate demand uncertainty. Although such statistical economies of scale are important benefits of a retail merger, the extant literature models cost savings from a merger only through reduction in a postmerger firm’s marginal cost. In this paper, we develop a model of a retail merger under uncertain demand that distinguishes between cost savings from conventional economies of scale and those from statistical economies of scale, and we show that these two sources of cost savings have substantially different impacts on firms’ decisions in a postmerger market. Contrary to the existing theory of mergers developed under deterministic demand, we find that although inventory pooling enables the postmerger firm to achieve cost savings, it always induces firms to raise their prices, and we find that marginal cost reduction induces firms to lower their prices only when it is substantial—consequently, larger cost synergies can benefit even nonparticipant firms. Finally, even if a merger induces all firms to raise their prices, it can still improve expected consumer welfare by increasing firms’ service levels under uncertain demand.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.

Title: Corporate Governance, Accounting Conservatism, and Manipulation
Abstract: We develop a model to analyze how board governance affects firms’ financial reporting choices and managers’ incentives to manipulate accounting reports. In our setting, ceteris paribus, conservative accounting is desirable because it allows the board of directors to better oversee the firm’s investment decisions. This feature of conservatism, however, causes the manager to manipulate the accounting system to mislead the board and distort its decisions. Effective reporting oversight curtails managers’ ability to manipulate, which increases the benefits of conservative accounting and simultaneously reduces its costs. Our model predicts that stronger reporting oversight leads to greater accounting conservatism, manipulation, and investment efficiency.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting</i>.

Title: Judgment Extremity and Accuracy Under Epistemic vs. Aleatory Uncertainty
Abstract: People view uncertain events as knowable in principle (<i>epistemic</i> uncertainty), as fundamentally random (<i>aleatory</i> uncertainty), or as some mixture of the two. We show that people make more extreme probability judgments (i.e., closer to 0 or 1) for events they view as entailing more epistemic uncertainty and less aleatory uncertainty. We demonstrate this pattern in a domain where there is agreement concerning the balance of evidence (pairings of teams according to their seed in a basketball tournament) but individual differences in the perception of the epistemicness/aleatoriness of that domain (Study 1), across a range of domains that vary in their perceived epistemicness/aleatoriness (Study 2), in a single judgment task for which we only vary the degree of randomness with which events are selected (Study 3), and when we prime participants to see events as more epistemic or aleatory (Study 4). Decomposition of accuracy scores suggests that the greater judgment extremity of more epistemic events can manifest itself as a trade-off between enhanced resolution and diminished calibration. We further relate our findings to the hard–easy effect and also show that differences between epistemic and aleatory judgment are amplified when judges have more knowledge concerning relevant events.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2344">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2344</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, judgment and decision making</i>.

Title: The Strategic Role of Business Insurance
Abstract: The use of business insurance has been traditionally studied in a single-firm setting, but in reality preventing operational accidents involves the (unobservable) efforts of multiple firms. We show that, in a multifirm setting, insurance can be used strategically as a commitment mechanism to prevent excessive free riding by other firms. In the presence of wealth imbalances, contracts alone leave wealth-constrained firms with inefficiently low incentives to exert effort (because of limited liability) and firms with sufficient wealth with excessive incentives. Insurance allows the latter to credibly commit to lower effort, thereby mitigating the incentives of the wealth-constrained firms to free ride. This finding shows that insurance can improve the efficiency of risk management efforts by decreasing free-riding problems.<i>This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management</i>.

Title: Intertemporal Uncertainty Avoidance: When the Future Is Uncertain, People Prefer the Present, and When the Present Is Uncertain, People Prefer the Future
Abstract: Three studies explored the effects of uncertainty on people’s time preferences for financial gains and losses. In general, individuals seek to avoid uncertainty in situations of intertemporal choice. While holding the expected value of payouts constant, participants preferred immediate gains and losses if the future was uncertain, and preferred future gains and losses if the present was uncertain. This pattern of preferences is incompatible with current models of intertemporal choice, in which people should consistently prefer to have gains now and losses later. This pattern of uncertainty avoidance is also not explained by prospect theory models, which predict risk seeking for losses. We discuss these findings in relation to previous literature.Data, as supplemental material, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2349">http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2349</ext-link>.<i>This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, judgment and decision making</i>.

Title: Factors Associated with the Year-End Decline in Working Capital
Abstract: Working capital is an important indicator of firm operational efficiency. All else being equal, lower levels signal greater efficiency. Managers are thus likely to be motivated to report lower levels of working capital at times of greater external attention. We find that working capital levels decrease in the fourth fiscal quarter significantly more than expected, conditional on seasonal changes in economic activity. The decrease subsequently reverses in the following first fiscal quarter. Evidence indicates that firms manage down year-end working capital through transactions that increase year-end operating cash flow and that firms spread this activity over all working capital accounts. Finally, the temporary decrease in year-end working capital is correlated with compensation benchmarks and analysts’ annual cash flow forecasts. The temporary drop is also more pronounced for firms with industry dominance.<i>This paper was accepted by Mary Barth, accounting</i>.

Title: Learning by Doing in Multiproduct Manufacturing: Variety, Customizations, and Overlapping Product Generations
Abstract: Extending research on organizational learning to multiproduct environments is of particular importance given that the vast majority of products are manufactured in such environments. We investigate learning in a multiproduct facility drawing on exceptionally rich data for a manufacturing firm that is a leading producer of high-technology hardware components. Weekly data for 10 years from the firm’s production and human resource tracking systems are augmented by surveys of managers and engineers and by extensive firsthand observation. We find that productivity improves when multiple generations of the firm’s primary product family are produced concurrently, reflecting the firm’s ability to augment and transfer knowledge from older to newer product generations. No significant transfer of knowledge is evident between the primary product family and other products. Productivity is, however, adversely affected when the production facility is faced with extensive within-product buyer-specific customizations. We develop the implications of these findings for theory and practice.<i>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management</i>.

Title: Mitigating Delays and Unfairness in Appointment Systems
Abstract: We consider an appointment system where heterogeneous participants are sequenced and scheduled for service. Because service times are uncertain, the aims are to mitigate the unpleasantness experienced by the participants in the system when their waiting times or delays exceed acceptable thresholds and to address fairness in the balancing of service levels among participants. To evaluate uncertain delays, we propose the Delay Unpleasantness Measure, which takes into account the frequency and intensity of delays above a threshold, and introduce the concept of lexicographic min-max fairness to design appointment systems from the perspective of the worst-off participants. We focus our study in the healthcare industry in balancing physicians’ overtime and patients’ waiting times in which patients are distinguished by their service time characterizations. The model can be adapted in the robust setting when the underlying probability distribution is not fully available. To capture the correlation between uncertain service times, we suggest using the mean absolute deviations as the descriptive statistics in the distributional uncertainty set to preserve the linearity of the model. The optimal sequencing and scheduling decisions can be derived by solving a sequence of mixed-integer programming problems, and we report the insights from our computational studies.<i>This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization</i>.

Title: Information Sampling, Belief Synchronization, and Collective Illusions
Abstract: We demonstrate that a sampling-based mechanism can offer an alternative explanation for belief synchronization in social groups and the persistence of collective illusions. Our model assumes that people are more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to explain belief synchronization: a strong majority of opinions will likely emerge in favor of one alternative. The reason is that the group is unlikely to move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular. If by chance most people come to dislike alternative A, they are all unlikely to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same. When A is in fact the best alternative, a collective illusion has emerged because people mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best. Our model implies that such a collective illusion is persistent. The model thus offers an existence proof that a collective illusion can occur even in settings where people do not infer that popular alternatives are better. The model also casts new light on the effect of online recommendation systems on attitude homogenization and the effect of majority voting on beliefs and attitudes.<i>This paper was accepted by Yuval Rottenstreich, judgment and decision making</i>.

Title: When Suppliers Climb the Value Chain: A Theory of Value Distribution in Vertical Relationships
Abstract: Although offshore outsourcing has become an important strategy to lower production costs among Western firms, it gives rise to the phenomenon of value chain climbing—suppliers in emerging markets can develop capabilities by supplying, with aspirations to compete with the buyers in the product market. We build an analytical model to study the impact of value chain climbing on value distribution in vertical relationships. The analysis identifies a set of dominant relationships, characterizes how the buyer’s optimal choice among these relationships depends on firms’ relative competitiveness in the product market and the supplier’s speed of capability development, and shows how the optimal choice evolves with the dynamics of the supplier’s capability development. The results provide new insights into our understanding of value distribution in vertical relationships across different contexts and over time. By endogenizing the supplier’s entry into the product market, our study enriches the literatures on vertical relationships, market entry, and the management of global value chains.<i>This paper was accepted by Bruno Cassiman, business strategy</i>.
