Title: Some New Statistical Techniques Applicable to Operations Research
Abstract: The task of describing new statistical methods which have potential use in operations research is not an easy one; many of you have attained a level of statistical knowledge to which I cannot pretend, and the field of statistics is expanding so rapidly that one could not hope to do justice to the topic in a short time. Consequently, rather than attempt to list the many developments which might be of interest, I will describe three methods which I have found of particular interest and usefulness.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: New Mathematical Methods in Operations Research
Abstract: On the somewhat infrequent occasions when a mathematician looks at the practical problems of operations research, his first impression is apt to be that only known and elementary parts of mathematics are needed. But if he dwells with the subject longer, his reaction tends to be quite the opposite: he begins to realize that, when rightly conceived and formulated, these practical problems often turn on mathematical questions deep enough to go beyond existing knowledge and to require for their answer research into new mathematical fields.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Reliability of Airborne Radar Equipment
Abstract: One of the current aims in the design of electronic machines is the development of higher performance equipment utilizing, where possible, automatic control, guidance, and computing features. The incorporation of these features generally results in more complex and, hence, less reliable equipment. Since many situations requiring highly complex machinery also require a high degree of reliability, designers and users alike are confronted with the problems of deciding what degree of reliability in a given operation is acceptable and of determining the degree of complexity in a machine that will decrease the reliability beyond this acceptable value. The present paper examines these questions as they pertain to airborne radar equipment, whose growth in complexity in recent years has paralleled that of Naval electronics in general.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Optimum Distribution of Effort
Abstract: When a limited amount of effort is available for the performance of two related tasks, the practical of how it is to be divided between them in order to obtain the best over-all result is one which constantly arises in operations research.

Title: The Effect of Promotional Effort on Sales
Abstract: The management of an industrial enterprise is constantly faced with the problem of deciding how much advertising, selling, or promotional effort is economically justified. A reasonable response to this question implies at least an intuitive knowledge of the relation between sales volume and promotional effort. This paper presents a case study of the development of such a relationship.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Mathematical Note on Sub-Optimization
Abstract: Of the several points discussed in the previous paper [Hitch, C. J. 1953. <i>Jour. Op. Res. Soc.

Title: The Theory of Value and the Science of Decision a Summary
Abstract: Operations research is defined as “the science of decision.” It is necessary, therefore, to understand the rationale and operation of the decision process. Decision is primarily based upon two quantities: (1) the <i>probability</i> with which certain immediate outcomes may result if a given course of action is taken; and (2) the <i>value</i> or worth of these outcomes. The product of probability times value summed over all the possible outcomes is the expected value, or simply the <i>expectation</i>. The course of action which leads to the highest expectation is the indicated choice of the decision. Decision means preference, and preference can be expressed only between like quantities. Thus, the problem in establishing a set of values is to establish a numerical function which will enable the ranking of preference of states or conditions.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Linear Programming and Profit Preference Scheduling for a Manufacturing Firm
Abstract: Many business, economic, and engineering problems involve devising means of achieving optimal results in the face of a series of restrictions. These restrictions may assume a variety of forms. Plant or machine capacities, labor requirements, market restrictions, procedural and policy conditions, financial limitations, etc., are examples common to many kinds of business. Other examples may be specialized to more narrow groups of firms. It is, therefore, desirable to develop modes of attacking such problems which will provide a general and economical method of (1) determining best or optimal solutions within the stipulated limitations and (2) assessing the <i>economic</i> cost of the restrictions and, therefore, the worthwhileness of altering them.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Failure of Complex Equipment
Abstract: This paper had its origin in consideration of the work reported on by D. M. Boodman [Boodman, D. M. 1953. The reliability of airborne radar equipment. <i>Jour. Op. Res. Soc. America</i> <b>1</b> (February) 39--45.]. The purpose is to examine some of the implications arising from the assumption that a piece of complex equipment fails when, and only when, one of its component parts fails. The equipment is assumed made up of many individual parts, each of which is liable to prime failure independent of all other parts. Two different initial conditions are assumed at the beginning of observation or operation: (a) all components are new; (b) the equipment has been operating for a long time, components that have failed having been replaced by new ones at the time of failure. We consider the probability of failure of the equipment as a function of time and of the survival curve of individual components, and the possible improvement of reliability of equipment by replacement of components at a given age.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Operations Research and the Management Consultant
Abstract: The genesis of management consulting is somewhat obscured in the mists of time. However, the profession's written history begins with the work of Frederick W. Taylor, Henry L. Gantt, Emerson, and other pioneers of scientific management, who began their work around 1885. At that time they formulated the doctrine that scientific methods of analysis and measurement could and should be used in matters of production, and that wherever possible, business decisions should be based on facts rather than on somebody's intuition or emotional reaction. The original emphasis was on work in the production area, since here facts could be readily accumulated, experiments executed and results followed within a limited area of observation.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Sub-Optimization in Operations Problems
Abstract: The validity and therefore the usefulness of operations research depend upon the skill with which projects are designed and particularly upon the shrewdness with which criteria (“payoffs,” “objectives functions”) are selected. The criterion problem has been relatively neglected in operations research literature, and has apparently usually been “solved” in practice by assuming the first plausible payoff function which springs to mind; or if several spring to mind, by trying all and compromising (or letting a commander compromise) among the results of alternative computations. The problem is much too important for such casual treatment. Calculating quantitative solutions using the wrong criteria is equivalent to answering the wrong questions. Unless operations research develops methods of evaluating criteria and choosing good ones, its quantitative methods may prove worse than useless to its clients in its new applications in government and industry.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Trends in Operations Research
Abstract: The field of operations research has been rapidly growing this past year. The Operations Research Society of America has been founded and now has about 500 members. More and more large companies---aircraft and electrical manufacturers, railroads and oil companies, insurance companies and department stores---are forming their own operations-research groups or are buying consulting services in operations research. It will not be long before more positions will be open in industrial than in military operations research. We should no longer have trouble explaining the scope and methods of operations research to the layman. We already can say: <i>Operations research is the activity carried on by members of the Operations Research Society; its methods are those reported in our J<sc>ournal</sc></i>. Very soon this definition will be more instructive and convincing than any number of special explanatory articles and talks.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Operational Research as a Science
Abstract: We hear a lot these days about a type of research in which the objects studied, instead of being either materials or machines or people, are the activities of all these together---research into “operations.” To many, operational research conjures up a vision of a busy executive seated at his desk faced with the almost unending problem of making decisions. Everything depends on the speed and correctness with which he makes these decisions, and these in turn depend on the way the facts and factors are presented to him and on his judgment or his ability to weigh them up. Someone tells him about a new tool to help him---the “scientific method.” Finding this tool rather heavy and intricate, he employs specialists to help him, people trained in the scientific method, i.e., scientists. Thus is born an operational research section such as is now to be found in numerous organizations and industries in Britain and the United States.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Comparison of Stochastic and Direct Methods for the Solution of Some Special Problems
Abstract: The amount of computing work required to reach a given precision by stochastic and by various direct methods is estimated for certain special problems. These comprise the evaluation of the definite integrals of functions of various types over multidimensional domains, the solution of partial differential equations over various domains, and problems of multiple scattering. The conclusion is reached that, although stochastic methods may be useful for rough surveys, precise results will usually require much less work by direct methods.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Application of Operations-Research Techniques to Airborne Weapon System Planning
Abstract: It is believed that the extension and application of operations research techniques to systems analysis can improve the basis for decisions on new airborne weapon systems. Although the surface has only been scratched in this field and many things are yet to be learned, experience to date has provided reason for confidence that these methods will prove to be reliable and useful tools for the executive over the years. As experience and know-how increase, and sufficient groups of qualified personnel become available in both industry and the military, such analyses should become recognized as matters of good business procedure. It is to be hoped that in the future standard practice both in industry and in the Department of Defense will require that systems analyses be performed in advance of all basic planning decisions for design and production of future weapon systems.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Development of Planning Procedures at Air Proving Ground Command
Abstract: Sophisticated models and complex mathematical formulations are not always necessary for the development of successful planning techniques. Often rather simple and straightforward algebraic statements will serve management's purposes very well. Since planning is in essence prediction, precision of prediction is desirable. Although a relatively simple and direct planning method may lose in precision, it has certain major advantages: (1) timeliness through quick development and application; (2) ease of application; and (3) an understanding of the model on the part of management, who must take action on the basis of the predictions. Often these advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of loss of precision.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Analogue Computations of Business Decisions
Abstract: The role of modern computing machinery is a rapidly expanding one with interest being shown in a wide variety of fields. In a sense this arrival of the era of mechanized computation has had a twofold effect. Not only has it meant a release from mathematical drudgery, but it has opened the way for the careful formulation of problems heretofore dealt with in only a qualitative manner or by only the grossest approximation to quantitative reasoning. This paper represents one of the growing number of efforts that start with the assumption that computational ability is not the serious limiting condition that it has been. From there it proceeds to try to answer two questions: How should rational business decisions be made? What kind of computer will be necessary to put the computational problem within reach?<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Sampling Methods in Railroad Accounting
Abstract: When a package is shipped by rail from one point to another, a <i>waybill</i> is prepared at the originating freight office. This document shows, among other things, the total freight amount of the shipment. When a less-than-carload (<sc>lcl</sc>) shipment involves more than one railroad, the revenue from the shipment is apportioned (at the end of each month) among the participating carriers. Theoretically, it would be possible to compute for each individual waybill the required divisions of the revenue, in accordance with existing rate tables, ICC regulations, agreements, routing charts, etc., but, because of the tremendous number of <sc>lcl</sc> shipments, a monthly ‘100 per cent count’ would be prohibitive from the standpoint of cost and because of the lack of trained personnel. Consequently, railroads have agreed on a ‘percentage plan’ for making <sc>lcl</sc> ‘interline settlements.’<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Methods of Reducing Sample Size in Monte Carlo Computations
Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of increasing the efficiency of Monte Carlo calculations. The methods of doing so permit one to reduce the sample size required to produce estimates of a fixed level of accuracy or, alternatively, to increase the accuracy of the estimates for a fixed cost of computation. Few theorems are known with regard to optimal sampling schemes, but several helpful ideas of very general applicability are available for use in designing Monte Carlo sampling schemes. Three of these ideas are discussed and illustrated in simple cases. These ideas are (1) correlation of samples, (2) importance sampling, and (3) statistical estimation.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Combat Problems, Weapon Systems, and the Theory of Allocation
Abstract: In an earlier issue of this journal, Charles Hitch [Charles Hitch. 1953. <i>J. Opns. Res. Soc. Am.</i> <b>1</b> 87.] discussed the problem of selecting criteria for evaluating the outcome of operations, saying, “The only discipline I know which has made any attempt to explore the characteristics of operations criteria and the intimately related question of the relation between lower and higher level sub-optimization is economic theory.” This paper, following Hitch, uses the standard tools of economic analysis to shed some light on the selection of criteria in operational problems. Some aspects of the military allocations problem are examined. For purposes of illustration the analysis deals with allocation in the army, but it applies equally well to all three armed services.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Utilization of Negro Manpower in the Army
Abstract: In connection with a basic policy decision by the Army in 1951 on the utilization of Negro manpower, a partly quantitative operations research study was made. Factors affecting the decision to integrate Negroes into previously all-white. Army units included statistics of scores on the Army's General Classification Test, Negro and white performance in combat, and interactions between Negro and white soldiers as determined from attitudes, opinions, critical incidents, and actual behavior. It is concluded that integrated (white and Negro) units can make more effective use of available manpower than segregated units, that resistance to integration is reduced as experience in integrated units is gained, and that levels of 20 per cent Negroes and more are acceptable. The time required to extend integration to the whole Army is discussed, and difficulties presented in such a manner that a sound program can be devised.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Experimental Determination of Guided Missile Reliability
Abstract: If the number of different environmental stresses to which guided missile components and systems are exposed were limited to one or two, suitable experimental design would make laboratory determination of their reliability feasible. In view of the fact, however, that a missile is exposed to a complex of different stresses, there is no practical way in which reliability evaluation can be accomplished through test procedures. On the other hand, it is quite possible to obtain useful estimates of the reliability of the whole missile from the results of a flight-test program. Since this technique will come close to duplicating the environmental stress encountered in tactical flight, a simple ratio of successful flights to total flights will itself yield considerable information. This figure can be refined through the use of moving averages, and reliability estimates can be further validated by presenting the results in terms of confidence belts instead of point estimates.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Comparison of Order Structures for Automatic Digital Computers
Abstract: The choice of design parameters of automatic digital computers represents compromises among many factors. Some of these factors are programing convenience, speed of operation, ease of maintenance, efficiency of storage, cost of implementation, number precision, and machine capacity. The choice of particular values of a design parameter is simplified if the effect of the parameter on some of the indicated factors can be measured. A method is developed which results in a numerical measure of the effect of order types on speed and storage efficiency. This method and considerations of equipment cost are applied to a company payroll calculation in order to determine which of two specific order types is preferable. In addition to testing order type, some estimate of the equipment required to implement these order types is made. Only generally accepted features of the organization of automatic digital computers are assumed for this analysis. The example illustrating an application of this method is taken from actual experience and indicates the kind of information designers and potential customers should have in order to evaluate the performance of automatic digital computing equipment. Some of the detailed programing used in illustrating the method is included. Sample tabulations are also included and show how numerical measures of performance are calculated.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Problem of Testing for the Fraction of Defectives
Abstract: A balance is sought between (1) the cost of testing for reliability and (2) the risks, because of limiting the testing, of either accepting an insufficiently reliable product or rejecting a sufficiently reliable one. The latter risk is generally less serious than the former. With a suitably defined pay-off function, “optimum” parameters are obtained both for a fixed-size test and a sequential test of the type introduced by Wald. The mathematical treatment is valid except for very high reliabilities. Modifications are discussed for (i) an optimum sequential test when the pay-off function includes some uncertainty as to what is meant by sufficiently reliable, and (ii) an optimum sequential test between two rival products.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Priority Assignment in Waiting Line Problems
Abstract: There are several commonly occurring situations in which the position of a unit or member of a waiting line is determined by a priority assigned to the unit rather than by its time of arrival in the line. An example is the line formed by messages awaiting transmission over a crowded communication channel in which urgent messages may take precedence over routine ones. With the passage of time a given unit may move forward in the line owing to the servicing of units at the front of the line or may move back owing to the arrival of units holding higher priorities. Though it does not provide a complete description of this process, the average elapsed time between the arrival in the line of a unit of a given priority and its admission to the facility for servicing is useful in evaluating the procedure by which priority assignments are made. Expressions for this quantity are derived for two cases---the single-channel system in which the unit servicing times are arbitrarily distributed (Eq. 3) and the multiple-channel system in which the servicing times are exponentially distributed (Eq. 6). In both cases it is assumed that arrivals occur at random.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Traffic Delays at Toll Booths
Abstract: The collection of vehicular tolls at Port Authority tunnels and bridges is one of the most important operations conducted by the police personnel. More than 250 traffic officers are utilized, and the payroll costs exceed a million dollars annually. In staffing its toll plazas the Port Authority attempts to handle traffic with a minimum number of toll collectors consistent with uniformly good service to the public and properly spaced relief periods for the toll collectors. This requires finding the level of traffic delays that gives the best compromise between the conflicting objectives of economy and service. In the past the number of toll collectors provided for operating a toll plaza was determined by judgment based on experience and a rule-of-thumb work standard which had not been related to service. Judgment was likewise used to allocate manpower and control the number of toll booths opened at any time. This method resulted in patron delays observed to vary from 2 to 50 sec. The tools of probability theory provide methods for dealing with the problem in quantitative terms. They enable determination of the relations between traffic volumes, number of toll booths, and grade of service. With this knowledge the optimum grade of service can be established in a logical manner and the number of toll booths required at any time of day can be specified in advance. Use of this method permitted savings in toll collection expenses and better service.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Influence of Servicing Times in Queuing Processes
Abstract: A relation between the distribution of customer-servicing times and that of customer-waiting times is derived for the case of a single-channel queue with random arrivals and the rule of “first come, first served” establishing the order of service. The queue is assumed to be in a state of statistical equilibrium. The relation holds for a large class of the servicing-time distributions that occur in practice, in particular the cases of constant, exponential, and Type III Pearson servicing times. The derivation takes into account changes in the magnitude of demand from customer to customer, changes that may exist in many of the situations in which the theory is likely to be applied. Using the theory, the characteristics of the waiting-time distributions associated with several specific types of servicing-time distributions are discussed. It is shown that if it is possible to make the right sort of alterations in servicing-time distributions considerable reduction in customer waiting times can be made. The analytical results are illustrated with graphs.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Application of Transportation Theory to Scheduling a Military Tanker Fleet
Abstract: A complete set of voyages for the tankers of the military fleet was computed so as to minimize the expected total distance to be traveled by the ships in ballast during the year ending 30 June 1950, based on deliveries according to the advance requirement estimates of the Armed Services Petroleum Purchasing Agency. The optimum route-schedule so computed required about 5 per cent less mileage in ballast than would a schedule consisting entirely of simple round trips. No comparisons have been made with actual operations to determine the extent of conformity between the computed schedule and the actual sailings. The object of the analysis was to test the analytical approach of Koopmans (Koopmans, Tjalling C., Stanley Reiter. 1951. A model of transportation. Tjalling C. Koopmans, ed. <i>Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation</i>. Proceedings of the Linear Programming Conference held at the University of Chicago, June 1949. Wiley, New York, 222--259.) on a fleet operation, as a first step in further development and application of such methods. The routeschedules obtained in this manner might well be compared with actual practice and the theory modified as necessary to allow for important factors not given proper attention in this first approximation. The author’s interest in the problem was aroused by papers on transportation theory presented by Koopmans (Koopmans, Tjalling C., Stanley Reiter. 1951. A model of transportation. Tjalling C. Koopmans, ed. <i>Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation</i>. Proceedings of the Linear Programming Conference held at the University of Chicago, June 1949. Wiley, New York, 222--259.) and Dantzig (Dantzig, George B. 1951. Application of the simplex method to a transportation problem. Tjalling C. Koopmans, ed. <i>Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation</i>. Proceedings of the Linear Programming Conference held at the University of Chicago, June 1949. Wiley, New York, 359--373.) at a conference on linear programing in Chicago during June 1949, under the auspices of The Cowles Commission for Research in Economics of The University of Chicago. Frank L. Hitchcock (Hitchcock, Frank L. 1941. The distribution of a product from several sources to numerous localities. <i>J. Math. Phys</i> <b>20</b> 224--230.), L. Kantorovitch (Kantorovitch, L. 1942. On the translocation of masses. <i>Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR</i>. <b>37</b> 199--201.), and Tjalling C. Koopmans (Koopmans, Tjalling C. 1949. Optimum utilization of the transportation system. <i>Econometrica</i> <b>17</b> (Supplement) 136--146.) have contributed independent formulations of this same theory, and each has offered a computational scheme. Professor Koopmans, in his <i>Introduction to the Chicago Conference Proceedings</i> (Koopmans, Tjalling C., Stanley Reiter. 1951. A model of transportation. Tjalling C. Koopmans, ed. <i>Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation</i>. Proceedings of the Linear Programming Conference held at the University of Chicago, June 1949. Wiley, New York, 222--259.), has discussed the interrelation of the conference papers---including the bearing of some of these on the Hitchcock distribution problem. The present author (Flood, Merrill M. 1953. On the Hitchcock distribution problem. <i>Pacific J. Math.</i> <b>3</b> 369--386.) has previously offered a computational scheme for treating the problem, including the troublesome degenerate cases. An extreme degenerate case is that known as the “personnel assignment problem,” as treated by Votaw and Orden (Votaw, D. F., A. Orden. 1952. The personnel assignment problem. Alex Orden, Leon Goldstein, eds. <i>Symposium on Linear Inequalities and Programming</i>. Project SCOOP, Hq. US Air Force. 155--163.) and von Neumann (John von Neumann. 1953.

Title: A Verification of Lanchester's Law
Abstract: The validity of Lanchester's equations is demonstrated in an actual combat situation where U.S. forces captured the island of Iwo Jima. The equations tested are <i>dM</i>/<i>dt</i> = <i>P</i>(<i>t</i>) - <i>AN</i>, and <i>dN</i>/<i>dt</i> = -<i>BM</i>, with
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><i>t</i> the time elapsed since the beginning of the engagement, measured in days;</list-item><list-item><i>M</i>(<i>t</i>), and <i>N</i>(<i>t</i>) the number of effective friendly and enemy troops, respectively;</list-item><list-item><i>A</i> and <i>B</i> the friendly and enemy combat loss rates, respectively, per opposing combatant; and</list-item><list-item><i>P</i>(<i>t</i>) the rate friendly troops enter combat.</list-item></list>
Information required for the verification is the number of friendly troops put ashore each day and the number of friendly casualties for each day of the engagement, knowledge that enemy troops are not reinforced or withdrawn, the number of enemy troops at the beginning and end of the engagement, and the time <i>T</i> at the end of the engagement. If the number of enemy troops at the beginning of the engagement is not known, but the time, <i>T</i>, when the enemy is <i>destroyed</i> is known, it is still possible to determine whether Lanchester's equations are valid. In the analysis of the capture of Iwo Jima, the equations were found to be applicable. The value of such analyses increases when repeated often enough to permit general conclusions to be drawn.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: An Approximate Measure of Value
Abstract: Selection of an optimum decision depends on two types of measures: (1) the efficiency of a course of action for an outcome; (2) the importance or weight of the outcomes. That course of action that maximizes the expected total weighted efficiency (effectiveness) is optimum. A method for estimating importance on a scale of value is provided. It is based on actual or verbal choices of decision-makers. The method can be applied to any number of objectives or outcomes, and to any number of decision-makers. Reliability of the results can be measured.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Organization and Information Handling in Task Groups
Abstract: Organizational factors in information handling in task-oriented groups have been studied recently at M.I.T. Laboratory groups were given very simple information-collection tasks under rigidly controlled conditions and the communication recorded completely. Decisions were restricted to choices of message destination and the influence of various imposed communication nets on the adequacy of group performance analysed. A technique of group-action quantization was used, which made possible a well-defined measure of group efficiency and an easily understood group goal. Experimental results show that an equiprobable random assumption is a poor model even for initial behavior. Centralized nets are shown to learn to do as well as the net permits fairly rapidly but to be characterized by high minimum-action. A net designed to give the lowest average action for task completion with random message-destination choices is shown to be essentially incapable of achieving its limiting minimum. Another similar net with a higher random average and a favorable minimum is shown to learn its minimum readily. Differences among the results for different nets are found to be explained in terms of a concept of “locally rational behavior” and the combinatorial characteristics of the nets.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Optimum Preventative Sampling
Abstract: The situation envisaged is that in which a number of articles of varying value and liability to defect are sampled and inspected, the ultimate aim being not so much to detect defects as to discourage their arisal. General results are obtained (see “The General Equations”), of which the following specific result is typical, under certain circumstances the optimum sampling fraction for those articles having value <i>v</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is approximately
<disp-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">\documentclass{aastex}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{bm}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{pifont}\usepackage{stmaryrd}\usepackage{textcomp}\usepackage{portland,xspace}\usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra}\pagestyle{empty}\DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6}\begin{document}$$f_{i} = F + \frac{1}{C} \log (v_{i}/v_{G}).$$\end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula>
Here <i>F</i> is the predetermined total sampling fraction, <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub> the geometric mean value of all articles, and <i>C</i> a coefficient measuring the deterrent effect of sampling on carelessness, etc. Under the same circumstances, the ratio of the expected total avoidable loss under optimum sampling to that under uniform sampling is approximately <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>/<i>v</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>, where <i>v</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> is the arithmetic mean article value. The ratio <i>v</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>/<i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub> thus provides a measure of the advantage to be expected in using an optimum sampling scheme.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Threats to the Growth of Operations Research in Business and Industry
Abstract: It is customary at annual meetings of professional societies such as ours, for the president to devote much or all of his retiring address to the many accomplishments and advances of the organization during the preceding year or years. In the case of ORSA we call point with some pride to our 40 per cent increase in membership, to the increased health and size of our J<sc>ournal</sc> and to other signs of healthy growth. Our optimism regarding past achievements should not be permitted to obscure, however, those dangers or threats to our continued development which may loom in the future. I propose, therefore, to be the devil's advocate and to depart from precedent by playing the part of a viewing-with-alarm prognosticator rather than that of a pointing-with-pride historian.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Mathematical Foundations and Computational Methods for a Digital Logic Machine
Abstract: The manipulations of the propositional calculus (and the analogous Boolean algebra) have recently become of fundamental importance in fields other than set theoretical proofs of pure mathematics. For example, in the analysis and evaluation of intelligence and military reports, preparation and analysis of tactical methods and principles, complex logical nonnumerical problems often arise more frequently than do problems of a numerical nature. Consequently there is the need for a systematic method of analyzing and solving propositional functions and equations. The purpose of this paper is to present the systematic rules of an “arithmetic” for handling propositional functions and equations, formulated in a manner amenable to easy computation and mechanization. Among the important results given are: (a) a simple method of expressing a propositional calculus in terms of the shortest digitalized words possible, (b) a systematic method for generating the simplest and absolute simplest forms for Boolean functions, (c) a method for systematically generating all true and false implications of given propositions, (d) a method for systematically generating all possible changes of variables (i.e., substitution of new variables) that can be made on a propositional calculus while preserving the logical meaning, and (e) the systematic generation of all solutions to any number of simultaneous propositional equations in any number of unknowns. The solution of this latter problem implies the ability to perform manipulations with propositional variables in a manner analogous to manipulations of ordinary algebraic equations. A number of illustrative applications to military situations are given, including an analysis of certain propositions and conclusions of Clausewitz.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Control of Inventories and Production Rates---A Survey
Abstract: The inventory and production control problem encompasses purchasing and ordering decisions, production-rate decisions, and scheduling decisions. Over the past twenty-five years there has been considerable study of ordering decisions, under “static” assumptions, and workable decision rules are available. Work on “dynamic” rules is still in an early stage, but a general framework of analysis, and several methods of approach have been developed. Production rate decisions have been investigated from the standpoint of servomechanism “feedback” theory, the calculus of variations, and several forecasting techniques. A combination of these approaches promises to yield simple, practical decision rules. The most urgent current research problem is to devise workable decision-making procedures for complex interrelated industrial situations by finding methods for “coupling” the decision rules that apply to the individual parts of the system. Industry has made some use of the “static” decision rules now available in the literature; there has yet been little application of the dynamic ordering and production rate rules.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Effect of Reliability of “Supervisory” Equipment on the Accuracy of a “Supervised” System
Abstract: This study deals with a basic system, the performance of which degenerates through random errors increasing with the square root of operating time. The probable circular error of this system can be made independent of the time by the addition to the system of supervisory equipment capable of periodic correction of the errors of the basic system. Assuming the supervisory equipment “fail safe” and subject to constant hazard type of failure, the performance of the supervised system is determined for various values of reliability of the supervisory equipment. It is shown that a great improvement in performance is possible even with unreliable supervision.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Feasibility Considerations in the Allocation of Resources to Military Programs
Abstract: In an earlier article (Kaechere, Alvin, Francis P. Hoeber. 1953. <i>J. Opns. Res. Soc. Am.</i> <b>1</b>, 286), the authors suggested an adaptation of some elementary economic theory to the development of criteria for answering three questions: Given a combat situation, what weapon systems should be used? In what proportions? How many? The suggested criteria provided for equating the marginal cost-effect ratios of two or more weapon systems. Suboptimization criteria for approaching this ideal were suggested. In this first approximation, it was assumed that the alternative weapons systems could be delivered within the period under consideration. The present paper treats the case in which it is not possible, in the time specified by the program, to obtain the quantity of a weapon system required by the optimum solution given by the static equilibrium analysis. This situation arises when some resource cannot be made available in the stated time, regardless of cost. Criteria for allocating resources under this constraint are suggested, using a model based on experience in past periods of mobilization, and one believed to be consistent with what may be expected to occur in a future mobilization.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Parametric Objective Function (Part 1)
Abstract: In the linear programming problem where there is a linear function to be optimized (called the objective function), it is desirable to study the behaviour of solutions when the (cost) coefficients in the objective function are parametrized. The problem is then to find the set of <i>x</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> (<i>j</i> = 1, 2, ..., <i>n</i>) which minimizes the linear form (sum)(<i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> + (lambda) <i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>') <i>x</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> and satisfy the constraints <i>x</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> (ge) 0 and (sum)<i>a</i><sub><i>ıj</i></sub><i>x</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub><i>ı</i>0</sub> (<i>i</i> = 1, 2, ..., <i>m</i>) where <i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>, <i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>', <i>a</i><sub><i>ıj</i></sub>, and <i>a</i><sub><i>ı</i>0</sub> are constants, with at least one <i>c</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> (ne) 0, and (lambda) a parameter. Using the simplex method, a computational procedure is described which enables one, given a feasible solution, to determine the values of the parameter (if any) for which the solution minimizes the objective function; and given a minimum feasible solution how one can generate by the simplex algorithm all minimum feasible solutions and the corresponding values of the parameter. To a minimum solution there corresponds one interval of values of (lambda) (nondegeneracy assumed). The process indicates how to obtain a new solution and the corresponding interval of values of (lambda) which is contiguous to the previous one both having only one point in common.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Information Theory and Man-Machine Systems
Abstract: Information theory has been used recently as the basis for some experimental studies of the abilities of humans as processors of information. One possible approach to the analysis of man-machine systems is to consider the implications of such experimental knowledge for the design of man-machine systems. The functions performed by human operators in these systems are primarily those of control of the energy resources of the system. Control functions involve, by their very nature, the availability of relevant information and the opportunity to transmit control decisions reached on the basis of this information. It is important not only that enough information be available to an operator in order to carry out his control responsibilities, but also that these tasks be not complicated unnecessarily by the provision of too much or irrelevant information. Moreover, in applying an informational analysis to control tasks, it is essential that consideration be given as to what sorts of categories are perceptually possible for operators since any analysis which does not take into account certain perceptual limitations of humans is likely to be invalid. Following this point of view it is suggested that intelligent design of man-machine systems involves compatibility between the control requirements of a system and the capabilities of the men in the system.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Erich Schneider's Inventory Control Analysis
Abstract: Much attention has been focussed on inventory control problems in this country in recent years by statisticians, economists, logisticians, and operations researchers. The author is aware of several instances where the discussion of these problems could have been substantially improved by knowledge of work completed by Professor Erich Schneider in 1938. The present article summarizes the principal results of this work, relates them to recent work accomplished in similar areas of operations research, and points out several similarities between Schneider's approach to the problem and the general philosophy of operations research.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Letter to the Editor---The Application of Operations-Research Methods to Athletic Games
Abstract: The possibility of applying scientific method to athletic games does not appear to have received much attention by the operations research community. Certain sports, such as football, baseball, and basketball, simulate warfare, and would seem to provide an excellent opportunity for teaching operations-research methods in “live” situations that are readily available to military schools and universities. The resemblance of football to ground combat is well known; baseball is analogous to a battle between two naval task forces; and basketball can be considered as a simulation of aerial warfare.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Abstract: In his article, “Priority Assignment In Waiting Line Problems,” (Cobham, <i>J. Opns. Res. Soc. Am.</i> <b>2</b>, 70 (1954).)

Title: Military Decision and Game Theory
Abstract: The United States military doctrine of decision prescribes that a commander select the course of action which offers the greatest promise of success in view of the enemy's capabilities of opposing him. This paper analyzes two battle decisions of World War II, and develops the analogy between existing military doctrine and the “theory of games” proposed by von Neumann. Current U.S. doctrine is conservative. The techniques of game theory permit analysis of the risk involved if the commander deviates from current doctrine to base his decision on his estimate of what his enemy intends to do rather than on what his enemy is capable of doing. The idea of “mixed strategies” presents more difficulties but may be useful, particularly for command decisions for small military organizations.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Industrial Economics and Operations Research at Stanford Research Institute
Abstract: The dynamic and profitable nature of American industry is dependent upon sound applied research in industrial economics in the same way that it is dependent upon the more frequently recognized applied research in technical fields. As a matter of fact, it is the combination of technical and economic research that accounts for much of the economy's profit, expansion, and productivity. Call it techno-economic research, or operations research if you wish. The purpose of this paper is not to propose definitions, but rather to give some examples of how companies are conducting research to arrive at decisions that affect their growth and health and that of the total economy. Then the reader may label this kind of research by whatever brand name appeals to him.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Optimum Operation of a Complex Activity Under Conditions of Uncertainty
Abstract: The model presented is suitable for determining the optimum manner of operation of a complex activity that depends on the maintenance of each of many subactivities, each subactivity being subject to uncertainty, measurable by a probability distribution. The activity discussed is the flying of planes at a base, the subactivities being the supply of spare parts. The first problem of the base is how many of each part to order. This has been satisfactorily solved by existing literature. The second problem is when to order, if the lack of any one of many different parts can ground an aircraft. It is this problem which the present paper solves. Consistent with stated assumptions, formulas are derived that yield minimum routine supply cost sets of reorder points (one reorder point for each part). Each set gives some specified protection against a plane being grounded because the base lacks one or more parts, at minimum cost, ignoring costs which arise from grounding of planes. Taking into account the costs that arise from the grounding of planes, such as the cost of rush requisitions and the need for additional aircraft and other considerations, a procedure is developed for choosing one set among all minimum cost sets which is optimum in an over-all sense. The solution is put in a form which can be used on a decentralized basis and under changing conditions. The use of the model under dynamic conditions is discussed. A variant of the main model is described which should be extremely useful for combat situations.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Numerical Solution of the Problem of Optimum Distribution of Effort
Abstract: This paper is an extension of previously published work by Bernard O. Koopman to the general case of any number of tasks and any effect function. A systematic method for the numerical calculation of the maximum effect and its corresponding optimum distribution is presented in a form which is also suitable for solution on an automatic digital computer. For the special case of additive returns which saturate, a special graphical or numerical method for any number of tasks is presented with an example worked out in detail. A similar method for multiplicative effects is sketched.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Letter to the Editor---A Family of Queuing Problems
Abstract: Operational situations involving waiting lines differ from each other primarily in the number of service channels available and in the statistics of the service process. Other differences are possible, such as the occurrence of a non-Poisson arrival pattern or the imposition of priorities (A. Cobham, <i>J. Opns. Res. Soc. Am.</i> <b>2</b>, 70 (1954).) but such differences are less frequent. Consequently it appears likely that a two-parameter family of queuing problems, one parameter being the number <i>a</i> of service channels and the other parameter specifying the statistics of the service process, would correspond to most of the waiting-line situations ordinarily encountered.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Strip Mining Phosphate Rock with Large Walking Draglines---A Problem in Operations Research
Abstract: The mining of phosphate rock by strip mining methods is dependent on the effectiveness of a great many managerial decisions which affect the pattern of operations. A mathematical analog was developed to simulate operation of the mining system in such a way as to make possible prediction of the consequences of any alternative decision (in value and cost terms). The results of this study were translated in such a form that they could be applied routinely to the management of mining operations. This study is reported in the three separate phases which the authors believe to characterize the operations-research method (1) formulation of the problem, (2) research and model development, and (3) translation and implementation of results.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Proposal for Revising New York's Subway Fare Structure
Abstract: Consideration of the effect of the fare structure on the efficiency with which transit facilities are utilized leads to the conclusion that operation of a transit system on a self-liquidating or cost-covering basis, either by a private utility company or by a public authority, will inevitably fall considerably short of arriving at an optimum adjustment. Any governmental unit whose finances are in reasonably good shape can materially improve the over-all welfare of its residents by raising the rates of some appropriate taxes and lowering transit fares to a level conducive to more efficient utilization of the transit facilities. The most efficient utilization of the New York subway system requires a fare structure rather drastically different from those now generally in use, and generally at a level which would yield revenues falling considerably short of covering total costs.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Approximate Salvo Kill Probabilities for Small and Medium Sized Targets when Cumulative Damage is Unimportant
Abstract: This paper considers salvo-firing situations where the cumulative damage contribution is unimportant and presents some approximate probability expressions of an analytical nature. These results are valid if the target size and vulnerability are not too large compared to the round dispersion, and the other assumptions adopted are those ordinarily used for problems of this type. These expressions show that, for the two-dimensional situations considered, a salvo kill probability can be approximately stated as an explicit function of four parameters. These parameters are the number of ammunition rounds, the average target vulnerability times the target size, the salvo aiming error dispersion, and a function of the round dispersion and two dispersion type terms which depend on the target size, shape, and vulnerability. Thus the target properties are condensed into three numbers. Also the resulting probability expressions are of a form which permits direct examination of the effects of changes in the salvo-aiming system (fire-control system), the number and properties of the ammunition rounds, and the properties of the target.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Statistical Guide for Accident Research, Illustrated by Application to Non-Air-Carrier Flying, 1949--51
Abstract: Because of lack of information on flying time it is difficult to appraise the statistics published by the C.A.B. on frequencies of accidents of aircraft used in non-air-carrier flying. Comparison of relative frequencies, however, may still be a useful guide in accident research. This paper develops a rating index for this purpose, illustrates its application to six important single-engine aircraft used in non-air-carrier flying in 1949-51, and discusses the difficulties and dangers in the use of the index when applied to aircraft accidents. The technique may be found equally useful in other fields of accident research.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Discussion of Education for Operations Research
Abstract: This paper is based upon discussion which took place during a Symposium on Education for Operations Research which was held in Ithaca in October, 1954. The participants were Dr. Russell L. Ackoff, Case Institute of Technology; Prof. J. G. Brainerd, University of Pennsylvania; Dr. Glen D. Camp, Melpar, Inc.; Dr. W. P Cunningham, U.S. Naval Post Graduate School, Dr. Harold O. Davidson, The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Merrill M. Flood, Columbia University, Dr. Ellis A. Johnson, The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Joseph F. McCloskey, The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. R. E. McGarrah, Cornell University; Dr. Loring G. Mitten, The Ohio State University, Prof. J. E. Morton, Cornell University, Mr. Russell R. O'Neill, University of California, Dr. Edward S. Quade, The Rand Corporation, Dean Robert H. Roy, The Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Melvin Salveson, General Electric Company, Dr. Andrew Schultz, Jr., Cornell University; and Prof. T. M. Whitin, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The transcript of many portions of the discussion is too sketchy to permit direct quotation or publication, and this paper represents a sincere effort to present the opinion of the group where agreement was reached, or the points of disagreement, where the latter seems appropriate. It should be emphasized that the thoughts expressed are based upon the tape and stenographic transcripts available, and cannot be taken to report the full opinion of any individual participant.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Influence of Vehicular Speed and Spacing on Tunnel Capacity
Abstract: In the flow of traffic through vehicular tunnels, it is shown that an approximate linear relationship between speed and density of traffic exists, whereby, as the average speeds of vehicles increase, the density of the traffic stream decreases. The relationship is used to establish a series of theoretical equations that, in turn, permit the determination of optimum conditions of speed and spacing required to produce maximum volumes under given conditions of traffic composition. The significance of uniform speeds and spacings in moving large volumes of traffic, which is disclosed in this study, has been clearly recognized in practice. In the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City, the Port Authority has established minimum speed limits, banned slow under-powered trucks from the tunnel, and erected a number of signs to influence motorists to maintain a specified distance behind preceding vehicles. All of these traffic control devices are directed toward an optimizing of vehicular speeds and spacings, and have resulted in significant increases in maximum hourly traffic volumes accommodated by the tunnel.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Direct Use of Extremal Principles in Solving Certain Optimizing Problems Involving Inequalities
Abstract: It is shown how extremal principles may be used in their rigorous sense to solve certain optimizing problems involving inequalities. The method applies to both linear and non-linear type problems as illustrated by the examples included in the paper, and is particularly suited for electronic digital computation because of the trigger-type, “either-or,” nature of the solution. Certain problems concerned with the low weight design of structures, arising in the author's field of structural mechanics, can be considered to lie in the general field of operations research. Almost invariably these problems contain inequality side conditions and hence may be solved by the methods of the paper.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Mathematical Models for Freely-Flowing Highway Traffic
Abstract: An attempt is made to construct models for the motion of cars on a highway in a manner analogous to the way one treats the motion of molecules in a gas as described by the kinetic theory of gases. In particular the comparison is made between a traffic flow at very low volumes and the motion in a rarefied gas. From this, we are led to expect that even a very crude model of the interaction between individual cars will give a quite reasonable description of the collective behavior of large groups of cars. Some simple estimates of the dependence of average velocity on density and distribution of cars in various lanes of a multilane highway based upon very crude models seem to confirm this expectation.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: The Poisson Distribution as a Limit for Dependent Binomial Events with Unequal Probabilities
Abstract: Many operations-research type problems are concerned with a number of events each of which has two possible outcomes (denoted by, say, “success” and “failure”). Very frequently for these problems the quantity of interest can be stated in terms of the probabilities of specified numbers of “successes” for the group of binomial events considered. The evaluation of these probabilities can be greatly simplified if it is known that they can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. For the special case where each event has the same “success” probability and the events are statistically independent, the binomial probability distribution is applicable. It is well known that the Poisson distribution approximates the binomial distribution if the number of events is large and the probability of “success” is small (see, e.g., Hoel, P. G. 1947. <i>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics</i>. Wiley, 50.). In Koopman [Koopman, B. O. 1950. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Poisson's distribution. <i>Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.</i> <b>1</b> 813--823.] this result was extended to the case of independent binomial events with possibly different probabilities for “success.” This paper presents a further extension in which an event is not required to be statistically independent of all the other events. These results indicate that the Poisson distribution often is applicable to operations-research problems dealing with large numbers of binomial events that have small “success” probabilities.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: On the Numerical Solution of the Transportation Problem
Abstract: The linear transportation problem consists in finding a pattern of shipments between <i>m</i> origins with given surpluses and <i>n</i> destinations with given deficits such that the total cost of transportation is minimized. The method of solution proposed here is iterative and will lead to the optimum in a finite number of steps. It involves finding a good first approximation by simple inspection and improving it by successive adjustments. The earlier stages of the proposed method are less laborious than the simplex method, but the latter has the advantage when the adjustments become more complicated. The proposed method may therefore be used as a starting approach to be followed by the simplex method if the optimum is not reached with simple adjustments only.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Stochastic Properties of Waiting Lines
Abstract: The stochastic properties of waiting lines may be analyzed by a two-stage process: first solving the time-dependent equations for the state probabilities and then utilising these transient solutions to obtain the auto-correlation function for queue length and the root-mean-square frequency spectrum of its fluctuations from mean length. The procedure is worked out in detail for the one-channel, exponential service facility with Poisson arrivals, and the basic solutions for the <i>m</i>-channel exponential service case are given. The analysis indicates that the transient behavior of the queue length <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>) may be measured by a “relaxation time,” the mean time any deviation of <i>n</i>(<i>t</i>) away from its mean value <i>L</i> takes to return (1/<i>e</i>) of the way back to <i>L</i>. This relaxation time increases as (1 - (rho))<sup>-2</sup> as the utilization factor (rho) approaches unity, whereas the mean length <i>L</i> increases as (1 - (rho))<sup>-1</sup>. In other words, as saturation of the facility is approached, the mean length of line increases; but, what is often more detrimental, the length of time for the line to return to average, once it diverges from average, increases even more markedly.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Application of Discrete Variable Servo Theory to Inventory Control
Abstract: Until recently the bases for designing inventory control systems have been poorly understood. This paper discusses the application of discrete variable servo theory to the analysis of inventory control systems, using the simplest periodic inventory replenishment case as an example. The objective is to design an inventory control scheme which will minimize the variance of the inventory balance subject to imposed conditions. A reorder rule is derived and shown to give minimum inventory variance. The “obvious” reorder rule derived is one of several observed in practice in situations approximating the simple case The dependence of the inventory level variance on the sales forecast error and system constants is stated explicitly. The principles and methods illustrated are applicable to more complex types of discrete control systems.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Production Scheduling for an Arbitrary Number of Periods Given the Sales Forecast in the form of a Probability Distribution
Abstract: In this paper a mathematical model is presented for solving an optimum production scheduling problem. The optimum program is not dependent on the sale price as long as the production is forced to fulfill all the sales orders. The sales forecast is given in the form of a probability distribution for a number of periods. The costs consist of ordinary production costs, overtime production costs, and costs for carrying inventory. The importance of a unique policy for the calculation of the program is pointed out. Three different policies have been treated (1) scheduling for one period each time, (2) scheduling over two periods every second period, and (3) scheduling over as many periods as the enterprise is expected to last. The three different policies give different optimal programs. A numerical example has been carried out analytically where the differences are shown. Policy (1) above gives the lowest cost because all information about the inventories is known at the beginning of each of the periods.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Letter to the Editor---“Such Solutions are Very Little Solved”
Abstract: The May, 1955, issue of JORSA carried two articles which seem to call for comment---one, a serious article by Bertram Klein entitled “Direct Use of Extremal Principles in Solving Certain Optimizing Problems Involving Inequalities” and two, a short, humorous one by Paul Gunther entitled “Use of Linear Programming in Capital Budgeting.” We believe that readers of JORSA will be well advised to treat the humorous article seriously and the serious article humorously.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: An Analog Solution of Programming Problems
Abstract: A simple, fast, and accurate method for solving (static) programming problems is presented. The method is particularly well adapted to electronic analog computers. The problem is interpreted as the asymptotic solution of a problem in the dynamics of a massless particle. The “particle” is considered to move in <i>n</i>-space away from those regions forbidden by the constraints of the problem and toward optimization of the criterion function. Constraint or criterion functions need not be linear but merely expressible with available computer components. The speed with which a solution is attained is under the operator's control.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Applications of Game Theory in Fighter Versus Bomber Combat
Abstract: The theory of games offers a valuable framework in which to evaluate future or proposed weapons systems. These evaluations are generally based upon the computed performance of the various weapons systems in a typical combat situation. The computation of this performance invariably involves the specification of certain tactics which are relatively easy to change by either combatant. It is reasonable to assume that these combatants would be “rational” in the game-theoretic sense.Although the specific type of weapons systems discussed here are those of individual aircraft, the concepts are directly applicable to other systems. However, for clarity of exposition we shall not refer to any of these generalizations.This paper was prepared for, and portions were presented at the First Annual Meeting of the Operations Research Society in Cleveland, Ohio, May 16, 1953.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: On a Congestion Problem in an Aircraft Factory
Abstract: This is a study of the optimum number of clerks to be placed behind service counters. It involves queuing theory and was solved in two parts: First, we considered the counter from the customers' side, the “obverse” queue. Observational data showed that arrivals at the counter occur at random, the order of serving was random, and the distribution of the service times was exponential, so that Erlang's “C” formula for the probability that a customer has to wait applied. A formula is derived and graphed that shows the optimum number of clerks to be used behind the counter and the over-all minimum cost caused by waiting on the part of the customers and the clerks as a function of the queue input and the ratio of the cost of the customers' time to that of the clerks'. Second, the queue from the clerks' side was considered, that is, from the “reverse” queue. Clerks' time spent waiting for customers to appear is not altogether lost, if they can do work behind the counter. What happens to the clerks is governed by the characteristics of the “obverse” queue. From that is derived the probability distribution of the clerks' waiting time, considering the clerks to form a queue, as customers do. With this we calculate the saving in clerks' time that can be effected subject to the limitations of the shortest free period and the total length of time that can be used productively. This saving can then be subtracted from the cost computed in the first part of the study. The results obtained are applicable to any queuing operation which has the same characteristics.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: A Non-Numerical Approach to Production Scheduling Problems
Abstract: In a typical production scheduling problem, <i>n</i> parts must be fabricated using <i>m</i> machines, and each part must be fabricated in a given order on the machines. It is desired to schedule the parts so that the program is optimal with respect to some given criteria. In general, (<i>n</i>!)<sup><i>m</i></sup> programs must be examined. To obtain the ultimate solution, it is necessary to know for each part its actual time of fabrication on each machine. However, it is shown that without consideration of numerical values, it is possible to eliminate initially a great number of the possible programs by purely non-numerical methods.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Determination of the Maximal Steady State Flow of Traffic Through a Railroad Network
Abstract: A simple and rapid method of estimating the maximal steady state flow of traffic through a railway network is described and illustrated by examples The method, as presently described, is entirely empirical in character and no generality is claimed. Essentially, it is an illustration of the application of the techniques of gaming to certain classes of mathematical problems. This study is an outcome of a suggestion by General F. S. Ross (U.S.A., Ret.), T. E. Harris, and others, and it has been prepared as a contribution to their much broader project.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: An Appreciation of Systems Analysis
Abstract: Military systems analysis is an extension of operations-research techniques of World War II to problems of broader context and longer range---e.g., force composition and development as well as operations decisions. Greater complexity is inevitable as we attempt analyses to aid decisions affecting more distant time periods: growth in number of relevant variables, compounding of uncertainties; increased importance of enemy reactions; complications of time phasing, the need for a broader concept of criteria Techniques available to the systems analyst for dealing with these complexities are less than satisfactory. “Factoring” is inevitable. All routine or mechanistic approaches are deficient; e.g., expected value and minimax criteria. Design and criteria problems are of dominant importance. The systems analyst may have to be content with better rather than optimal solutions, or with devising and costing sensible methods of hedging; or merely with discovering critical sensitivities. He has an important role as inventor of systems. The difficulties of systems analysis are rooted in the nature of the military problems. Other methods---e.g, piecemeal analysis or intuition---do not escape them and have limitations of their own. Military systems analysis provides a framework for combining the knowledge of experts in many fields to reach solutions which transcend any individual expert's judgment.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Expectancy of Multiple Vehicular Breakdowns in a Tunnel
Abstract: One of the principal operating problems at vehicular tunnels is that of traffic stoppages resulting from disabled vehicles. These vehicles break down for such various reasons as flat tires, overheating, no gasoline, and mechanical failures. The stoppages are particularly troublesome in peak traffic periods when the full capacity of the tunnel may be badly needed. Subaqueous tunnels consist of two-lane tubes, so that a stoppage in one lane immediately reduces the capacity of the tube affected by one-half. Actually, the reduction in capacity is even greater than one-half, since the movement of traffic in the unstopped lane is reduced by the operations necessary to remove the disabled vehicle.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.

Title: Engineering Studies of Urban Traffic Flow
Abstract: The one thing that a traffic engineer learns early in life is that, no matter how many statistics or how many studies he makes, he never can come up with an answer that will completely satisfy everyone. Naturally, no traffic improvement can be made without changing people's habits, without eliminating some special privileges, and, in some cases, without actually hurting people---from a business standpoint. However, if his plans are based on good, sound data, the average traffic engineer can support his program before the public or, if necessary, in our courts.<i>Operations Research</i>, ISSN 0030-364X, was published as <i>Journal of the Operations Research Society of America</i> from 1952 to 1955 under ISSN 0096-3984.
