Title: Identity, Morals, and Taboos: Beliefs as Assets 
Abstract:
 We develop a theory of moral behavior, individual and collective, based on
 a general model of identity in which people care about "who they are" and
 infer their own values from past choices. The model sheds light on many
 empirical puzzles inconsistent with earlier approaches. Identity
 investments respond nonmonotonically to acts or threats, and taboos on
 mere thoughts arise to protect beliefs about the "priceless" value of
 certain social assets. High endowments trigger escalating commitment and a
 treadmill effect, while competing identities can cause dysfunctional
 capital destruction. Social interactions induce both social and antisocial
 norms of contribution, sustained by respectively shunning free riders or
 do-gooders.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Home Computer Use and the Development of Human Capital 
Abstract:
 This paper uses a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect
 of home computers on child and adolescent outcomes by exploiting a voucher
 program in Romania. Our main results indicate that home computers have
 both positive and negative effects on the development of human capital.
 Children who won a voucher to purchase a computer had significantly lower
 school grades but show improved computer skills. There is also some
 evidence that winning a voucher increased cognitive skills, as measured by
 Raven's Progressive Matrices. We do not find much evidence for an effect
 on non-cognitive outcomes. Parental rules regarding homework and computer
 use attenuate the effects of computer ownership, suggesting that parental
 monitoring and supervision may be important mediating factors.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Potato's Contribution to Population and Urbanization: Evidence From A Historical Experiment 
Abstract:
 We exploit regional variation in suitability for cultivating potatoes,
 together with time variation arising from their introduction to the Old
 World from the Americas, to estimate the impact of potatoes on Old World
 population and urbanization. Our results show that the introduction of the
 potato was responsible for a significant portion of the increase in
 population and urbanization observed during the eighteenth and nineteenth
 centuries. According to our most conservative estimates, the introduction
 of the potato accounts for approximately one-quarter of the growth in Old
 World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900. Additional
 evidence from within-country comparisons of city populations and adult
 heights also confirms the cross-country findings.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Immigration, Skill Mix, and Capital Skill Complementarity 
Abstract:
 Over the past thirty years, U.S. manufacturing plants invested heavily in
 automation machinery. This paper shows these investments substituted for
 the least-skilled workers and complemented middle-skilled workers at
 equipment and fabricated metal plants. Specifically, it exploits the fact
 that some metropolitan areas experienced faster growth in the relative
 supply of less-skilled labor in the 1980s and 1990s due to an immigration
 wave and the tendency of immigrants to regionally cluster. Plants in these
 areas adopted significantly less machinery per unit output, despite having
 similar adoption plans initially. The results imply that fixed rental
 rates for automation machinery reduce the effect that immigration has on
 less-skilled relative wages.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Fear of Fire Sales, Illiquidity Seeking, and Credit Freezes 
Abstract:
 Is there any need to clean up a banking system by closing some banks and
 forcing others to sell assets if the risk of a crisis becomes high?
 Impaired banks that may be forced to sell illiquid assets in the future
 have private incentives to hold, rather than sell, those assets
 Anticipating a potential fire sale, liquid buyers expect high returns,
 reducing their incentive to lend. Privately optimal trading decisions
 therefore lead to a worse fire sale and a larger drop in lending than is
 necessary. We discuss alternative ways of cleaning up the system and the
 associated costs and benefits.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Adjustment Costs, Firm Responses, and Micro vs. Macro Labor Supply Elasticities: Evidence from Danish Tax Records 
Abstract:
 We show that the effects of taxes on labor supply are shaped by
 interactions between adjustment costs for workers and hours constraints
 set by firms. We develop a model in which firms post job offers
 characterized by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find
 jobs. We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by
 analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger kinks
 generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks that apply to a
 larger group of workers generate larger elasticities. Third, the
 distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers' aggregate tax
 preferences in equilibrium. Our results suggest that macro elasticities
 may be substantially larger than the estimates obtained using standard
 microeconometric methods.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Learning Self-Control 
Abstract:
 This article examines how a decision maker who is only partially aware of
 his temptations learns about them over time. In facing temptations,
 individuals use their experience to forecast future self-control problems
 and choose the appropriate level of commitment. I demonstrate that
 rational learning can be perpetually partial and need not result in full
 sophistication. The main result of this article characterizes necessary
 and sufficient conditions for learning to converge to full sophistication.
 I apply this result to a consumption-savings environment in which a
 decision maker is tempted by present bias and establish a
 learning-theoretic justification for assuming sophistication in this
 setting.<disp-quote>"An individual who finds himself continuously
 repudiating his past plans may learn to distrust his future behavior, and
 may do something about it." -- </disp-quote>  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Growth in the Shadow of Expropriation 
Abstract:
 We propose a tractable variant of the open economy neoclassical growth
 model that emphasizes political economy and contracting frictions. The
 political economy frictions involve a preference for immediate spending,
 while the contracting friction is a lack of commitment regarding foreign
 debt and expropriation. We show that the political economy frictions slow
 an economy's convergence to the steady state due to the endogenous
 evolution of capital taxation. The model rationalizes why openness has
 different implications for growth depending on the political environment,
 why institutions such as the treatment of capital income evolve over time,
 why governments in countries that grow rapidly accumulate net foreign
 assets rather than liabilities, and why foreign aid may not affect growth.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Legislative Bargaining with Reconsideration 
Abstract:
 We present a dynamic model of legislative bargaining with an endogenously
 evolving default policy and a persistent agenda setter. Policy making
 proceeds until the agenda setter can no longer pass a new policy to
 replace an approved bill. We prove existence and necessary conditions of
 pure-strategy stationary equilibria for any finite policy space, any
 number of players, and any preference profile. In equilibrium, the value
 of proposal power is limited compared to the case that disallows
 reconsideration, as voters are induced to protect each other's benefits to
 maintain their future bargaining positions. The agenda setter, in turn,
 would prefer to limit his ability to reconsider. The lack of commitment
 due to the possibility of reconsideration, however, enhances policy
 efficiency.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Accountability and Flexibility in Public Schools: Evidence from Boston's Charters And Pilots 
Abstract:
 We use student assignment lotteries to estimate the effect of charter
 school attendance on student achievement in Boston. We also evaluate a
 related alternative, Boston's pilot schools. Pilot schools have some of
 the independence of charter schools but are in the Boston Public School
 district and are covered by some collective bargaining provisions. Lottery
 estimates show large and significant score gains for charter students in
 middle and high school. In contrast, lottery estimates for pilot school
 students are mostly small and insignificant, with some significant
 negative effects. Charter schools with binding assignment lotteries appear
 to generate larger gains than other charters.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.

Title: Social Structure and Development: A Legacy of the Holocaust in Russia 
Abstract:
 We document a statistical association between the severity of the
 persecution, displacement and mass murder of Jews by the Nazis during
 World War II and long-run economic and political outcomes within Russia.
 Cities that experienced the Holocaust most intensely have grown less, and
 both cities and administrative districts (oblasts) where the Holocaust had
 the largest impact have worse economic and political outcomes since the
 collapse of the Soviet Union. We provide evidence that the lasting impact
 of the Holocaust may be attributable to a permanent change it induced in
 the social structure across different regions of Russia.  Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press.
