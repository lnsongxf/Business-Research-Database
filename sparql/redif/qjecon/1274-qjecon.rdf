Title: Reshaping Institutions: Evidence on Aid Impacts Using a Preanalysis Plan 
Abstract:
 Despite their importance, there is limited evidence on how institutions
 can be strengthened. Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is
 complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the
 difficulty of measuring institutional performance, and the temptation to
 "cherry pick" estimates from among the large number of indicators required
 to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt to make
 local institutions more democratic and egalitarian by imposing
 participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and
 test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assignment of a
 governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world outcome
 measures, and use a preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands against data
 mining. The intervention studied is a "community-driven development"
 program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign aid donors. We
 find positive short-run effects on local public goods and economic
 outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective action,
 decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups, suggesting
 that the intervention did not durably reshape local institutions. We
 discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing a PAP and show how
 in its absence we could have generated two divergent, equally erroneous
 interpretations of program impacts on institutions. JEL Codes: F35, H41,

Title: The Organization of Firms Across Countries 
Abstract:
 We argue that social capital as proxied by trust increases aggregate
 productivity by affecting the organization of firms. To do this we collect
 new data on the decentralization of investment, hiring, production, and
 sales decisions from corporate headquarters to local plant managers in
 almost 4,000 firms in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We find that
 firms headquartered in high-trust regions are significantly more likely to
 decentralize. To help identify causal effects, we look within
 multinational firms and show that higher levels of bilateral trust between
 the multinational's country of origin and subsidiary's country of location
 increases decentralization, even after instrumenting trust using religious
 similarities between the countries. Finally, we show evidence suggesting
 that trust raises aggregate productivity by facilitating reallocation
 between firms and allowing more efficient firms to grow, as CEOs can
 decentralize more decisions.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Dynamic Games with Asymmetric Information: A Framework for Empirical Work 
Abstract:
 We develop a framework for the analysis of dynamic oligopolies with
 persistant sources of asymmetric information that enables applied analysis
 of situations of empirical importance that have been difficult to deal
 with. The framework generates policies that are "relatively" easy for
 agents to use while still being optimal in a meaningful sense, and is
 amenable to empirical research in that its equilibrium conditions can be
 tested and equilibrium policies are relatively easy to compute. We
 conclude with an example that endogenizes the maintenance decisions of
 electricity generators when the costs states of the generators are private
 information.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Subgame-Perfect Implementation Under Information Perturbations 
Abstract:
 We consider the robustness of extensive form mechanisms to deviations from
 common knowledge about the state of nature, which we refer to as
 information perturbations. First, we show that even under arbitrarily
 small information perturbations the Moore-Repullo mechanism does not yield
 (even approximately) truthful revelation and that in addition the
 mechanism has sequential equilibria with undesirable outcomes. More
 generally, we prove that any extensive form mechanism is fragile in the
 sense that if a non-Maskin monotonic social objective can be implemented
 with this mechanism, then there are arbitrarily small information
 perturbations under which an undesirable sequential equilibrium also
 exists. Finally, we argue that outside options can help improve efficiency
 in asymmetric information environments, and that these options can be
 thought of as reflecting ownership of an asset. JEL Codes: C72, D23, D78,

Title: Hatred and Profits: Under the Hood of the Ku Klux Klan 
Abstract:
 In this article, we analyze the 1920s Ku Klux Klan, those who joined it,
 and its social and political impact by combining a wide range of archival
 data sources with data from the 1920 and 1930 U.S censuses. We find that
 individuals who joined the Klan in some cities were more educated and more
 likely to hold professional jobs than the typical American. Surprisingly,
 we find little evidence that the Klan had an effect on black or
 foreign-born residential mobility or vote totals. Rather than a terrorist
 organization, the 1920s Klan is best described as social organization with
 a very successful multilevel marketing structure fueled by an army of
 highly incentivized sales agents selling hatred, religious intolerance,
 and fraternity in a time and place where there was tremendous demand. JEL

Title: Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Finance Industry: 1909--2006 
Abstract:
 We study the allocation and compensation of human capital in the U.S.
 finance industry over the past century. Across time, space, and
 subsectors, we find that financial deregulation is associated with skill
 intensity, job complexity, and high wages for finance employees. All three
 measures are high before 1940 and after 1985, but not in the interim
 period. Workers in finance earn the same education-adjusted wages as other
 workers until 1990, but by 2006 the premium is 50% on average. Top
 executive compensation in finance follows the same pattern and timing,
 where the premium reaches 250%. Similar results hold for other top earners
 in finance. Changes in earnings risk can explain about one half of the
 increase in the average premium; changes in the size distribution of firms
 can explain about one fifth of the premium for executives.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Reputation with Analogical Reasoning 
Abstract:
 We consider a repeated interaction between a long-run player and a
 sequence of short-run players, in which the long-run player may either be
 rational or may be a mechanical type who plays the same (possibly mixed)
 action in every stage game. We depart from the classical model in assuming
 that the short-run players make inferences by analogical reasoning,
 meaning that they correctly identify the average strategy of each type of
 long-run player, but do not recognize how this play varies across
 histories. Concentrating on 2 &times; 2 games, we provide a
 characterization of equilibrium payoffs, establishing a payoff bound for
 the rational long-run player that can be strictly larger than the familiar
 "Stackelberg" bound. We also provide a characterization of equilibrium
 behavior, showing that play begins with either a reputation-building or a
 reputation-spending stage (depending on parameters), followed by a
 reputation-manipulation stage.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Market Power Screens Willingness-to-Pay 
Abstract:
 What is the best way to reward innovation? While prizes avoid deadweight
 loss, intellectual property (IP) selects high social surplus projects.
 Optimal innovation policy thus trades off the ex ante screening benefit
 and the ex post distortion. It solves a multidimensional screening problem
 in the private information held by the innovator: research cost, quality,
 and market size of the innovation. The appropriate degree of market power
 is never full monopoly pricing and is determined by measurable market
 characteristics, the inequality and elasticity of innovation supply,
 making the analysis open to empirical calibration. The framework has
 applications beyond IP policy to the optimal pricing of platforms or the
 optimal procurement of public infrastructure.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: Organization and Information: Firms' Governance Choices in Rational-Expectations Equilibrium 
Abstract:
 We analyze a rational-expectations model of price formation in an
 intermediate-good market under uncertainty. There is a continuum of firms,
 each consisting of a party who can reduce production cost and a party who
 can discover information about demand. Both parties can make specific
 investments at private cost, and there is a machine that either party can
 control. As in incomplete-contracting models, different governance
 structures (i.e., different allocations of control of the machine) create
 different incentives for the parties' investments. As in
 rational-expectations models, some parties may invest in acquiring
 information, which is then incorporated into the market-clearing price of
 the intermediate good by these parties' production decisions. The
 informativeness of the price mechanism affects the returns to specific
 investments and hence the optimal governance structure for individual
 firms; meanwhile, the governance choices by individual firms affect the
 informativeness of the price mechanism. In equilibrium, the
 informativeness of the price mechanism can induce ex ante homogeneous
 firms to choose heterogeneous governance structures.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.

Title: The Political Economy of Deforestation in the Tropics 
Abstract:
 Tropical deforestation accounts for almost one-fifth of greenhouse gas
 emissions and threatens the world's most diverse ecosystems. Much of this
 deforestation is driven by illegal logging. We use novel satellite data
 that tracks annual deforestation across eight years of Indonesian
 institutional change to examine how local officials' incentives affect
 deforestation. Increases in the number of political jurisdictions lead to
 increased deforestation and lower timber prices, consistent with Cournot
 competition between jurisdictions. Illegal logging and local oil and gas
 rents are short-run substitutes, but this effect disappears over time with
 political turnover. The results illustrate how local officials' incentives
 affect deforestation and show how standard economic theories can explain
 illegal behavior.  Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.
