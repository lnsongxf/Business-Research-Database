Title: Statistical Analyses and the "Laws" of Price
Abstract: Economists have been skeptical as to the real significance of statistical price analyses. Simplified assumptions as to nature of price determination are partly responsible, 201. — Marshall's treatment was nearer to the concrete facts, 202. — Definition of the market in time and space has an important bearing upon the meaning of the data, 203. — Actual events represent constant flux, not successive static periods, 203. — Statistics can reveal only current adjustments, not final equilibria, 203. — The type of the adjustment varies with the length of the period, 204. — The prices which directly affect production and consumption are frequently not the central market prices, 205; and non-economic factors also are involved, 206. — A curve of supply-and-price may be determined from observations in successive intervals, 207; even if demand is changing, 208. — The curve of supply-and-price is not the theoretical demand curve, 214; since reservation demands by producers may be regarded either as a demand-schedule or a supply-schedule, 215. — With regard to a price fixed by total supply, reservation demands are part of the demand schedule, 215. — But this schedule may be resolved into its components by proper statistical analyses, 216. — This involves determination (a) of the effect of price upon supply, and (b) of the effect of price upon storage, consumption, and withholdings, 217. — Price also has an effect upon subsequent production, 219. — Such changes in production are usually more important than immediate adjustments of supply to price, 220. — This is true even of durable goods, 221. — Statistical measurement of the effect of price upon production illustrated, 222. — Statistical measurements of economic reactions do not yield absolute laws, 223. — This analysis refutes some previous criticisms of the logic of statistical price studies, 224, and of the methods, 225; and indicates the statistical cautions needed to give reliable results, 226.

Abstract: The problem and its relation to the supply and demand control of rates of exchange involving future goods, — I. Comparative values of futures and spots in relation to available supplies from crops, 368. — A future trade is an exchange of future money for a future commodity, and does not involve present goods, 370. — II. Indications of a downward bias in grain and cotton futures call for explanation, 372. — III. Bohm-Bawerk's theory of a discount on the future is quite another matter, 375. — IV. But a difference in the relative valuation of money and any specific commodity may be expected according to whether the comparison pertains to the present or to the future, 377. — This situation as expressed in terms of mathematical inequalities, 379. — V. Commercial experience and observation of the comparative value of "immediates," 379. — The downward bias costly to hedge sellers, 383. — VI.

Title: The Sherman ActIts Design and Its Effects 
Abstract: Purpose of Sherman Act, — Diverse interests affected, 5. — I. Producer interests: indirectly protected by (a) raising standards of managerial responsibility, (b) affording various classes of producers the opportunity for prudential cooperation, 8. — Inadequacy of security afforded producers under Sherman Act, 14. — II. Interests of potential producers, 15; directly protected against (a) predatory methods of competition, 19, (b) trade boycotts, 20, (c) labor conspiracies to restrict sales and employer combinations to blacklist, 21. — Evidence of rigorous effectiveness of Sherman Act in safeguarding freedom of enterprise, 21. — III. Consumer interests: directly protected by penalization of concerted efforts to curtail supply or raise prices, (a) Trade agreements for these objects absolutely illegal, 24, but trade coöperation to control conditions of competition not hindered, 26. (b) Corporate mergers, originally held beyond the reach of the law, were later, so it appeared, absolutely condemned, 31. Present interpretation more liberal, 36. — Is there justification for a legal distinction between business mergers and associations? 38. — IV. Conclusion, that experience has vindicated the general policy of the Sherman Act, 39. — Contrast with British experience, 40. — Direction in which anti-trust laws need to be supplemented, 43.

Title: Water and the Course of Empire in North Africa
Abstract: I. The Rise and Fall of Material Culture. Population, cultivated area, and wealth have swelled and dwindled almost rhythmically for thousands of years — the moving frontier of settled agriculture. — II. Rainfall and Cultivated Area. Relation of topography to rainfall and cost of transport by zones, 48. — Significance of the alternate fallow year, 53. — Cereal and olive production the one index of economic development applicable to all periods, 54. — Extent of the economically valuable area. The change since ancient times has been economic, not geographic, 56. — III. Irrigation. Irrigation important, not so much for itself as because of its effects upon the dry-farming area. Evidence from ruins that climate has not basically changed, 58. — Ancient and modern dry-farming similar, 60. — Limited resources of North Africa in irrigation water, 65. — IV. Soil Exhaustion. Soil exhaustion rather an effect or accompaniment of economic decay than a cause, 68. — Some damage from erosion and deforestation, but this less important than commercial, social, and technical changes, 70. — V. Population and its Economic Basis. Growth of Algerian population during the past century. Professor Pearl over emphasizes war-losses, under emphasizes drought periods; but his results are extremely significant, 71. — Algeria a liability to France during the first half-century of fumbling. Followed by a half-century of progress under policies built upon knowledge of North African geography, 74. — VI. The Economics of Empire. Agricultural and administrative policies under which North Africa has prospered roughly similar in all ages, but the differences in detail are important, 79. — "Arabization" has been mainly social and economic, not biological, 82. — Economic significance of Roman and modern frontiers: the camel, the railway, and the motorcar, 83. — "Environmental resistance," 85. — Can North Africa be a self-supporting or self-governing economic unit? 86. — The benefits of "imperialism," 87.
