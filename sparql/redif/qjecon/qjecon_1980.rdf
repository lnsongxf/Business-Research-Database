Title: A Model of the London Coal Trade in the Eighteenth Century
Abstract: By the eighteenth century Newcastle coal was the primary source of fuel for London. Two major characteristics of the trade were periodic attempts at cartelization by producers and the existence of a substantial per unit tax on the commodity. In order to measure the relative quantitative impact of market structure and tax policy, a linear supply and demand model is estimated using two-stage least squares. The major arguments of the paper are that the cartels were ineffective in restricting supply, that the tax on coal raised its price significantly, and that final consumers bore the greatest share of the tax burden. Upon the cheap and regular acquisition of fossile fuel, our national improvement and prosperity eminently depends. Robert Edington An Essay on the Coal Trade (1803, 7).

Title: Trade Hedging and the Dynamic Stability of the Foreign Exchange Market
Abstract: This paper uses a simple difference equation model to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the foreign exchange market under a regime of flexible exchange rates. It is shown that unhedged trade transactions can produce a dynamically unstable market, particularly if contracts are denominated in the seller's currency. We then examine the influence of trade hedging, using either the forward market or an artificial currency unit, and find that it considerably enhances the overall likelihood of stability.

Title: Neoclassical Theory and the Optimizing Peasant: An Econometric Analysis of Market Family Labor Supply in a Developing Country
Abstract: Few attempts have been made to test empirically the multitude of models formulated to describe household labor supply behavior in the context of rural labor markets in developing countries. In this paper refutable predictions are derived from a neoclassical multi-person household model based on competitive assumptions modified to take into account differences in landholding status. A national sample survey of rural households from India is used to estimate the parameters of the model for male and female agricultural workers from farm and nonfarm households. The estimates generally conform to the implications of the neoclassical-competitive framework.

Title: Estimating the Economic Model of Crime With Individual Data
Abstract: The paper develops a variant of the economic model of crime. The model developed is estimated using information on the post-release activities of a sample of men released from the North Carolina prison system. Both the expected certainty and severity of punishment are found to deter criminal activity in a number of instances and a 1 percent increase in certainty is generally found to have a greater effect than a similar increase in severity. Certainty of punishment is found to have a greater effect for relatively minor offenders and severity for persons offenders. While higher legal wages are found to deter, their effect is quite weak.

Title: The Object Distribution Problem Revisited
Abstract: The object distribution problem calls for a number of indivisible objects to be assigned to a set of individuals (e.g., the division of estate properties among heirs). Some thirty years ago Knaster and Steinhaus presented a distribution scheme based upon object values reported by individuals. The properties of this scheme are examined, and it is shown that the K-S procedure is the only scheme that satisfies a number of plausible equity requirements.

Title: Monopoly and the Intertemporal Production of a Durable Extractable Resource
Abstract: In extractive industries producing a resource that does not quickly wear out, monopoly power has an important effect on the rate of production, and hence on the pattern of prices, over time. In many cases, a monopoly producer of a durable resource will rationally choose a high initial price, and lower that price over time; this contrasts dramatically with the strategy of a competitive extractive industry, which optimally increases price over time at the industry's discount rate, regardless of the durability of the resource. In the cases we study, it is found that a monopoly producer of a durable resource will be more conservation-minded than will a competitive industry, initially producing at a slower rate in order to keep early-period prices high.

Title: Equalizing Differences in the Labor Market
Abstract: The theory of equalizing differences asserts that workers receive compensating wage premiums when they accept jobs with undesirable nonwage characteristics, holding the worker's characteristics constant. Previous research provides only inconsistent support for the theory, with wrong-signed or insignificant estimates of these wage premiums fairly common. An oft-cited reason for these anomalies is that important characteristics of the worker remain unmeasured, biasing the estimates. In this paper, longitudinal data are used to test this conjecture. Although such data improve the control for worker characteristics, the plausibility of the estimates is not markedly improved. Alternative explanations for these results are considered.

Title: Price-Cost Margins and Successive Market Power
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact on an industry's price-cost margin of firms in downstream industries having seller market power. We develop a detailed theoretical model based upon Cournot's work in this area which predicts that margins are raised by an increase in successive market power of this type. Our prediction contrasts with work by Lustgarten, who found that bilateral market power depressed margins; we explain our result intuitively in terms of two opposing effects. In our regression analysis on U. K. data we test the two hypotheses simultaneously and find both confirmed.

Title: The Determination of Optimum Buffer Stock Intervention Rules
Abstract: It has been established for some time in the case of linear supply and demand curves that are subject to parallel stochastic shift factors that the joint welfare of trading partners measured as the sum of consumers' and producers' surpluses is increased by a reduction of price instability. This paper seeks to combine this result with information on the costs of buffer stock schemes to establish the optimum degree of price stabilization. The maximization of the partners' joint expected net benefit yields an optimum intervention price range that will vary with demand and supply elasticities, and other market conditions.

Title: Another Look at Liquidity Preference
Abstract: This paper shows that a "precautionary" demand for money can be derived in models of the state of nature variety with uncertain cash requirements even if sales of assets incur no real costs and investors are risk-neutral. The randomness of asset prices results from uncertainty about the future state of the world that determines cash requirements, hence particular market responses and ultimately equilibrium prices. Positive correlation between the amount of assets to be liquidated and the liquidation price is a sufficient condition for the derivation of an interest-elastic demand for liquidity. The correlation coefficient is a "measure of illiquidity" of a perfectly marketable asset. Interesting comparative static results are also derived.

Title: Monopoly and the Distribution of Wealth: A Reappraisal
Abstract: In a recent article William Comanor and Robert Smiley [1975] attempt assessment of the impact of multi-industry monopoly on the personal distribution of wealth in the United States. The conclusions of their study are striking: possibly one-half of existing wealth holdings by the richest 2.4 percent of American households is due entirely to capitalized monopoly gains. Yet the methods by which this and similar estimates are obtained suffer from certain difficulties: first with regard to the theoretical framework implicit in the estimation procedure, and second with regard to several parameters used in the application of this framework. The following two sections, respectively, present these difficulties.

Title: Employer-Employee Interaction and the Duration of Unemployment
Abstract: This paper identifies three alternative approaches to the duration of unemployment—the screening, the formal search theory, and the intensity of search approaches. From these approaches, a unified model of the weekly probability of leaving unemployment (WPOLU) is developed. In this model, WPOLU is the product of the weekly probability of job vacancy location, the probability of offer extension, and the probability of offer acceptance. The determinants of these probabilities are analyzed. The model is tested with data from the 1970 Census Employment Survey. Evidence supporting all three approaches is found. An eclectic view of unemployment is called for.

Title: Takeovers, Shareholder Returns, and the Theory of the Firm
Abstract: The paper examines recent merger and takeover activity in the United Kingdom. Specifically, the impact of takeovers on shareholder returns and management benefits is analyzed, and some implications for the theory of the firm are drawn from the results. The research showed that mergers and takeovers resulted in benefits to the acquired firms' shareholders and to the acquiring companies' managers, but that losses were suffered by the acquiring companies' shareholders. The results are consistent with takeovers being motivated more by maximization of management utility reasons, than by the maximization of shareholder wealth.

Title: A Theory of Legislative Organization: Making the Most of Your Majority
Abstract: In this paper we seek to explain why legislative committees exist and what is the optimal number and size of committees in a legislature. Our theory is based on the idea that committees are a "sample" taken from the full house and on the assumption that the majority party seeks to maximize the proportion of its favored bills which are reviewed and passed in voting trials. We show that for a given size of majority fewer and larger committees lead to larger passage rates, if majority members do not always vote the party-line.

Title: Cooperative Farming in North China
Abstract: A simple linear programming framework is used to simulate various forms of cooperation between representative farms of two villages in prewar China. The results suggest that even though the two farms individually were quite efficient revenue maximizers, significant mutual benefit would result from the formation of an elementary agricultural producers' cooperative. A move to an advanced cooperative in which dividend payments for land brought into the cooperative initially would be eliminated and income distributed solely according to labor contribution, however, would meet with strong resistance because a sizeable income loss would be involved for the farm with the larger initial land endowment.

Title: Primogeniture, Equal Sharing, and the U.S. Distribution of Wealth
Abstract: Bequest patterns to children are important in intergenerational models of the distribution of income and wealth. Economies that feature primogeniture will have a greater degree of inequality than those featuring equal division. This paper presents evidence on estate division among children by sex, birth order, family size, estate size, and asset composition. The results presented here are preference-generated not tax-induced due to the tax characteristics within the sampling region. It is shown that equal sharing among children is the rule, a result that casts doubt upon the "altruist" model of inheritance as advanced by Becker and Tomes.

Title: Futures Markets and the Theory of the Firm under Price Uncertainty
Abstract: This paper examines the behavior of a competitive firm under price uncertainty where a futures market exists for the commodity produced by the firm. Working with the Sandmo approach, we found that production decisions depend only on the futures market price and input costs; the subjective distribution of future spot price affects only the firm's involvement in futures trading. Conditions are then determined under which a firm will either hedge, speculate by buying futures contracts, or speculate by selling futures contracts. The results indicate that an important social benefit derived from the existence of a futures market is to eliminate output fluctuations due to variation in producers' subjective distributions of future spot price.

Title: Spatial Pricing Patterns in the United States
Abstract: This paper is an empirical extension of spatial price theory with results being established by selected statistical approaches, namely multiple linear regression and Chow's test. The locational pattern of competitors as well as varying intensities of competition at different spatial market points are found to play dominant roles in determining the pricing patterns of American firms. Differences in the price practices of firms of different states are identified, and price discrimination over geographic space is found to be the most prevalent pricing technique.

Title: Taxation and Corporate Financial Policy
Abstract: A model of corporate financial policy (debt-equity ratios and dividend payout rates) is included in the Harberger general equilibrium model of incidence of the corporate income tax. Illustrative calculations of the distortions of financial policy and increases in risk premiums induced by the corporate tax are provided. Because risk premiums on corporate securities would be reduced, eliminating the corporate tax or integrating it into the personal tax would increase the income of noncorporate investors relatively more than that of investors in corporate securities, and is therefore less regressive than is commonly thought.

Title: The Economic Value of Changing Mortality Probabilities: A Decision-Theoretic Approach
Abstract: Properties of individual willingness to pay for changes in mortality probabilities are examined using a decision-theoretic model. There is no unique value per life saved. The willingness to pay for a mortality reduction depends not only on the amount of reduction but also on the initial probability level and on whether the valuation is ex ante (e.g., decisions regarding health insurance, preventive medicine, or environmental health) or ex post (e.g., acute medical care). Several inequalities relating the imputed willingness to pay in various paradigm decision contexts are derived from the model with the addition of few additional behavioral assumptions.

Title: Demand Growth, Profitability, and Entry
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to elucidate on the effect of demand growth on the competitive structure of an industry. We describe the effects of growth of market demand on concentration, barriers to entry, and the rate of return on capital. To illustrate these effects, we examine the behavior of an established firm in a fast growing industry, formulating an entry decision model of a potential firm. Our model lends support to the view that the increase in the growth rate of demand increases the dominant firm's profit rate, but decreases its market share.

Title: Systematic Risk and the Theory of the Firm
Abstract: The mean-variance capital-asset-pricing model forms the basis for much of the theoretical and empirical work in modern financial economics. While this model defines the relevant measure of the risk of a security β in a general equilibrium context, the relationship between this measure and the microeconomic variables of a firm has not been studied in the literature. This paper develops a model of the firm under uncertainty and derives the relationship between systematic risk and such firm variables as monopoly power, demand elasticity, and the labor-capital ratio. The general conclusions are surprisingly robust and point to several interesting empirically testable hypotheses.

Title: Adverse Selection by Markets and the Advantage of Being Late
Abstract: Among firms entering a market sequentially, operating under imperfect information and hiring workers with the same observable characteristics, it is shown that in the presence of transaction costs or "lock-in" effects each new firm offers a wage above the one previously offered and obtains higher profits than previous entrants. On average, each new firm gets more able workers than the previous firms, and at any point in time those workers employed by firms are less able than those self-employed. Also, it is shown that a Nash equilibrium entry ordering for firms exits.

Title: Keynes's "Finance" Demand for Liquidity, Robertson's Loanable Funds Theory, and Friedman's Monetarism
Abstract: This paper argues that Keynes's concession on the finance demand for liquidity provides the key for the reconciliations of the liquidity preference theory to the loanable funds theory and of the stock approach with the flow approach. On many practical issues, Robertson is shown to be right, and Keynes wrong. It also shows that the modern arch-critic of Keynes, Friedman, is himself under Keynes's influence in relying exclusively upon the stock (or portfolio) approach to the neglect of the influences of flow decisions on the money demand. His attempt to combine Keynes and Fisher is shown not workable.

Title: A Rehabilitation of the Principle of Insufficient Reason
Abstract: It is shown that two of the axioms necessary for the expected utility rule imply the Principle of Insufficient Reason. Whenever a decision maker knows the possible states of the world, but completely lacks information about the plausibility of each single state, he has to behave as if all states occurred with the same objective probability, known with certainty. The result is applied to decision trees and used to solve a problem formulated by Savage in order to discredit the classical version of the Principle of Insufficient Reason.

Title: Exports in an Imperfect Competition Framework: An Analysis of 1,446 Exporters
Abstract: This paper explores empirically how export-competing performance is related to domestic and foreign market structure. Recent theoretical propositions that link elements of international and industrial economics are successfully tested on a vast sample of micro data. By means of nonparametric statistics as well as of regression analysis, firm size, industrial concentration, product differentiation, location, information, and foreign subsidiaries are shown to be important elements in explaining Belgian exports behavior. Among the suggestions for economic policy that emerge, it appears that fostering large domestic sales of a firm and domestic concentration or discouraging direct investment abroad will put a brake on export rates.

Title: Intertemporal Price Discrimination and Sticky Prices
Abstract: It is shown that potential entry leads to a marginal-revenue-below-marginal-cost rule, while the possibility of building up inventories (voluntarily!) leads to the intertemporal price discrimination rule, which provides a formal rationalization for normal costing. Equilibrium conditions for a group of firms are derived, using the intertemporal discrimination rule. These conditions can be written as linear estimating equations, with regression coefficients explicitly linked with parameters representing market structure. They imply that, in more concentrated industries, cost increases are less fully transmitted and changes in demand are more fully transmitted into prices than in less concentrated industries.

Title: Stockholder Unanimity in Making Production and Financial Decisions
Abstract: We show that "spanning" does not imply stockholder unanimity if there is trading in the shares of firms. Each basis vector of the space spanned by all firms' output vectors can be treated like a composite commodity. If, in addition to spanning, firms act as price takers with respect to prices of composite commodities, then there is unanimity. We analyze the spanning assumption for the vector space of contingent claims generated by firms' choices of debt-equity ratios. We show that there is a strong relationship between the Modigliani-Miller theorem, spanning, and the existence of a complete set of markets.

Title: The Effect of Shifting Wealth Ownership on the Term Structure of Interest Rates: The Case of Pensions
Abstract: Substantial shifts in wealth ownership from individuals to pension funds are currently taking place in the United States and also are in prospect for the foreseeable future. Moreover, pension funds typically exhibit portfolio preferences that are markedly different from those of individuals. In a world of heterogeneous investors, redistributions among wealth holders with different portfolio preferences will in general alter the structure of asset yields. Partial-equilibrium simulation experiments based on a model of the U. S. long-term bond market indicate that redistributions of saving flows from individuals to pension funds, in plausible magnitudes, can have major effects on the term structure of interest rates.

Title: The Term Structure of Interest Rates and the Demand for Investment
Abstract: This paper examines the question of whether long-term or short-term interest rates should appear in investment demand functions. Three basic models are examined. The first involves a distribution of time lags required to complete investment projects; the second is based on a simple adjustment-costs model; and the third incorporates uncertainty and risk aversion. The major conclusion is that, except for some special cases which are probably quite unrealistic, both long-term and short-term interest rates affect investment demand.

Title: The Exit-Voice Tradeoff in the Labor Market: Unionism, Job Tenure, Quits, and Separations
Abstract: This paper examines the effect of trade unionism on the exit behavior of workers in the context of Hirschman's exit-voice dichotomy. Unionism is expected to reduce quits and permanent separations and raise job tenure by providing a "voice" alternative to exit when workers are dissatisfied with conditions. Empirical evidence supports this contention, showing significantly lower exit for unionists in several large data tapes. It is argued that the grievance system plays a major role in the reduction in exit and that the reduction lowers cost and raises productivity.

Title: Schumpeterian Competition
Abstract: This paper describes a stochastic model of the process of competition via technological innovation as it might occur within a single industry. Individual firms undertake R&amp;D projects in the hope of acquiring a decisive competitive advantage over their rivals. But such advantages and the economic rents arising from this are only temporary; they eventually disappear in the face of imitation, entry, and innovation by other firms. At the industry's long-run equilibrium, concentration and the pace of technological innovation are jointly determined by the conditions of entry and the extent of innovative opportunity. The model implies relationships among these variables that have in fact been detected in the empirical R&amp;D literature.

Title: The Product Cycle and New England Textiles
Abstract: Technological change and product life cycle concepts can be used to explain the concentration of cotton textile production in Southeastern New England during the industry's period of rapid innovation in machinery and machine tool design. Boston was the center for an agglomeration of high technology industries that were attracted by each other and the local resource pool of skilled mechanics and entrepreneurs. The movement of the textile industry to the Southeast, which took place after 1880, is linked to technological change in the product cycle that substituted unskilled labor for skilled labor and high technology inputs. The phrase "Yankee ingenuity" has become a part of the English language. If New England no longer holds all the good mechanics in the United States, there was a time when she came so near it that the term "New England mechanic" had a very definite meaning over the whole country [Roe, 1916, p. 109].

Title: Efficient Incentive Contracts
Abstract: A so-called "incentive contract" is a linear payment schedule, where the buyer pays a fixed fee plus some proportion of audited project cost. That remaining proportion of project cost borne by the seller is called the "sharing ratio." A higher sharing ratio creates more incentive to reduce costs. But it also makes the agent bear more cost uncertainty, requiring as compensation a greater fixed fee. The tradeoff between incentives and risk in determining the sharing ratio of an efficient contract is the central theme of the present paper. A formula is derived that shows how the optimal sharing ratio depends on such features as uncertainty, risk aversion, and the contractor's ability to control costs. Some numerical examples are calculated from the area of defense contracting.

Title: Wages, Flexible Exchange Rates, and Macroeconomic Policy
Abstract: In an open economy with a floating exchange rate, the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy depends fundamentally on the wage-setting process. In the canonical models of Mundell and Fleming, monetary expansion raises output via an exchange rate depreciation, while fiscal expansion has no output effect. These results hold only when real wages can be altered by exchange rate movements; if the real wage is fixed, the Mundell-Fleming ranking of policy is reversed. This paper explores the interaction of wages and policy in short- and long-run models, under the assumptions of perfect foresight and world capital mobility.

Title: A Theory of Social Custom, of which Unemployment may be One Consequence
Abstract: This paper examines adherence to social customs. Models of social customs are found to be inherently multi-equilibrial. It is found that social customs which are disadvantageous to the individual may nevertheless persist without erosion, if individuals are sanctioned by loss of reputation for disobedience of the custom. One example of such a social custom is the persistence of a fair (rather than a market-clearing) wage. In this fashion, involuntary unemployment is explained.

Abstract: This study provides the first econometric analysis of the effect of taxation on the realization of capital gains. The analysis thus extends and complements the earlier study by Feldstein and Yitzhaki [1978] of the effect of taxation on the selling of corporate stock. The present analysis, using a large, new body of data obtained from individual tax returns, supports the earlier finding that corporate stock sales are quite sensitive to tax rates and then shows that the effect on the realization of capital gains is even stronger.

Applications to labor market models based on productivity quotas and time-profiles of wages, and an exploratory model of the "information content" of corporate dividends are discussed. The last application focuses on intertemporal consistency requirements and the role of insider trading observations.

Title: On Transactions and Precautionary Demand for Money
Abstract: This paper develops a stochastic framework for determining transactions and precautionary demand for money. Through application of the principles of inventory management, the analysis integrates and extends the work of Baumol, Tobin, and Miller and Orr. Optimal money holdings are shown to depend on the rate of interest, on the mean and the variance of net disbursements and on the cost of portfolio adjustment. The properties of the distribution of the payment period are analyzed. The optimal solution is obtained by minimizing net present value of cost. This solution is compared with the one obtained by the conventional method of minimizing the steady-state cost.

Title: Job Search and the Labor Dropout Problem Reconsidered
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence of an equilibrium wage distribution for a labor market in which job seekers search sequentially. The search model shows why some workers will drop out of the market. Previous analysis of policies designed to reduce the number of dropouts was partial because wage distributions were exogenously given. Through the use of the equilibrium wage distribution implied by each policy, the analysis here shows that subsidizing search or imposing a minimum wage will reduce the number of dropouts, while a job training program or a reduction in unemployment compensation may either increase or decrease the number of dropouts.

Title: David Hume and Monetarism
Abstract: Of the twelve characteristics of modern monetarism, five are explicit in Hume's writings: the quantity theory, the Chicago transmission process, private sector stability, the vertical Phillips curve, which Hume originated, and preference for free markets. Two others, irrelevance of allocative detail and focus on the price level as a unit, are implicit. Preference for reduced-form models fits Hume's theory of causation. Preference for stable money growth fits the whole tenor of Hume's discussion. Two propositions on targets and indicators were irrelevant in Hume's day, but Hume rejected the monetarists' strong opposition to inflation.

Title: Choosing New Industrial Capacity: On-Site EXpansion, Branching, and Relocation
Abstract: A manufacturing firm can increase its capacity through expansion at existing sites, opening new plants, or relocating to new, larger space. These options are in fact not very good substitutes for one another. This paper argues why one might be preferred to the others and supports its view of the capacity choice with detailed evidence from over 400 plants in New England.

Title: Soviet Household Saving: A Cross-Section Study of Soviet Emigrant Families
Abstract: This study examines the saving patterns of Soviet households by developing a saving function based on cross-section data derived from a family budget survey of Soviet emigrants. The results are very similar to those of Western studies. While saving is a positive function of current income, the average rate of saving rises only relatively mildly with income, indicating that current income from the public sector is much more "permanent" than in market economies. The proportion of income earned from the private sector that is saved is much higher—indicating that it is highly transitory and risky. The long-run saving rate is, by international comparison, rather low.

Title: Irving Fisher on His Head II: The Consequences of the Timing of Payments for the Demand for Money
Abstract: This paper explores the consequences of the timing of payments for the demand for money. It is found that if payments are the minimum of the money in the bank account or bills due, the demand for money will respond slowly to changes in income. This prediction disagrees with some formulations of the short-run demand for money (e.g., Irving Fisher's) but agrees with empirical estimates. The demand for money is adjusted to supply by changes in quantities (i.e., payments flows) rather than by changes in prices or interest rates.

Title: Personal Wealth Transfers
Abstract: A theory of personal wealth transfers is developed which implies that components given to a recipient, such as education and bequests, are perfect substitutes. Therefore, components whose marginal cost rises more rapidly than average reveal wealth elasticities that are smaller than average. For related reasons, time series elasticities are expected to fall short of cross-sectional elasticities. An empirical investigation estimates cross-sectional wealth elasticities of gifts and bequests and time series wealth elasticities of bequest. The estimates are ranked in the order that is anticipated from the theory.

Title: Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory with a Continuum of Goods
Abstract: This paper studies trade theory for the case of a continuum of goods, two factors, two countries, and Cobb-Douglas demand functions. If factor endowments are similar, factor price equalization obtains and geographic patterns of production are indeterminate; nonetheless the effects of changes in factor endowments on prices and welfare in each country are well defined. Factor price equalization does not obtain if factor endowments are far apart, and the geographic pattern of specialization is then determinate. The effects of changes in endowments on the range of goods produced in each country and on prices of goods and factors are analyzed for this case, and the elasticity of substitution in production is shown to play an important role in determining comparative static outcomes.

Title: A Compensation Measure of the Cost of Unemployment to the Unemployed
Abstract: Under the assumption that unemployment is the result of job rationing, Hicks's compensating variation measures the payment that would make a worker indifferent between employment at his desired annual hours and rationed employment. This theory is applied at the individual level to find the compensation for the rationing. It varies according to the position of the compensated labor supply function, the wage rate, and the duration of unemployment. The individual measures are aggregated for each year from 1967 through 1975. The aggregate measure varies sharply with the level of unemployment; but it is small when compared with more conventional measures such as the difference between actual GNP and potential GNP.

Title: The Effects of Supply Contracts on the Output and Price of an Exhaustible Resource
Abstract: This paper analyzes the effects of contracts for exhaustible resources. The conclusions are as follows: (1) for a single mine, with increased risk production for the spot market falls, long-term contracting increases, total output falls, contract length generally decreases, equilibrium spot prices increase, and contract prices may rise or fall; (2) with changing economies because of past production, output (spot prices) rises (fall) and then falls (rise), and this scalloped pattern remains with entry and storage included; and (3) contracting permits pairwise gains, may create losses for others, and prices are "fuzzy" signals as they may change for several different reasons.

Title: A Method for Determining the Appropriateness of National Planning in a Market Economy
Abstract: Meade demonstrates how, in the absence of futures markets for many commodities, indicative planning can supply economic agents with the requisite information about future market conditions. An incentive scheme designed to encourage agents to relay accurate information to central planners is introduced into Meade's model. It is then shown how the Groves and Loeb voting procedure can be used to determine whether an indicative planning program would be beneficial.

Title: A Model of International Trade and Finance
Abstract: An equilibrium model of international trade, payments, and financial asset flows is developed with implications for the relationship between asset returns and changes in the relative prices of consumption goods of different countries. The model focuses on international trade as enlarging the opportunity for intertemporal exchange. The main source of uncertainty in the model is revisions of investors' expectations of the profitability of country-specific capital. The model is extended to include money to demonstrate how international monetary agreements may affect individual portfolio decisions.

Title: The Regional Distribution of Population, Migration, and Climate
Abstract: Regional migration is analyzed utilizing a model that develops a system of urban areas. The areas differ in their endowment of a site-specific factor—climate is used as the example. The effects of differences in tax rates and technology are determined in a model where the price of housing is endogenous. Compensation for an inferior climate occurs through regional differences in income levels or the price of housing, dependent on the manner in which climate affects production or consumption. The market distribution of households is found to be suboptimal in cases where utility is derived directly from the consumption of climate.

Title: Bank Attitude Toward Risk, Implicit Rates of Interest, and the Behavior of an Index of Risk Aversion for Commercial Banks
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of a quasi-risk-averse bank facing uncertainty with respect to demand deposit flows and default risk on loans. On the basis of a formal model, testable hypotheses of bank attitude toward risk and the qualitative behavior of the index of relative risk aversion for commercial banks are developed. Through the use of data on the member banks of the Tenth Federal Reserve District, the empirical tests that were conducted indicated that banks are strongly risk-averse and that their index of relative risk aversion is increasing in profits. These results suggest that favorable (unfavorable) environmental changes will generate income effects that will result in proportionately less (more) risk taking by banks.

Title: The Optimum Monetary Aggregate for Stabilization Policy
Abstract: This paper presents a procedure for determining the optimal monetary aggregate for stabilization policy. To illustrate the procedure, a simple stochastic IS-LM model is used, and how, in general, stabilizing an aggregate consisting of both money and interest bearing government debt will provide superior stabilization for output is shown. The relative weight given to the two components in the aggregate may vary widely, depending upon the source of random disturbances in the economy. Also, for a specific weight, stabilizing the aggregate is equivalent to stabilizing the interest rate. Finally, we show how stabilizing the aggregate is equivalent to other forms of optimal monetary policy proposed by Poole, and Kareken, Muench, and Wallace.

Title: A Growth Model for a Tenured-Labor-Managed Firm
Abstract: The theory of the labor-managed firm is a recent addition to the economic literature on organization. Analyses of the behavior of workers' self-managed firms have produced two versions of the theory. The present paper is primarily concerned with the employment decisions of labor-managed firms, which are analyzed within the framework of a new model drawing upon both versions of the existing theory. We present a growth model for a firm characterized by the division of labor between tenured and nontenured workers, whose aim is the intertemporal maximization of the net income per tenured worker. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we obtain the optimality conditions, the transition path, and the steady state for the model. We also analyze a series of policy alternatives. Some references are made to the Yugoslav economy.

Title: Nontraded Goods and the Balance of Trade in a Neo-Keynesian Temporary Equilibrium
Abstract: This paper explores the implications for international monetary economics of recent work on macroeconomic models of temporary equilibrium with rationing. A model of a small open economy is presented, which, though fully consistent in the long run with the monetary approach to the balance of payments, behaves very differently in the short run when the wage and the price of nontradeables are sticky. Among the comparative statics properties of the model are the following: a devaluation may not improve the trade balance; a wage cut may not increase employment; and technological progress has different effects, depending on the sector in which it occurs.

Title: Job Differentiation and Wages
Abstract: The determination of wage rates and skill requirements for jobs is studied in a model where workers, who vary in ability, acquire skill through (costly) training. If firms' skill requirements are fixed, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in wage rates, but the resulting allocation of labor is inefficient. The Nash equilibrium wage rates and allocation of labor approach the competitive equilibrium if and only if the number of job types increases on every skill range and no firm remains a monopsonist on any skill range. If firms choose both skill requirements and wage rates, no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies exists.

Title: The Distribution of Income by Factor Components
Abstract: The paper provides a rigorous and exact formulation of the relationship between the Gini measure of inequality in total income across families, and corresponding measures of inequality in such components of total income as wages, transfer income, etc. It is shown that serious problems of bias arise when individual family data are not available and when data on averages for families grouped by the size of total income are used instead. These problems are illustrated with reference to data for Taiwan, 1964 to 1976.

Title: On Oligopolistic Markets for Nonrenewable Natural Resources
Abstract: Noncooperative oligopoly behavior in nonrenewable resource markets is analyzed under stationary conditions assuming perfect information. The existence of Cournot-Nash equilibria in output paths is established under standard cost and demand assumptions, and a number of comparative dynamic results are obtained. If all suppliers have the same costs, for instance, and total reserves are fixed, either increasing the number of suppliers or equalizing their reserve holdings causes more rapid resource use. If suppliers' costs differ, it is shown that equilibrium involves inefficient production; high-cost reserves may even be exhausted before low-cost reserves.

Title: Notes on Advertising, Economies of Scale, and Entry Barriers
Abstract: The paper discusses how advertising and economies of scale in production interact to produce economies of scale. The latter are defined to occur when costs per dollar of revenues decline with revenues. It is argued that, in an industry with differentiated products and advertising, it is the declining costs per collar of revenues rather than declining production costs per unit of output that directly affects entry barriers and the profitability of established firms.

Title: Wealth and Wealth Proxies in a Permanent Income Model
Abstract: This paper formulates a permanent income model of consumer expenditures. Through use of this model, measures of permanent income are examined that are alternatively based on (a) measured income patterns, (b) stocks of consumer liquid assets, (c) stocks of consumer financial assets, and (d) stocks of consumer real and financial assets. Using assets in permanent income measures is found to improve upon using measured income patterns in explaining consumer expenditure. Consumer assets are further found not to be treated as one homogeneous stock by consumers. Money and risky financial assets contribute significantly to explaining consumer spending, while savings and real assets are of no value. Finally, asset effects on consumption are found to be inelastic but statistically significant.

Title: Bayes Rule as a Descriptive Model: The Representativeness Heuristic
Abstract: Results of experiments designed to test the claim of psychologists that expected utility theory does not provide a good descriptive model are reported. The deviation from tested theory is that, in revising beliefs, individuals ignore prior or base-rate information contrary to Bayes rule. Flaws in the evidence in the psychological literature are noted, an experiment avoiding these difficulties is designed and carried out, and the psychologists' predictions are stated in terms of a more general model. The psychologists' predictions are confirmed for inexperienced or financially unmotivated subjects, but for others the evidence is less clear.

Title: Generalized Findlay-Grubert Theorem
Abstract: This generalization allows the relative price to vary and explicitly considers Hicks-, Harrod-, and Solow-neutrality. Under certain conditions, the Harrod-neutral and the Solow-neutral shifts are equivalent to the Hicks factor-saving shift. If Hicks-Harrod-Solow neutral or the Hicks factor-saving improvement occurs in one of the two sectors, then the relative price of that good falls, and the level of output of that good increases. However, the level of output of the other good remains constant if Hicks-Harrod-Solow-neutral progress occurs, and decreases or increases according to whether the Hicks x-saving or x-using technological progress occurs in the x-intensive sector.

Title: Unionization and Productivity: Micro-Econometric Evidence
Abstract: It is widely agreed that unionization affects the rules and procedures governing the employment relation in organized establishments. The effect of these changes on establishment productivity, however, is unclear. This issue is examined using establishment level data from the U. S. cement industry. A positive union effect on the order of 6–8 percent is found in both cross-section and time series data. Although some caution is in order in interpreting the results, the evidence suggests that unionization can lead to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise.

Title: "Rational" Duopoly Equilibria
Abstract: This paper examines duopoly models in which each firm tries to guess the reaction of its rival to a change in its output. We seek equilibria in which the guesses are accurate, or "rational." For static models we discover that many output combinations (X, Y) can fit into such equilibria and that our concept of "rationality" must necessarily be one-sided: if a firm has accurate expectations at (X, Y) about its rival's reactions, the competitor's reactions cannot themselves be based on "rational" calculations. Turning to a dynamic model, we find that an oversupply of solution pairs continues to be a problem.

Title: Technology, Entrepreneurs, and Firm Size
Abstract: We analyze Schumpeterian entrepreneurship within a general equilibrium model of a competitive economy patterned after Lucas. All individuals have access to exogenously growing knowledge. Those who acquire sufficient knowledge become entrepreneurs. If learning is only a function of ability, the faster the progress, the fewer the entrepreneurs, and the higher their pay relative to workers' wages. If knowledge is only a function of lifetime, the faster the progress is, the earlier the entry will be into the entrepreneurial group. When age and ability are considered together, the individuals (if any) who become entrepreneurs with faster progress are younger and more able than those (if any) who drop out of the group.

Title: Public-Private Consumption Tradeoffs and the Balanced Budget Multiplier
Abstract: This paper considers consumers who have multiperiod utility functions that have private and public goods as arguments. The paper analyzes the effect on private demands of various exogenous balanced budget changes in the path of public expenditure: temporary, permanent, and countercyclical. The effects of temporary and countercyclical changes depend upon whether public and private goods are complements or substitutes and whether public goods are over- or undersupplied. The largest impact comes from countercyclical changes in undersupplied complementary public goods. Permanent changes tend to have a smaller impact but are harder to specify, since the results crucially depend upon the third derivatives of utility functions.

Title: Experience, Performance, and Earnings
Abstract: This study provides direct evidence concerning the relationship between experience and performance among managerial and professional employees doing similar work in two major U. S. corporations. The facts presented indicate that while, within grade levels, there is a strong positive association between experience and relative earnings, there is either no association or a negative association between experience and relative rated performance. If we are correct that the performance ratings given to managerial and professional employees in any grade level adequately reflect those employees' relative productivity in the year of assessment, the results imply that the human capital on-the-job training model cannot explain a substantial part of the observed return to labor market experience.

Title: Technology Transfer to Overseas Subsidiaries by U. S.-Based Firms
Abstract: Although economists and policy makers have devoted considerable attention to the transfer of technology by U. S.-based multinational firms to their overseas subsidiaries, very little is known about the nature of the technology that is being transferred overseas in this way, the extent to which it leaks out to non-U. S. competitors, the size of the benefits it confers on the host (and other non-U. S.) countries, and the sorts of non-U. S. firms that receive the largest benefits of this sort. This paper presents findings that shed new light on each of these topics.

Title: Factor Market Dynamics and the Incidence of Taxes and Subsidies
Abstract: We extend work on payroll tax incidence by recognizing that labor markets adjust slowly because of the slow adjustment of both labor demand and supply to their equilibrium values. We modify the basic model of the incidence of payroll taxes with variable factor supply to include dynamic adjustments. We find that, under reasonable assumptions about the magnitudes of the lags in adjustment, it takes several years before half of the distance to a new equilibrium in wages and employment is reached. Thus, even if payroll taxes are borne by labor in the long run, a large part of any increase in the tax will be borne by capital for some time. For purposes of policy, the effects of payroll tax increases must be analyzed as if part of their effect is on profits, regardless of the long-run distribution of the burden.
