Title: Assessing Dynamic Efficiency: Theory and Evidence
Abstract: The issue of dynamic efficiency is central to analyses of capital accumulation and economic growth. Yet the question of what characteristics should be examined to determine whether actual economies are dynamically efficient is unresolved. This paper develops a criterion for determining whether an economy is dynamically efficient. The criterion, which holds for economies in which technological progress and population growth are stochastic, involves a comparison of the cash flows generated by capital with the level of investment. Its application to the United States economy and the economies of other major OECD nations suggests that they are dynamically efficient.

Title: Demand for Differentiated Products, Discrete Choice Models, and the Characteristics Approach
Abstract: We propose a specific characteristics framework in order to construct linkages between alternative conceptual approaches to modelling product differentiation. First, it is shown that a demand system which satisfies the gross substitutes property imposes specific requirements on the locations of products. In particular, the dimension of the characteristics space must be larger than or equal to the number of products minus one. We then identify a method for casting a given demand system (subject to certain restrictions) into our characteristics framework. This is illustrated for the logit, probit and linear probability models of discrete choice theory. Finally, we find a characteristics representation of the CES representative consumer.

Title: Estimation in a Class of Simultaneous Equation Limited Dependent Variable Models
Abstract: Estimation in a class of simultaneous equation limited dependent variable models is considered. The minimum Chi-squared method is used to compare the asymptotic relative efficiency of marginal and new conditional maximum likelihood estimators for this class of models. Efficient minimum Chi-squared estimation procedures are described. A two-step algorithm based on a conditional maximum likelihood estimator provides a natural framework for both computing a linearized and locating the joint maximum likelihood estimator. The unimodality of the simultaneous equation tobit likelihood function is proved and this model is used to illustrate the empirical application of some of the estimators considered in the paper. The relative efficiency of these estimators in the simultaneous equation tobit model is examined in a set of Monte-Carlo experiments.

Title: Non-cooperative Bargaining and Union Formation
Abstract: We study a union formation decision problem when workers consist of two groups distinguished by different productivities. Workers may form either a joint union or two separate unions. The whole decision process is modelled as an extensive-form bargaining game. Workers form a joint union when the sizes or productivities of the groups are similar. In the first case, there is a wage differential which is more (less) than proportional to the productivity difference if the size of the more productive is smaller (larger) than that of the less productive. In the second case, there is no wage differential.

Title: Money and Loans
Abstract: Agents expect to trade with each other infinitely often, but face a temporal absence of a coincidence of wants when they meet. Only loans and/or money can facilitate exchange. In small close-knit economies, enduring trade relationships are valued and loans are optimal. In larger economies, with limited communication, information concerning repayment of loans diffuses too slowly to deter agents from reneging unless loans are severely restricted in magnitude. Money has no such redeemability problems, but if Clower constraints bind, loans help supplement money purchases so that both become essential. Roles of various institutions and the historical evolution of media of exchange are explained.

Title: A Viable Gold Standard Requires Flexible Monetary and Fiscal Policy
Abstract: The paper studies an idealized gold standard in a two-country setting. Without flexible national domestic credit expansion (dce) policies which offset the effect of money demand shocks on international gold reserves, the gold standard collapses with certainty in finite time through a speculative selling attack against one of the currencies. Various policies for postponing a collapse are considered.When a responsive dce policy eliminates the danger of a run on a country's reserves, the exogenous shocks disturbing the system which previously were reflected in reserve flows, now show up in the behaviour of the public debt. Unless the primary (non-interest) government deficit is permitted to respond to these shocks, the public debt is likely to rise (or fall) to unsustainable levels. For the idealized gold standard analysed in the paper, viability can be achieved only through the active and flexible use of monetary and fiscal policy.

Title: Intergenerational Altruism, Dynastic Equilibria and Social Welfare
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore the welfare properties of dynastic equilibria. There are three central findings. First, under relatively weak conditions, welfare optima cannot be implemented as dynastic equilibria with positive levels of transfers. Second, intergenerational altruism ordinarily renders the objectives of social planners dynamically inconsistent, thereby making implementation of welfare optima problematic. Third, if a planner successfully resolves dynamic inconsistency by committing himself to respect the preferences of deceased generations, and if there are a sufficient number of prior generations, then in a specific set of cases dynastic equilibria are approximately welfare optimal.

Title: Uncertainty and the Choice of Trade Policy in Oligopolistic Industries
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of trade policies in an uncertain world. Governments in each of two countries select between direct quantity controls and subsidies in an attempt to shift profits in favour of domestic, imperfectly competitive firms. The equilibrium of this bilateral policy game depends critically on the variability of the environment. In a world of certainty, both governments would choose to regulate the behaviour of their firms through direct quantity controls. With a sufficient amount of uncertainty, both governments regulate their firms through subsidies. This result reflects an important tradeoff between the strategic advantages of direct quantity controls and flexibility gained by the use of subsidies

Title: On the Economics of Institutional Care of the Elderly in the U.S.: The Effects of a Change in Government Reimbursement
Abstract: We present an optimization model of a nursing home which incorporates the following characteristics: proprietary profit maximization, the distinction between private and Medicaid patients, non-essential expenditure aimed at market identification, and cost-based government reimbursement. The model is used to analyze the effect of changes in government reimbursement. The theoretical analysis indicates that increases in government reimbursement need not lead to increases in non-essential cost expenditures and private patient charges; in fact the contrary may result. The econometric analysis suggests empirical support for the latter. Higher reimbursement factors are associated with lower charges.

Title: Simultaneous Equations Bias in Disaggregated Econometric Models
Abstract: In the theory of competitive markets agents act as if they do not affect prices. By analogy with the language of econometrics, agents may be said to take prices as "exogenously given", which suggests that prices are econometrically exogenous in individual behavioural equations. This involves semantic confusion between different meanings of the word "exogenous". Simultaneity problems cannot generally be dispelled by working with disaggregated data. In particular, nothing is gained by disaggregating the dependent variable in a regression equation if the "micro" and "macro" equations use the same regressors. However, there may be substantial gains from disaggregation of the regressors.

Title: Inventories in the Open Economy Macro Model: A Disequilibrium Analysis
Abstract: This study examines a disequilibrium model of a small open economy with explicit links between periods due to inventory accumulation, as well as the more conventional channels through current account imbalances and the government budget constraint. The key features of the model are that agents have perfect foresight with neutral public debt and that inventories adjust to smooth production intertemporarily. The paper explores the extent to which fiscal policy can be used selectively for coping with an export slump without running into a balance of payments constraint.

Title: Litigation and Settlement under Two-Sided Incomplete Information
Abstract: This paper deals with a simple game of litigation and settlement with incomplete information. Parties are assumed to have the choice between settling their dispute out of court or resorting to costly litigation. The set of sequential equilibria is characterized and conditions are given under which an efficient equilibrium does exist. Efficient equilibria, however, will be ruled out by various tests of refinement. A comparative statics analysis is carried out with respect to the quality of private information which parties are assumed to receive before any moves have to be made.

Title: The Equilibrium and Optimal Timing of Price Changes
Abstract: This paper studies the welfare properties of the equilibrium timing of price changes. Staggered price setting has the advantage that it permits rapid adjustment to firm-specific shocks, but the disadvantages that it causes unwanted fluctuations in relative prices and that, by creating price level inertia, it can increase aggregate fluctuations. Because each firm ignores its contribution to these problems, staggering can be a stable equilibrium even if it is highly inefficient. In addition, there can be multiple equilibria in the timing of prices changes; indeed, whenever there is an inefficient staggered equilibrium, there is also an efficient equilibrium with synchronized price setting.

Title: Productivity- and Pareto-Improving Changes in Taxes and Tariffs
Abstract: The paper investigates the problem of tariff reform in a small open multi-household economy that only has tariffs and domestic commodity taxes as policy instruments. The concept of a productivity improvement in tariffs and taxes is introduced and conditions for its existence are established. We prove that a Pareto-improving change in tariffs and domestic taxes exists if a productivity-improving change in tariffs exists and if the Weymark condition on the matrix of household demands holds. Conditions are established for particular tariff reforms, such as proportional reductions and reductions of extreme rates, to yield Pareto improvements in welfare.

Title: Market Size and Substitutability in Imperfect Competition: A Bertrand-Edgeworth-Chamberlin Model
Abstract: Competition is often associated with the idea that there are many traders in the market or that each price maker is small as compared to the market. This paper introduces this notion of market size in a model of price competition with imperfect substitutes by constructing a model which creates a bridge between the Chamberlin and Bertrand-Edge worth lines of work on price competition. We investigate the role of two fundamental parameters in the existence of an equilibrium: the market size, given by the number n of competitors, and the degree of substitutability. We prove that: (a) For a given number of n ≦ 2 of competitors, a sufficiently large but finite degree of substitutability entails nonexistence. This thus generalizes the Bertrand-Edgeworth nonexistence result, which applies only to perfect substitutes, (b) Conversely for a given upper bound on the degree of substitutability, a sufficiently large number of competitors ensures existence, which thus introduces a significant role for market size in models of imperfect competition. We finally investigate the proximity of an equilibrium (when it exists) to a "competitive outcome", and we find that both high substitutability and large market size are a condition for competitiveness.

Title: Trade and Insurance with Adverse Selection
Abstract: This paper considers a small open economy with a safe sector and a risky sector. The probability of success in the risky activity differs across individuals, and is private information. It is shown that policies that sustain informationally constrained Pareto optima should not include tariffs. A laissez-faire competitive equilibrium, if it exists, is Pareto optimal. These results contrast with previous literature on the role of tariffs as insurance, where private risk markets are assumed away in an ad hoc manner.

Title: Research and Development and Intra-industry Spillovers: An Empirical Application of Dynamic Duality
Abstract: In this paper we estimate a model of production and investment based on the theory of dynamic duality. We are particularly interested in the effects of R&amp;D spillovers and in calculating the social and private rates of return. There are three effects associated with the intra-industry R&amp;D spillover. First, costs decline as knowledge expands for the externality-receiving firms. Second, production structures are affected, as factor demands change in response to the spillover. Third, the rates of capital accumulation are affected by the R&amp;D spillover. These cost-reducing, factor-biasing and capital adjustment effects are estimated for four industries. The existence of R&amp;D spillovers implies that the social and private rates of return to R&amp;D capital differ. We estimate that the social return exceeds the private return in each industry. Moreover, there is significant variation across industries in the differential between the social and private rates of return.

Title: Endogenous Market Thinness and Stock Price Volatility
Abstract: Thin equity markets cannot accommodate temporary bulges of buy or sell orders without large price movements. The resulting volatility can induce risk-averse transactors who face transaction costs to desert these markets. Thus thinness and the related price volatility may become joint self-perpetuating features of an equity market, irrespective of the volatility of asset fundamentals. If, however, appropriate incentive schemes are adopted to encourage entry by additional investors, this vicious circle can be broken, eventually shifting the market to a self-sustaining, superior equilibrium characterized by a higher number of transactors, lower price volatility and larger supply of the asset.

Title: Price Aggregation When Price-Taking Firms' Prices Vary
Abstract: In many cases, heterogeneous prices occur in price-taking environments. In empirical work, an aggregate price index is often created from such prices and used to explain aggregate supply and derived demands. We show that consistent aggregation places strong restrictions on functional forms which may be used to describe behaviour. Unlike the case of aggregation of consumer income (but similar to the case of aggregation of wages), these functional forms are inconsistent with standard microtheory.

Title: Identification and Estimation of Equivalence Scales under Weak Separability
Abstract: This paper shows that most methods of incorporating demographic variation into separable models can be represented in a form that is identical to Barten equivalence scales, except that the scales themselves depend on the exact mix of goods that comprise each group, as well as on demographic variables. This generalization of Barten scales is shown to be more plausible than ordinary scales, can be used to increase the efficiency of demand system estimation, and can overcome Muellbauer's under-identification result for cross-sectional estimation of equivalence scales.

Title: Informed Speculation with Imperfect Competition
Abstract: Competitive rational expectations models have the unsatisfactory property, dubbed the "schizophrenia" problem by Hellwig, that each trader takes the equilibrium price as given despite the fact that he influences that price. An examination of information aggregation in a non-competitive rational expectations model using a Nash equilibrium in demand functions shows that the schizophrenia problem is avoided by having each trader take into account the effect his demand has on the equilibrium price. Given a distribution of private information across traders, prices reveal less information than in the competition equilibrium, and prices no longer become fully informative in the limit as noise trading vanishes or as traders become risk neutral. With small traders, the model may become one of monopolistic competition, not perfect competition. In contrast to the competitive model, a reasonable model of endogenous acquisition of costly private information is obtained, even when traders are risk-neutral.

Title: Why is Consumption So Smooth?
Abstract: For thirty years it has been accepted that consumption is smooth because permanent income is smoother than measured income. This paper considers the evidence for the contrary position, that permanent income is in fact less smooth than measured income, so that the smoothness of consumption cannot be straightforwardly explained by permanent income theory. The paper argues that in postwar U.S. quarterly data, consumption is smooth because it responds with a lag to changes in income.

Title: Dynamic Labour Force Participation of Married Women and Endogenous Work Experience
Abstract: This paper presents and estimates a dynamic model of married women's labour force participation and fertility in which the effect of work experience on wages is explicitly taken into account. Because current participation alters future potential earnings, the investment return to work will be an important factor in the current work decision in any forward-looking behavioural model. The model is estimated using the National Longitudinal Surveys mature women's cohort. We use the estimates of our model to predict changes in the lifecycle patterns of employment due to changes in schooling, fertility, husband's income, and the magnitude of the experience effect on wages. We find that although work experience increases the disutility of further work, the effect is overwhelmed by the positive effect of experience on wages, leading to persistence in the employment patterns of these women. In addition we find that an increase in young children and in husband's income substantially reduces participation while increased schooling has a powerful positive impact on participation.

Title: It Takes t* to Tango: Trading Coalitions with Fixed Prices
Abstract: In the Edgeworth non-tâtonnement process, trade occurs if there exists some coalition of agents able to make a Pareto-improving trade among themselves at current prices. It is known that the coalition size required is bounded by the number of commodities and that, provided all agents always have strictly positive endowments, bilateral trade suffices. These results are generalized, but it is shown that, when some agents do not hold all commodities, the information requirements for coalition formation can be very severe. Coalition size is not the only problem; very detailed information on preferences may be needed.

Title: Price Wars Caused by Switching Costs
Abstract: In many markets consumers have "switching costs", for example learning costs or transaction costs, of changing between functionally equivalent brands of a product, or of using any brand for the first time. We analyse a four-period complete-information model of a market with switching costs in which new entry occurs after the second period. The new entry results, in equilibrium, in a price war. That is, the new entrants' prices are higher in the post-entry period than in the entry period, and the incumbent's price falls in either the pre-entry period or the entry period and subsequently rises. We can interpret the incumbent's lowering its price in the pre-entry period as limit-pricing behaviour. We distinguish between two types of price war that can occur, and show how the type or mixture of types that arises depends on the size of switching costs.

Title: Dynamic Consistency, Revelations in Auctions and the Structure of Preferences
Abstract: Analyzing the optimal bidding behaviour in ascending-bid auctions and second-price sealed-bid auctions with independent private values, we show that expected utility maximizing behaviour is equivalent to: (a) dynamically consistent bidding in ascending-bid auctions; (b) the equivalence of the optimal bids in ascending-bid auctions and in second-price sealed-bid auctions; (c) bidding the value of the object in second-price sealed-bid auctions. In addition, the optimal bid in ascending-bid auctions equals the value of the object if and only if the bidder's preferences on lotteries are both quasi-concave and quasi-convex.

Title: Exchange Rate Rules, Black Market Premia and Fiscal Deficits: The Bolivian Hyperinflation
Abstract: With dual exchange rates, where a managed official exchange rate co-exists with a floating black market rate, a given budget deficit may be consistent with many different inflation rates rather than two, which is the normal result in closed economy systems. Further, all these inflation equilibria are saddle-point stable. A policy of adjusting the official exchange rate towards the black market rate may cause the economy to converge to a high-inflation, saddle-point stable equilibrium where money inflation elasticity exceeds unity. The analytics are motivated and illustrated by the Bolivian hyperinflation of 1984–1985.

Title: The Incentives to Make Commitments in Wage Bargains
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a workforce of identical workers will be better off organised in a single union rather than separate unions that bargain independently with an employer, for this will prevent the employer playing off one union against another. In this paper I show that there are circumstances where this need not be the case. If it is impossible for the firm and workers to sign long-term binding contracts on wages and employment, then the firm will wish to invest in a capital stock below the efficient level; by organising in separate unions the firm will be induced to raise its level of investment, to ensure it has enough capacity with each union to make a threat to switch production to another union credible. The effect on workers' payoffs from a higher capital stock can outweigh the loss of bargaining power as a result of the workforce being in separate unions. There will also be circumstances where the firm will invest in a capital stock that exceeds the efficient level.

Title: Asset Market Equilibrium with Short-Selling
Abstract: This paper presents simple conditions and a simple proof of the existence of equilibrium in asset markets where short-selling is allowed and satiation is possible. Unlike standard non-satiation assumptions, the one used here is weak enough to be reasonable in the mean-variance Capital Asset Pricing Model and in asset market models where investors maximize expected utility and where total returns to individual assets may be negative.

Title: The Rate of Convergence to Efficiency in the Buyer's Bid Double Auction as the Market Becomes Large
Abstract: A trader who privately knows his preferences may misrepresent them in order to influence the market price. This strategic behaviour may prevent realization of all gains from trade. In this paper, trade in a simple market with an explicit rule for price formation is modelled as a Bayesian game. We show that the difference between a trader's bid and his reservation value is maximally O(1/m) where m is the number of traders on each side of the market. Competitive pressure as m increases thus quickly overcomes the inefficiency private information causes and forces the market towards an efficient allocation.

Title: Sequential Bargaining with Correlated Values
Abstract: The paper analyzes an infinite-horizon sequential bargaining game (with one-sided offers) between a buyer and a seller when the buyer's valuation depends on the seller's; the seller knows the value of the object and the buyer does not. The influence of relative discount factors on the solution is studied. It is shown, for example, that an impasse may result if the buyer (offeror) is too impatient relative to the seller: the buyer makes a single take-it-or-leave-it offer.

Title: Hypothesis Testing in Semiparametric and Nonparametric Models for Econometric Time Series
Abstract: A restriction on a semiparametric or nonparametric econometric time series model determines the value of a finite-dimensional functional τ of an infinite-dimensional nuisance function. The estimate of τ and its estimated covariance matrix use nonparametric probability and spectral density estimation. A consequent test of the restriction is given approximate large sample justification under absolute regularity on the time series and other conditions. The methodology relates closely to recent proposals of Powell, Stock, Stoker and Robinson in cross-sectional applications, but serial dependence generally affects the test statistic's form, as well as statistical theory.

Title: Tests of Additive Derivative Constraints
Abstract: This paper proposes nonparametric tests of additive constraints on the first and second derivatives of a model E(y|x) = g(x), where the true function g is unknown. Such constraints are illustrated by the economic restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry, and the functional form restrictions of additivity and linearity. The proposed tests are based on estimates of regression coefficients, that statistically characterize the departures from the constraint exhibited by the data. The coefficients are based on weighted-average derivatives, that are reformulated in terms of derivatives of the density of x. Coefficient estimators are proposed that use nonparametric kernel estimators of the density and its derivatives. These statistics are shown to be √N consistent and asymptotically normal, and thus are comparable to estimators based on a (correctly specified) parametric model of g(x).

Title: Measuring the Strangeness of Gold and Silver Rates of Return
Abstract: The predictability of rates of return on gold and silver are examined. Econometric tests do not reject the martingale hypothesis for either asset. This failure to reject is shown to be misleading. Correlation dimension estimates indicate a structure not captured by ARCH. The correlation dimension is between 6 and 7 while the Kolmogorov entropy is about 0·2 for both assets. The evidence is consistent with a nonlinear deterministic data generating process underlying the rates of return. The evidence is certainly not sufficient to rule out the possibility of some degree of randomness being present.

Title: The Growth and Diffusion of Knowledge
Abstract: This paper analyzes a decentralized process for the diffusion of knowledge. In equilibrium, the economy converges from an initial distribution of knowledge over agents to the steady-state distribution, which is unique. Because of the public good aspect of information, too little learning takes place, and ideas are implemented too early. The key difference between earlier formulations of search externalities by Diamond, Mortensen, and Spence on the one hand, and our own on the other, is that here spillovers of knowledge depend not only on how hard people are trying, but also on the differences in what they know: if all of us know the same thing, we cannot learn from each other. The model also addresses the following two substantive questions: first, the relationship between inequality and growth, noted some time ago by Kuznets, and second, the effect on growth of improvements in the communication technology.

Title: Provision of Public Goods: Fully Implementing the Core through Private Contributions
Abstract: Standard economic intuition would say that private provision of public goods will be inefficient due to free-rider problems. This view is in contrast to the results in the literature on full implementation where it is shown that (under certain conditions) games exist which only have efficient equilibria. The games usually used to demonstrate existence are quite complex and seem "unnatural" possibly leading to the perception that implementation requires a central authority to choose and impose the game. In a simple public goods setting, we show that a very natural game—similar to one often used elsewhere in the literature to model private provision—in fact fully implements the core of this economy in undominated perfect equilibria. More specifically, we consider a complete information economy with one private good and two possible social decisions. Agents voluntarily contribute any non-negative amount of the private good they choose and the social decision is to provide the public good iff contributions are sufficient to pay for it. The contributions are refunded otherwise. The set of undominated perfect equilibrium outcomes of this game is exactly the core of the economy. We give some extensions of this result, discuss the role of perfection and alternative equilibrium notions, and discuss the intuition and implications of the results.

Title: Feasible and Continuous Implementation
Abstract: There has been a great deal of research in recent years investigating the question of whether or not there exist institutions (game forms) for which the set of equilibria will coincide with the set of Walrasian equilibria. In this paper we show the existence of a game form that is feasible, both for equilibrium and disequilibrium strategies, continuous, and for which the set of Nash equilibria coincides with the set of (constrained) Walrasian equilibria for all pure exchange economies. The game form allows agents to behave strategically both with respect to their preferences and their initial endowments.

Title: Implementation of the Lindahl Correspondence by a Single-Valued, Feasible, and Continuous Mechanism
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of designing mechanisms whose Nash allocations coincide with the Lindahl allocations for public goods economies with more than one private good. Unlike previous mechanisms, the mechanism presented here has a single-valued, feasible, and continuous outcome function. Furthermore, when there are no public goods in economies, feasible and continuous implementation of the (constrained) Walrasian correspondence can be obtained as a corollary of our Theorem 1.

Title: Transactions Demand for Money with a Stochastic, Time-Varying Interest Rate
Abstract: This paper considers a stochastic, time-varying interest rate in a continuous-time inventory-theoretic model of the demand for money. The problem of minimizing expected, discounted cash-management costs is ascribed to an agent. An optimal cash-management policy exists and is of a familiar target-threshold form. Closed-form expressions for the forward-looking, time-varying targets and thresholds are derived in special cases and implications for the dynamics of the cash balance are described.

Title: The Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference in a Productive Economy
Abstract: We consider an economy with pure factors of production, private ownership of endowments and constant returns to scale in production. Typically in such an economy, the weak axiom of revealed preference for market demand does not hold. The main reason for this is that the income distribution in such a private ownership economy depends too sensitively on the price system.
