Title: Optimal Portfolio Choice under Heterogeneous Beliefs
Abstract: This paper analyzes how an investor who is convinced that he can "beat the market" should behave when the equilibrium price process is endogenous. The investor's optimal portfolio is shown to consist of three components: (1) a tangency portfolio, (2) a hedge portfolio against changes in the market's valuation of securities, and (3) a hedging position against changes in the divergence between the investor's and the market's beliefs. The sign and magnitude of this third component will depend on investor preferences and on the divergence in the investor's and the market's quality of information. A numerical example illustrates that the effect of heterogeneous beliefs on optimal portfolio allocations can be significant. JEL classification codes: G11, G14.

Title: The Valuation of Volatility Options
Abstract: This paper examines the valuation of European- and American-style volatility options based on a general equilibrium stochastic volatility framework. Properties of the optimal exercise region and of the option price are provided when volatility follows a general diffusion process. Explicit valuation formulas are derived in four particular cases. Emphasis is placed on the MRLP(mean-reverting in the log) volatility model which has received considerable empirical support. In this context we examine the properties and hedging behavior of volatility options. Unlike American options, European call options on volatility are found to display concavity at high levels of volatility. JEL classification codes: G12, G23.

Title: Decreasing Yield Curves in a Model with an Unknown Constant Growth Rate
Abstract: The effect of incomplete information on the term structure of interest rates is examined in the framework of a pure exchange economy under uncertainty where aggregate output grows at a constant rate. If the growth rate is known, the term structure is flat. In contrast, the term structure is a decreasing curve when agents do not know the growth rate. Long term yields are less than the short rate and the yield of long term bonds is determined by the worst possible realizations of future short rates. JEL classification codes: D5, D9, E4, G1.

Title: Pricing and Hedging Discount Bond Options in the Presence of Model Risk
Abstract: This paper focuses on pricing and hedging options on a zero-coupon bond in a Heath—Jarrow—Morton (1992) framework when the value and/or functional form of forward interest rates volatility is unknown, but is assumed to lie between two fixed values. Due to the link existing between the drift and the diffusion coefficients of the forward rates in the Heath, Jarrow and Morton framework, this is equivalent to hedging and pricing the option when the underlying interest rate model is unknown. We show that a continuous range of option prices consistent with no arbitrage exist. This range is bounded by the smallest upper-hedging strategy and the largest lower-hedging strategy prices, which are characterized as the solutions of two non—linear partial differential equations. We also discuss several pricing and hedging illustrations.

Title: Do Newly Listed Derivatives Affect the Market Risk Premium in a Thin Stock Market?
Abstract: This study examines the effects on the stock market unitary risk premium and volatility associated with the listing of stock and stock index derivatives in Switzerland. Based on a univariate GARCH (1,1) specification of the stock index variance and a time-varying unitary risk premium representation, we can reject the hypothesis that stock and stock index derivatives listings do not affect the total risk premium. Contrarily to previous empirical evidence, we find that derivatives listings affect both the conditional market returns’ variance and the unitary risk premium through structural shocks. The gradual market completion hypothesis is further corroborated in that, cumulatively, the three stock and stock index options futures derivatives listings reduced the unitary risk premium while the marginal impact of each successive listing decayed.

Title: Dynamic Spanning in the Consumption-Based Capital Asset Pricing Model
Abstract: Under the assumptions of the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM), Pareto optimal consumption allocations are characterized by each agent's consumption process being adapted to the filtration generated by the aggregate consumption process of the economy. The wealth processes of the agents, however, are adapted to the finer filtration generated by aggregate consumption and the conditional distribution of future aggregate consumption. Therefore, in order to achieve pareto optimal consumption allocations, a sufficiently varied set of assets must exist such that any wealth process adapted to this finer filtration can be implemented by dynamically trading in that set of assets. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of such a set of assets based on dynamically trading contingent claims on aggregate consumption. In addition, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibria in a dynamically effectively complete market in which agents are only able to trade in contingent claims on aggregate consumption, the market portfolio of firms, and a (numeraire) zero-coupon bond. We demonstrate the role of short- and long-term contingent claims on aggregate consumption for the implementation of Pareto optimal allocations inthe presence of short- and long-term risks. In addition, in the presence of personal risks, we demonstrate the role of insurance contracts. JEL Classification: G13.

Title: Does the Governed Corporation Perform Better? Governance Structures and Corporate Performance in Germany
Abstract: Although there has been an intensive debate on the relative merits of different systems of corporate governance, empirical evidence on the link between corporate governance and firm performance almost exclusively refers to the market-oriented Anglo-Saxon system. This paper therefore investigates the more network- or bank-oriented German system. In panel regressions for 361 German corporations over the time period 1991 to 1996, we find ownership concentration to affect profitability significantly negatively. However, this effect depends intricately on stock market exposure, the location of control rights, and the time horizon (short-run vs. long-run). We conclude from our results that (1) the presence of large shareholders does not necessarily enhance profitability,(2) ownership concentration seems to be sub-optimal for many German corporations, and, finally, (3) having financial institutions as largest shareholders of traded corporations improves corporate performance.

Title: Stochastic Interest Rates and the Bond-Stock Mix
Abstract: The optimal bond-stock mix is examined in light of an apparent inconsistency between the Tobin Separation Theorem and the advice of popular investment advisors which has been pointed out by Canner et al. (1997).It is shown that the apparent inconsistency is largely explicable in terms of the hedging demands of optimising long-term investors in an environment in which the investment opportunity set is subject to stochastic shocks. The analysis points to the importance of considering investors' time horizons in analyzing optimal portfolio policies.

Title: The Valuation of Executive Stock Options in an Intensity-Based Framework
Abstract: This paper presents a general intensity-based framework to value executive stock options (ESOs). It builds upon the recent advances in the credit risk modeling arena. The early exercise or forfeiture due to voluntary or involuntary employment termination and the early exercise due to the executive’s desire for liquidity or diversification are modeled as an exogenous point process with random intensity dependent on the stock price. Two analytically tractable specifications are given where the ESO value, expected time of exercise or forfeiture, and the expected stock price at the time of exercise or forfeiture are calculated in closed-form.

Title: Optimal Hedging and Valuation of Nontraded Assets
Abstract: This paper examines a number of valuation problems faced by an expected-utility maximizing investor who, over a given time horizon, is constrained to hold an asset which cannot be replicated by dynamic trading and which therefore does not have a unique no-arbitrage price. We first derive the private valuation which the investor assigns to the nontraded asset in order to determine his optimal investment in the traded assets. We thereby show that, as part of this portfolio, the investor hedges the private valuation process of the nontraded asset, rather than its market price process. We also study the price at which the investor would be willing to sell the nontraded asset if he were subsequently prohibited from trading in it, as well as the amount the investor would be willing to pay to remove the trading restriction. All three values are shown to depend in an intuitive manner on the investor’s risk aversion, the residual risk of the nontraded asset unhedged by the traded assets, the difference between the constrained holding and optimal unconstrained holding of the asset and the length of the time horizon over which the asset cannot be traded.

Title: Non-Segmented Equilibria Under Differential Taxation: Evidence from the Canadian Government Bond Market
Abstract: This paper investigates tax effects in the Canadian government bond market during the period 1964—1986. Unlike previous studies, we apply both statistical and nonstatistical teststo analyze clientele effects and market equilibria. The results divide the sample into two distinct periods of time, with the end of 1976 marking the division. We find that tax effects are almost nonexistent in the Canadian government bond market before the end of 1976, but are predominant in the post-1976 period. Non-segmented market equilibria cannot be rejected before 1977, but are strongly rejected after 1976. In fact, segmented equilibria with clientele effects in both quantities and prices characterize the entire five year period from 1982 to 1986. These findings are consistent with tax reforms, government deficit financing and interest rate fluctuations in Canada during our sample period.

Title: Capital Structure in an Industry Equilibrium with Endogenous Liquidation Values
Abstract: This paper investigates the interaction between financial structure, liquidation values and product market equilibrium. Liquidation values depend on how many firms are liquidated, and therefore on the industry equilibrium of capital structures and of technology choices. We show that firms using a technology with high liquidation value issue less debt than those with low liquidation value even if these ones may be inefficiently liquidated. With respect to the equilibrium in the industry, we obtain that even if in equilibrium all firms use the same technology, firms will use widely different capital structures.
